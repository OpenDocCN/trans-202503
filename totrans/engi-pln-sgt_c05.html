</header>
<h2 id="h1-502321c05-0001">Introduction</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Railroads are one of the earliest forms of overland travel, and they are woven into the history of just about every country in the world. In the United States, railroads fueled enormous expansion and economic growth, perhaps more than any other technology in the 19th century. Today, railroads continue to serve as a vital mode for moving freight and people from place to place.</p>
<p>Railways take advantage of two features to provide rapid and efficient transportation of people and goods. First, the steel wheels on steel rails waste little energy to friction (especially compared to rubber tires on asphalt). Locomotives may look huge, but their engines are almost trivial compared to the enormous weight they move. If your car were so efficient, it could run off a tiny string-trimmer engine. Second, and more important, railways run along dedicated rights of way, relatively direct and unobstructed paths that are not affected by motor vehicle traffic. These reserved tracks create a level of reliability that is hard to match with other modes of travel.</p>
<p>More than any other type of infrastructure, railways enjoy a contingent of devoted enthusiasts around the world (often self-described as <em>railfans</em>). Whether it’s due to nostalgia for an earlier era or the simple appeal of seeing large machinery up close, enjoying the details of railroads is a passion for many, and there is much to enjoy. Perhaps more than the trains themselves, the paths they travel along are full of noteworthy particulars ripe for observation and appreciation.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c05-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_115" title="115"/>Railroad Tracks</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Railroad tracks consist of all the elements required to deliver train traffic quickly and smoothly to its destination. The most distinct aspect of a railway is the rail itself, which supports the tremendous weight of trains and cargo. Rails are made from high-quality steel to withstand these incredible stresses. Look closely, and you can often note markings on the <span class="SmallCaps">rail</span> <span class="SmallCaps">web</span> that list the year of manufacture and other details about how each rail was made. Rails can be of different sizes and shapes, but they mostly follow a similar form: an I-shape with a bulbous <span class="SmallCaps">head</span> upon which wheels ride and a flat <span class="SmallCaps">foot</span> attached to the ties.</p>
<p>The force required to move a train forward is transferred into the rail through friction with the driven wheels of the locomotive. Incredibly, the contact patch between each wheel and the rail is only the size of a small coin. That means an average freight train sits on an area of steel roughly the size of this book.</p>
<p>Historically, lengths of rail were bolted together using <span class="SmallCaps">fishplates</span>. The <span class="SmallCaps">joint</span> between each section creates the iconic click-clack sound as the wheels of the train pass over the small gap. These small but frequent discontinuities generate wear and tear on the railway vehicles (called <span class="SmallCaps">rolling stock</span>) and are uncomfortable for passengers. Most modern tracks use welded rails to create continuous stretches of smooth-running track with no joints.</p>
<p>One challenge of eliminating these gaps is thermal movement. Steel contracts with low temperatures and expands with heat. Where many structures provide freedom to move using expansion joints, tracks with continuously welded rail restrain this thermal movement. On cold days, the rails experience tensile stress as they try to contract. On warm days, they undergo compressive stress as they try to expand from their restraints. At some point in between, called the <em>neutral temperature</em>, the rail is free of thermal stresses. If the ambient temperature deviates too far from the neutral temperature, the stresses can exceed the track’s strength. On scorching days, railways can buckle (also called <span class="SmallCaps">sun kink</span>), creating the danger of a derailment. Rails are often warmed or stretched before installation to mitigate the possibility of buckling. This technique raises the neutral temperature of the rail so that hot days don’t overload it with thermal stress.</p>
<p>There are many ways to attach the rail to the horizontal <span class="SmallCaps">ties</span> (also called sleepers). Historically, a large steel <span class="SmallCaps">spike</span> with an offset head was hammered in place to secure each side of the rail. These spikes are still used on some railroads in the United States. More modern railways use one of many types of heavy-duty <span class="SmallCaps">clips</span>. In North America, ties are usually made from wood because of its abundance, but they can be made from concrete as well. Ties have two essential jobs: bear the weight of loads from the train traffic above and keep the two rails running with the correct space between (called the track <span class="SmallCaps">gauge</span>). Wooden <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_116" title="116"/>ties often include a <span class="SmallCaps">tie plate</span> to distribute the concentrated force of the rail.</p>
<p>Maintaining an accurate gauge is critical because of the way trains stay on the tracks. You might think a train would struggle to navigate around a bend with a solid <span class="SmallCaps">axle</span> because the outside wheel would need to turn farther than the inside wheel. Cars use a <em>differential</em> between the drive wheels so they can rotate independently around curves. Rolling stock gets around this problem by using <span class="SmallCaps">conical wheels</span>. When the train goes around a bend, each axle shifts, so the outside wheel rides on a larger radius and the inner wheel on a smaller radius. This compensates for the difference in travel distance between the inside and outside of the curve. The wheel’s <span class="SmallCaps">flange</span> is only a safety feature to keep it on a track that is damaged or out of alignment. During regular operation, it shouldn’t touch the rail at all.</p>
<p>Railroad ties do not sit directly on the ground below the track, called the <span class="SmallCaps">subgrade</span>. The soils are rarely strong enough to bear the immense weight of train traffic. Instead, an embankment of loose rock called <span class="SmallCaps">ballast</span> is used to spread the load evenly to the underlying soil. Ballast is often made from crushed stone because the angular features help it interlock into a solid foundation. Not only does it distribute the vertical forces from the track, but ballast also provides horizontal support to each tie, helping resist buckling due to thermal stress and shifting from horizontal train forces around bends. Many embankments have <span class="SmallCaps">raised</span> <span class="SmallCaps">shoulders</span> to provide extra resistance against lateral forces in each tie. The open spaces within the stone ballast allow water to flow freely through (instead of ponding up along the sides).</p>
<p>The geometry of railways is a critical component in their design. Railroads can use a much narrower right of way than a highway because they don’t need large, clear zones on each side of the travel lanes. However, trains require much gentler <span class="SmallCaps">curves</span> and grades than can be navigated by motor vehicles. <span class="SmallCaps">Couplers</span> between cars can’t handle sharp bends. Also, the centripetal force around curves can create undue stress on passengers and cargo. One solution to this problem is similar to a feature used on highways: raise the outside rail so that the train leans into curves. This tilting, also called <span class="SmallCaps">superelevation</span> or <em>cant</em>, reduces the horizontal force felt by the train.</p>
<p>As for vertical alignment, trains do not have enough traction on steel rails to brake effectively on steep slopes. Significant uphill gradients also cause trains to slow down, reducing the capacity of the railway. Next time you’re driving parallel to a railway, watch the tracks as you travel. Although the road will often follow the natural ground closely, the tracks will maintain a much more consistent elevation with only gradual changes in slope.</p>
<p>The number of tracks is another essential consideration in railway design. A single track is less expensive to build and maintain than two but has some disadvantages. Most important, trains traveling in opposite directions must have a way to pass each <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_117" title="117"/>other. A <span class="SmallCaps">siding</span> (or <em>passing loop</em>) is a short section of parallel track that allows trains to pass. The capacity of a single-track railroad depends on the number of these sidings. Careful scheduling can maximize the use of the single track, but two or more tracks dramatically increase the railway’s capacity and reliability.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Although modern railroads mostly use continuously welded rails, occasional breaks between long sections are still required. This is especially true at bridges or <em>viaduct</em> structures that expand and contract at different rates than the tracks above. At these intermittent locations where thermal movement in the rails is unrestrained, the joints must have room for significant deviations in length. Using a butt joint between rail sections would create a major discontinuity for passengers and rolling stock. Instead, <em>expansion joints</em> on rails (sometimes called <em>breather switches</em>) use diagonal tapers. This oblique joint allows train wheels to transition smoothly from one section of rail to another while still leaving enough room for thermal movement.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c05-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_119" title="119"/>Switches and Signals</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Confining trains to their tracks might seem to eliminate the challenge of managing traffic flow. After all, there aren’t many opportunities for decision-making when you can move in only one of two directions. However, efficient use of a railroad requires that many trains must share the same tracks. Allowing trains to interact and navigate around each other requires some ingenuity precisely because railways are so constrained to a single dimension.</p>
<p>One significant challenge to managing railway traffic is the considerable distance required to stop a fully loaded train. Unlike motor vehicles whose drivers see and respond to hazards in real time, a train can take more than a mile to reach a complete stop. If a train operator can see an obstruction on the tracks while traveling at full speed, it is already too late. Trains sharing a railway need to maintain enough distance between each other to stop as required without the potential for collision, and they need to keep this distance without relying on the vision of the train crews.</p>
<p>Over the years, many solutions to multi-train traffic management have been used. The earliest method was simply to establish a timetable of when and where each train should be at any time of the day. The apparent limitation of this system is the possibility of a train breaking down or encountering a problem that prevents it from following the schedule. In the best case, a breakdown would delay all the other trains on the line, and in the worst case, it could lead to a crash. Most modern railway traffic control schemes are instead based on a block system. The tracks are subdivided into segments (called <span class="SmallCaps">blocks</span>), and trains are prevented from entering any specific block until it is free from obstructions. For non-signalized railways, traffic can be managed through <em>warrants</em>. A dispatcher provides a standardized authorization to the crew for specific train movements on the main tracks. However, most heavily trafficked lines use <span class="SmallCaps">signals</span> as the primary means of controlling traffic between blocks.</p>
<p>Just like a traffic signal on a roadway (as discussed in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 3">Chapter 3</span>), railway signals tell the train operator when it’s safe to proceed. In fact, many railway signals use combinations of lights to provide further information about the routes and speed limits ahead. Even in North America, many railways use different standards, so interpreting the meaning of their signals can take some work. The simplest signals are those between blocks, which usually have a single <span class="SmallCaps">signal head</span> with three lights—green, yellow, and red—similar to those used at roadway intersections. A green light means the following blocks are clear and the train can continue at full speed. Yellow indicates that the next block is clear, but the one after is obstructed, and the next signal will indicate stop. A red light means the next block is occupied, and the train cannot proceed.</p>
<p>Some signals are controlled by a dispatcher, but many operate automatically <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_120" title="120"/>using <em>track circuits</em>. In the most basic configurations, a low-voltage electric current is introduced into the rails at one end of the block. At the other end, a relay measures the current to control the nearby signals. When a train enters a block, the wheels and axles create a conductive path between the rails, shorting the circuit and de-energizing the relay. <span class="SmallCaps">Insulating joints</span> are installed between each track block to ensure that adjacent signals aren’t inadvertently triggered. A nonconductive material is used to attach two sections of rail while keeping them electrically isolated. Modern track circuits can even provide information about the location and velocity of each train. The relays, electronics, and batteries used to control the signals are usually hidden inside enclosures called <span class="SmallCaps">signal bungalows</span>.</p>
<p>Beyond block signals, multiple signal heads and light combinations carrying various meanings add even more complexity. The busiest companies use centralized traffic control offices that operate like air traffic controllers to coordinate the schedules and routing so that conflicts are avoided. Modern traffic systems provide warnings and information inside the cab of each train, reducing the possibility of human error. In addition, the most sophisticated signal systems allow trains to communicate their positions to each other so the blocks can travel along with the train, rather than being static stretches of track on a map.</p>
<p>Another vital element of railway traffic management is movement between tracks. Trains often need to pass one another, divert to destinations off the main line, and swap cars and compartments in rail yards. Without a way to transition between railways, trains would be forever stuck on a single track, making these tasks impossible. <span class="SmallCaps">Switches</span> (also known as <em>turnouts</em>) provide the means for trains to change tracks. The most basic type of switch uses two flexible tapered rails called <span class="SmallCaps">points</span>. The train wheels are guided in one of two directions, depending on which of the two points is contacting the nonmoving <span class="SmallCaps">stock rail</span>. A <span class="SmallCaps">connecting rod</span> below the track attaches the points to a mechanism that selects the train direction. Sometimes a <span class="SmallCaps">switchstand</span> with a lever that a rail employee must throw manually controls the switch. Alternatively, a dispatcher may control the switch remotely using an electromechanical <em>switch machine</em>.</p>
<p>Once past the points, the train wheels navigate onto one of the two tracks. However, before reaching the main track, the left wheel must cross the right rail of the opposite track or vice versa. These crossings require a gap in the rail through which the wheel flanges can pass, a task accomplished with a <span class="SmallCaps">frog</span>. The crossing wheel is handed off from one of the <span class="SmallCaps">closure rails</span> to the frog<span class="SmallCaps"> </span>as the flange passes through the gap. Adjacent to the frog are <span class="SmallCaps">guard rails</span>. These run parallel to the main rails to keep wheels in alignment and protect against derailment. You can also see guard rails used on sharp curves and along bridges.</p>
<p>When two tracks cross each other without a connection between, a <span class="SmallCaps">diamond</span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_121" title="121"/>is installed. These crossings consist of four frogs to allow each wheel to traverse both rails of the intersecting tracks. Both switches and diamonds receive a significant amount of wear and tear from regular train traffic. When they cross over gaps and joints, wheels generate massive impact forces that can damage the rolling stock and the railway itself. As a result, switches and crossings receive extra attention from inspectors to reduce the likelihood of a failure that could lead to a derailment.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Although rail transportation remains a vital way to move goods and people worldwide, the heyday of rail construction has passed. Over time, consolidation of the rail transport industry and the increased efficiency of other modes of travel have led to the closing of railways in many countries. Luckily, with their gentle slopes, connections to city centers, and passage through beautiful countryside, unused rail corridors are ideal for an alternate use: walking and biking. <em>Rail</em><em> </em><em>trails</em> convert abandoned lines into long multiuse paths, and they can be found around the world. The longest rail trails extend for hundreds of miles with connections to neighborhoods, parks, stores, restaurants, and even campsites.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c05-0004"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_123" title="123"/>Grade Crossings</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Railroads stretch vast distances across areas completely unpopulated by people, but between those empty stretches are the city centers they connect. The closer a railroad gets to a populated place, the more conflicts with other infrastructure it encounters. Most important, railroads are an impediment to the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Some roads and railways use bridges to cross each other without interruption, but many intersect at the same level. These <span class="SmallCaps">grade crossings</span> are where the average person is most likely to encounter a railway. Trains moving at full speed cannot stop within the sight distance of an operator, and they can’t swerve to avoid a hazard either. For those reasons, they always have the right of way at crossings. Pedestrians and motor vehicles must stop and wait for trains to pass, so grade crossings include many safety features to decrease the potential for dangerous collisions.</p>
<p>In many countries, grade crossings are assigned an identifier, called the <span class="SmallCaps">grade crossing number</span>, to simplify accident and malfunction reporting. Modern railway companies (and their regulators) are dedicated to public safety and respond quickly to reports of problems. The safety features at grade crossings are generally divided into two categories: passive and active. <em>Passive warning devices</em> are those that do not change when a train is approaching. They include a stop or yield sign and a <span class="SmallCaps">crossbuck</span>, the international symbol for a railway crossing that consists of two slats in an X formation. When more than one rail is present, a supplementary plate states the number of tracks at the intersection. A crossbuck is often included as a <span class="SmallCaps">pavement marking</span> to make sure drivers know the tracks are coming up. Many low-traffic grade crossings use only passive safety features. It is the driver’s responsibility to heed these warnings, look out for trains, and proceed only when it is safe to do so.</p>
<p><em>Active warning devices</em> provide a visual or audible notice that a train is approaching. They are usually triggered by a track circuit of the same kind used in automatic block signaling (described in the previous section). Like railway signals, the relays, electronics, and batteries that control the automatic warning devices at grade crossings are hidden inside enclosures, often called <span class="SmallCaps">signal bungalows</span>. When a train approaches the intersection, a pair of red <span class="SmallCaps">warning lights</span> begins to flash, letting motorists know they need to stop. If the roadway has multiple lanes, the crossing may include a second pair of warning lights mounted overhead on a <span class="SmallCaps">cantilever support</span>. Mechanical or electronic <span class="SmallCaps">crossing bells</span> also provide an audible warning at the crossing for pedestrians or bicyclists who may not see the flashing lights.</p>
<p>In addition to lights and bells, many grade crossings include <span class="SmallCaps">gates</span> that drop across the oncoming lanes when a train crosses the roadway. The gates are equipped with reflective tape and lights <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_124" title="124"/>to make them more conspicuous, even at night. Many intersections include a central <span class="SmallCaps">median</span> to discourage drivers from going around the gate. At the highest-risk crossings, <span class="SmallCaps">exit gates</span> are often installed for the same reason. They operate on a delay to avoid trapping a vehicle on the tracks. Most grade crossing gates are designed to provide a visual warning, but they aren’t strong enough to hold back an errant vehicle. At crossings of high-speed trains, a more robust <em>barrier gate</em> may be installed.</p>
<p>One challenge with grade crossings happens in urban areas where signalized intersections are present near the railway. Red lights form a <em>queue</em> of vehicles that can back up across the tracks. You should never proceed across a railway until you know it’s clear on the other side. Still, drivers queueing at a traffic signal often misjudge the available space and find themselves inadvertently stopped right on top of the tracks. <span class="SmallCaps">Traffic signals</span> at busy intersections near grade crossings are usually coordinated with automatic warning devices. When a train is approaching, the signal goes green to clear the queue blocking the tracks.</p>
<p>A key consideration in the design of grade crossings is the <em>warning time</em> between the activation of devices and the train’s arrival at the intersection. Engineers need to provide enough time for vehicles to clear the tracks or stop, but not so much that impatient motorists assume the devices are malfunctioning and try to bypass the gates. People are naturally distrustful of automatic equipment, and that wariness is only reinforced when signals take too long to operate or interrupt a journey for no good reason. Engineers consider the volume and types of traffic, the proximity of signalized intersections, the number of tracks, and many other factors to strike a careful balance. The most sophisticated track circuits can estimate the speed of a train to make sure that warning times aren’t too long and can even cancel the warning if a train stops before it reaches the crossing.</p>
<p>Automatic warning devices are designed to operate on the failsafe principle. When a malfunction or loss of power occurs, the device reverts to the safest condition (which is to assume a train is approaching). If power is lost, most devices have batteries to power the flashing lights and bells. <span class="SmallCaps">Counterweights</span> are carefully adjusted so that the gates will automatically fall when the electricity isn’t present to hold them up. Failsafe operation ensures that motor vehicles won’t inadvertently cross the tracks if there’s a problem with the warning devices.</p>
<p>In addition to the crossing warning devices, locomotives provide their own warnings, including <span class="SmallCaps">bells,</span> bright <span class="SmallCaps">headlights</span>, and smaller flashing<span class="SmallCaps"> ditch lights</span>. Most noticeably, they sound a blaring <span class="SmallCaps">horn</span> ahead of each grade crossing. The standard pattern is two long blasts, one short blast, and one final long blast. This sequence is either prolonged or repeated until the train reaches the crossing. If you look closely, you can sometimes see a <span class="SmallCaps">whistle post</span> beside the tracks: a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_125" title="125"/>short sign placed ahead of a grade crossing to notify the train operator when to begin sounding the horn. In the United States, they usually consist of a small white marker with a capital W.</p>
<p>With so many types of warnings, it might seem that people would notice whether a train was coming before crossing railroad tracks, but hundreds of fatal collisions between trains and motor vehicles happen at grade crossings every year around the world. If you’re driving and see the crossbuck, make sure to stop, listen, and look both ways before crossing the tracks.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">One aspect of railroads that is difficult to escape is the noise, especially at grade crossings where each passing train sounds its deafening horn. Excessive noise from trains can be harmful to human health by increasing stress, disrupting sleep, and even causing long-term hearing loss. Trains often pass through densely populated areas where horns can be particularly disruptive. To mitigate this nuisance, many governments have created <em>quiet zones</em>, stretches of track where trains do not sound their horn ahead of grade crossings. Extra safety measures are usually installed to make up for the loss of this important audible warning, including signs reminding motorists to look out for trains. Of course, horns must still be used to warn animals, vehicles, or people on the tracks, but quiet zones otherwise make it much more peaceful to live or work adjacent to a railway.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c05-0005"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_127" title="127"/>Electrified Railways</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Nearly all modern trains run on electric power. Even the large diesel engines in freight locomotives connect to an electric generator that powers <em>traction motors</em> to pull the train. Electric motors eliminate the need for massive and complex transmission systems that would otherwise be required to drive the wheels directly from an engine. With the relative simplicity of delivering electricity across long distances, it is natural to wonder why an onboard engine is necessary at all. Indeed, many railways are electrified, meaning they provide electric power for propulsion directly to the train.</p>
<p>Electrifying a railway has many advantages. First, trains don’t have to carry the weight of large engines and the enormous volume of fuel they require. They are generally faster and more efficient than their diesel counterparts. Removing the engine also removes its exhaust, improving air quality. This feature is particularly important for trains that run through tunnels or subway systems where engine fumes could concentrate to dangerous levels. Nearly all rapid transit systems use electric railways. Finally, electric trains are capable of regenerating electricity upon braking. Instead of converting the kinetic energy into wasted heat with brakes, the electric motors can act as generators, transforming it back into electricity that other trains on the railway can use. On rapid transit, where trains decelerate quickly, <em>regenerative energy</em> comes in short bursts, reducing its usefulness to other trains. However, in areas with many hills, it can be a boon. In an ideal situation, much of the energy a train uses to climb a large hill can be returned to the system as it descends to be used by other trains.</p>
<p>There are numerous electric railway standards around the world, many of which have not changed for more than 100 years. Many systems use direct current because it’s easy to change the speed of a DC motor with simple equipment in the cab. However, low-voltage direct current cannot travel far in conductors without significant losses, so most DC railways require regularly spaced substations to convert grid power to direct current along the length of the track. Alternating current can be delivered at a higher voltage and stepped down inside a train. However, it is more dangerous and requires extra equipment onboard the locomotive to convert AC for traction motors.</p>
<p>The infrastructure required to deliver power to moving trains can be quite elaborate, and its cost is the key reason that longer and lower-volume railways are rarely electrified. There are two primary ways to provide electric power to a train: a third rail or an overhead line. <span class="SmallCaps">Third rail</span> systems use an energized conductor that runs along the track parallel to the main rails. The energized rail sits atop <span class="SmallCaps">insulators</span> to keep it isolated from the ground. Trains are equipped with <span class="SmallCaps">shoes</span> that slide along the third rail to collect traction power. It’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_128" title="128"/>a simple and effective system, but it does create a shock hazard for people or animals near the railway. Strict control of the right of way is required for safety, including fences and warning signs. Many third rails are equipped with <span class="SmallCaps">protective covers</span> to minimize the chance of injury to railway personnel and to keep rain, snow, and ice off the surface. </p>
<p>The other option for delivering electricity to trains is overhead. Overhead lines are safer, and thus, most high-voltage systems are installed above the tracks. In this setup, a current collector sits atop the train. A few different devices can perform this task, but most modern trains employ a <span class="SmallCaps">pantograph</span>. They use spring-loaded arms to maintain contact between a replaceable graphite shoe and the overhead conductor. It’s a simple concept but complex in practice. Take a look at standard overhead electric or utility lines, and you’ll notice the challenge right away. They sag in the middle of the span. Maintaining contact with such large deviations in height between each support at high speeds would be impossible, so overhead railway power systems use a pair of lines to ensure reliable transfer of electricity to the train. The top wire, called the <span class="SmallCaps">messenger wire</span>, is only for support. The curved shape it takes between poles is called a <em>catenary</em>, so that name is often used to describe the whole system. From the messenger wire, vertical supports called <span class="SmallCaps">drops</span> connect the <span class="SmallCaps">contact wire</span> below, and that is the line on which the pantograph rides.</p>
<p>The two-wire system allows the contact wire to be held at a consistent height along the tracks, making it possible for a pantograph to slide along it at rapid speeds. Both wires are energized to carry the traction current, and they are often kept under tension with <span class="SmallCaps">weights </span>suspended on <span class="SmallCaps">pulleys</span> on either side of the lines. This tension takes up slack to reduce the sag of the lines as they expand and contract from temperature changes. The tension also increases the speed of waves that travel along the wires. It makes the vibrations smaller and higher-frequency (just like a guitar string) to minimize bouncing, which can create electric arcs each time the contact wire and pantograph separate. The contact wire is held in a horizontal zig-zag pattern with <span class="SmallCaps">registration arms</span> so that the pantograph’s shoe wears evenly across its width.</p>
<p>An electric circuit requires a loop, so electrified railways need a second conductor to complete the connection. In most electrified railways, return current travels in the steel <span class="SmallCaps">running rails</span> on which the wheels roll. With a good connection to the earth, the voltage on the rails will stay low enough to avoid presenting a danger to people and animals. However, return currents create several engineering challenges. For one, the rails are where signal circuits typically travel. If the rails are carrying return current, the small track circuit signals get overwhelmed. Electrified railways often use AC track circuits to control the signals. Relays used to detect trains can be designed with filters to pick <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_129" title="129"/>up specific frequencies and ignore the traction current in the rail.</p>
<p>Another major issue with using rails in contact with the ground as a return path is stray current. The flow of electricity can take unintended deviations into nearby pipelines, tunnel linings, utility ducts, and other metallic structures. These stray currents can lead to rapid corrosion if not mitigated. Some railways use a fourth rail or additional overhead conductor to provide a return path that is less likely to stray into nearby metallic objects.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">In addition to stray current, AC systems with overhead conductors create a large loop when the return current travels through the rails. These loops generate electromagnetic fields that can induce noise and voltage on communication lines running parallel to the tracks, including those carrying signal information. You never want a red light inadvertently turning green from electrical noise! So, booster transformers are often installed at regular intervals to force the return current into overhead lines, reducing the size of the loops and canceling much of the potential interference.</p>

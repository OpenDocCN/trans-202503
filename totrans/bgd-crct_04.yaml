- en: This circuit stays quiet when it’s in a dark place, such as in a cookie jar
    with the lid on. But once the lid comes off and lets light inside, the circuit
    sounds an alarm that should scare off any cookie thieves.

- en: The circuit uses a *light-dependent resistor (LDR)* to detect light. Its resistance
    changes when it detects more or less light. The more light the LDR detects, the
    lower the resistance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The LDR and R2 make up a *voltage divider*, which controls the amount of input
    voltage at the base of the transistor, switching the transistor off or on depending
    on how much light is detected.

- en: The buzzer will sound only if current is flowing through it, which can happen
    only if there is a path from the battery’s positive terminal to its negative terminal.
    This means the alarm will sound only if the transistor is turned “on” so that
    current can flow from the battery’s positive terminal through the buzzer, then
    from the transistor’s collector to its emitter, and finally back into the battery’s
    negative terminal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you saw in [Project 2](ch02.xhtml#ch02), for a transistor to be turned “on,”
    current needs to flow from its base to its emitter. This happens only when the
    voltage between the base and emitter is about 0.7 V. When the voltage is much
    less than 0.7 V, no current flows through the base, and emitter and the transistor
    is off.

- en: In the circuit diagram in [Figure 3-1](ch03.xhtml#ch03fig1), you can see that
    the voltage from the base to the emitter is equivalent to the voltage across R2.

- en: In this case, V[out] equals about 0.8 V. This is more than the 0.7 V required
    for current to flow from the base to the emitter, so the transistor turns “on,”
    allowing current to flow through the buzzer, collector, and emitter and sounding
    the alarm.

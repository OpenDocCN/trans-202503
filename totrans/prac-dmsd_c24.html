			<p class="ChapterIntro">In this fourth and final part of the book, we’ll end on a topic that many other survivalist publications begin with: actively defending yourself, your loved ones, and the property you own.</p>
			<p>
				The reason I decided to break ranks and save this matter  for later is simple: despite what we pick up from 24-hour news and the grainy CCTV footage occasionally shared on YouTube or Facebook, active self-defense isn’t a common need. Events such as mass shootings or kidnappings are rare. As for everyday crime, as noted in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 10">Chapter 10</span>, most burglaries happen when the occupants are away—and in such situations, a gun kept under the pillow isn’t of much use, except as an easy picking for whoever ransacks your home.</p>
			<p>
				On the streets, many unwelcome encounters start off ambiguously and don’t escalate to deadly force. In such circumstances, being too eager to pull out a knife or a firearm to make a person back off could land you in legal trouble; even the use of pepper spray may count as assault. Naturally, violent confrontations can and do happen, and when a shadowy figure is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_196" title="196"/>closing in on you in a dark and empty parking lot, a weapon within reach can be worth the peace of mind. It’s just that the ultra-militaristic focus of many survivalist scholars goes too far.</p>
			<p>
				It also bears repeating that although the right to fight for your life is enshrined in most legal systems around the world, the realities of self-defense can be murky. This is especially true in places where the letter of the law no longer aligns with prevailing social attitudes. Take California, for example: the bestselling primer on the state’s labyrinthine gun regulations is the aptly titled <em>California Gun Laws</em>, a 560-page opus by C. D. Michel and Matthew D. Cubeiro (Coldaw Publishing, 2020). The book is updated every single year, and on quite a few key questions, it simply states that the regulations are indecipherable and that it’s anyone’s guess as to how they might be interpreted by the prosecutors or the courts. In London, meanwhile, where guns are out of reach for most folks, the government would like a word about your pocket knife: in a 2018 tweet, the mayor said that there is “never a reason to carry a knife” and that those who do “will feel the full force of the law.”<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-1" id="c24-noteref-1">1</a></sup></p>
			<p>Once again, that’s not to say that actively defending oneself is a folly and that nothing but trouble awaits those who try. In certain times and places, having options is worth the price. It’s just that boisterous online slogans (say, “Better judged by twelve than carried by six”) are best set aside in favor of a measured evaluation of the trade-offs. At the same time, I urge equal caution against the politically tinged misinformation meant to dissuade you from considering the full spectrum of choices you might have.</p>
			<p>In the United States, the gun debate is a particular minefield of bad-faith arguments and sketchy science. We can disagree about policy, but from an individualistic point of view, the math seems simple: in a society where firearms are ubiquitous and commonly available to criminals, refusing to own a gun doesn’t appear to confer an obvious advantage in a confrontation with a perp. Yet, the allure of this argument is precisely what makes it anathema to some proponents of stricter gun control—and so, they strive to cast firearms not as normal tools, but as a unique menace that, if invited into your home, inevitably puts you in harm’s way. The argument is commonly backed by studies that count fragmentary reports of lawful self-defense killings, and then contrast them with comprehensive medical statistics of firearm-related suicides, accidental injuries, or even all gun homicides. The conclusion is simple: if you have a gun, you’re supposedly an order of magnitude more likely to harm yourself than save a loved one with it.</p>
			<p>
				Of course, that comparison is apples to oranges. For one, although robust statistics on defensive gun uses in the United States are hard to come by, both sides contend the incidents probably exceed 100,000 a year—and most don’t involve firing a single shot, let alone killing anyone.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-2" id="c24-noteref-2">2</a></sup> In other words, lawful killings are an intentionally terrible proxy for “beneficial” outcomes of gun ownership.</p>
			<p>
				The other side of the equation is lopsided too, although in a less obvious way. To illustrate the problem, let’s go with the somber example of suicides as a risk attributed to firearms. In countries with easy access to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_197" title="197"/>them, guns can be a common choice for suicidal individuals, and in the United States, they account for about 24,000 out of 47,500 annual deaths.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-3" id="c24-noteref-3">3</a></sup> No rational person would disagree that removing firearms would cause <em>firearm</em> suicides to plummet. What doesn’t necessarily follow, yet what is implied in most analyses, is that doing so would also drastically reduce <em>total</em> suicides—in other words, that guns are an important causative factor, not just an implement of choice.</p>
			<p>
				This question is more complex than intuition may dictate. Consider that for many decades, the US per capita suicide rate trailed that of many developed countries with strict gun regimes, including much of Europe.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-4" id="c24-noteref-4">4</a></sup> It’s true that the US rate started climbing rapidly around the time of the housing crisis of 2007 to 2009, and continues its upward trajectory to this day,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-5" id="c24-noteref-5">5</a></sup> but this particular trend is more readily explained by economic shifts than by the proliferation of guns. Lastly, while the recent increases have put the United States ahead of some of its wealthy peers, its overall suicide rate is still in the same ballpark as that of Finland, Belgium, Latvia, or Japan.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-6" id="c24-noteref-6">6</a></sup></p>
			<p>In the end, knives, nunchucks, pepper spray, and firearms should be thought of as dangerous tools. Much like the car in your garage or the drugs in your medicine cabinet, they can cause terrible accidents and must be treated with care. Nothing good comes of approaching such tools with unconditional love—or with irrational fear—but when handled in a balanced way, a weapon can be a small building block of a comprehensive preparedness plan.</p>

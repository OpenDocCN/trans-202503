    the electronics. Although the subject matter is vast and can be highly technical,
    with some basic information, almost anyone can get electricity to work for them.
    Luckily for you, I am here to provide that information. All that is required is
    patience and a willingness to learn. Some of this information might not make sense
    right away, and that is okay. As you actually begin to build some bots, everything
    will start to become clear.

    using a battery, remember that electrical current always flows between a voltage
    source and ground. You’ve likely noticed that batteries have a plus (positive)
    side and a minus (negative) side. By tradition, the minus side of the battery
    is the ground, and the plus side is the positive voltage.

    charge in a circuit) and *voltage* (the force by which the charge is flowing through
    the circuit). If you think of a circuit like a garden hose, the current is how
    much water is flowing through it, and the voltage is the force by which the water
    is being pushed through.'

    1.5 V of electricity. The difference between these batteries is not how much voltage
    they can provide but how much current they can provide. The larger the battery,
    the more current it can provide and the longer it will provide electricity.

    them to power a circuit that uses a voltage higher than 1.5 V. The answer is simple:
    you connect the batteries *in series* to achieve higher voltages. This means placing
    the batteries end to end, where the positive side of one touches the ground side
    of the next. The voltage of all the batteries in the series is added together,
    so by connecting four 1.5 V batteries end to end, you can easily create a 6 V
    power source.'

    is material that easily lets electricity flow. For all the robot projects, you’ll
    be using insulated wire. An *insulator* is material that prevents the flow of
    electricity across it. By using an insulated wire with a conductive core, you
    can route electricity to the places it needs to go, without worrying about the
    wires touching and making incorrect connections.

    Anything less may be challenging to work with, and anything more may expose too
    much wire and result in crossed connections.

    and the *throw* is a potential output point.

    but a switch with more than one throw can have different outputs, depending on
    how it is toggled. For instance, a *single-pole double-throw (SPDT**)* switch
    has a single pole to which a common connection is attached, but it has a double
    throw that allows it to toggle between two different output connections. When
    switched one way, it outputs toward its *normally closed* *(NC)* connection, and
    when toggled the opposite way, it routes electricity through its *normally open*
    *(NO)* connection.

    and each one toggles through two separate electrical outputs.

    of an electromagnet is powered up, the switch inside the relay is engaged, and
    when power is released, the switch inside the relay goes back to its normal state.
    In Chapters 13 and 14, you’ll use relays to make some advanced circuits.

    way, twice as much voltage is required to power two motors at normal speed if
    they’re connected in series.

    are wired side by side with electricity passing through both at once in order
    to get to ground. In this arrangement, they both spin at normal speed at their
    normal voltage, but they now are drawing double the amount of current from the
    batteries. This configuration is better because a battery pack can typically provide
    more current, but it can’t provide more voltage.

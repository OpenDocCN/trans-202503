<p class="ChapterIntro">Before we can phish Strat Jumbo, we need to learn more about the company. Weâ€™ll check out its user-facing internet presence and dig out some hidden subdomains. A quick Google search reveals that Strat Jumbo Inc. is a London-based company with around 800 employees, mainly backend programmers, spread across 10 countries. This is a company with enough potential targets to ensure a significant return on investment should we conduct a phishing campaign. We can already imagine seductive lures for such a crowd: a new Chrome extension, a corporate poll on C# versus Java, beta access to a new feature, and so forth.</p>

    THE PINS ON THE ARDUINO UNO, THEIR TECHNICAL NAMES, AND THEIR FUNCTIONS. THE PINS
    ARE EXPLAINED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE PROJECTS IN WHICH THEY’RE USED, SO THE INFORMATION
    HERE WILL PROBABLY MAKE MORE SENSE ONCE YOU’VE BUILT A FEW PROJECTS.**'

    (TX) transistor-transistor logic (TTL) serial data. We use the TX pin in the rocket
    launcher in [Project 17](ch17.xhtml#ch17).'

- en: '**External interrupts: 2 and 3** These pins can be configured to trigger an
    interrupt on a low value, a *rising* or *falling edge* (a signal going from low
    to high or high to low, respectively), or a change in value. An *interrupt* is
    a signal that tells the Arduino to stop and carry out another function when the
    pins have detected an external event, such a pushbutton being pressed.'

- en: '**PWM: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11** These pins can be used with pulse width modulation
    through the `analogWrite()` function. There’s more information on this in [Project
    2](ch02.xhtml#ch02).'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**SPI: 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), 13 (SCK)** These pins support SPI communication
    using the SPI library and are used a number of times in this book. We use SPI
    communication for the electronic die in [Project 16](ch16.xhtml#ch16) so that
    the Arduino can send and receive data from the shift register used to control
    the seven-segment LED.'

- en: '**LED: 13** There is a built-in LED connected to digital pin 13\. When the
    pin is `HIGH`, the LED is on; when the pin is `LOW`, it’s off. The built-in LED
    on pin 13 is used to show when the onboard ATmega328p bootloader is running, usually
    when the Arduino is starting up.'

- en: '**AREF** This is the reference voltage for the analog inputs; it’s used with
    `analogReference()`. We can input from 0 to 5V, so if your sensor requires a lower
    voltage than 5V, you can use this pin to increase the resolution for a more accurate
    reading.'

    using the Wire library. This is used to control and communicate with an I2C device,
    such as a serial LCD screen, using only two wires.'

- en: The book uses a layflat binding, in which the pages are bound together with
    a cold-set, flexible glue and the first and last pages of the resulting book block
    are attached to the cover. The cover is not actually glued to the book’s spine,
    and when open, the book lies flat and the spine doesn’t crack.

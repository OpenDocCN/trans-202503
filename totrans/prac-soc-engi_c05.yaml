    However, you don’t always need fancy tools to get the information you need. Often,
    looking at social media platforms is enough. In this chapter, we’ll discuss how
    some of the most innocent posts on the internet can be weaponized. You’ll learn
    how to gather OSINT from these platforms, as well as a few platforms that aren’t
    social media, but are just as impactful. You’ll read a company’s public documents
    and learn to take automatic screenshots to document your findings.

    we target. While some organizations have *clean desk policies* that require employees
    to remove sensitive information from their desks when they’re on break, at lunch,
    or out of the office, many of those policies do not include photos taken on personal
    devices. As a result, people post publicly about whatever concerns or excites
    them, whether it be at home or at work. This gives OSINT investigators an all-access
    tour of an organization’s facilities, and often lets us see more than we would

    of documents and forms to maintain compliance. These documents prove to the SEC
    that all information being reported is truthful and that the company is not breaking
    any laws. Because these documents are available to the public, they’re a great
    source of OSINT.

    annual report. It provides an overview of how the company is doing financially,
    the executive team, the board of directors, any problems they had over the past
    year, and risks that concern them. The SEC mandates that companies file these
    forms within 90 days of the end of their fiscal year, so publication dates may
    vary.

    publicly available resources. The information gathered in this chapter is a good
    foundation on which to build a social engineering attack. While we should weaponize
    only the information we need, it is important to talk about what we found but
    didn’t use in the report that we send our clients. After all, we are trying to
    help our client companies become more secure. We don’t just want to gain access,
    beat our chests, and then repeat the exercise the next time.

    of OSINT is analyzing data and figuring out ways to exploit it. To some, OSINT
    is just as much as a mode of thought as it is a technical capability. You do not
    have to be an elite hacker (in the technical sense) to be good, great, or even
    elite at OSINT. The same goes for social engineering.

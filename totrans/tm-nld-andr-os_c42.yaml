    and didn’t become the phone that everyone had to have.

- en: The reviews shared the opinion that it was . . . interesting. The hardware wasn’t
    awful, although the screen was quite small. It didn’t support video recording.
    And there were not many must-have applications beyond the pre-installed Google
    apps.

    right on the edge of good but was a bit lumpy and awkward.”

    excited about it, but in many ways, it was kind of a crappy device. It showed
    a lot of potential. But for somebody to adopt it? It wasn’t exactly flying off
    the shelves.”'

    it can do a lot. If anything . . . it can do almost too much.’ It had a keyboard
    and it had a trackpad and a rollerball and touch. It had everything. All these
    sensors. You got a feeling initially that Android was trying to do everything.
    I remember thinking at the time, What’s going to survive? Is the keyboard and
    the touchscreen going to survive? Is that trackball really going to be the thing?
    There was recognition that this thing was super-powerful, but total uncertainty
    that it might have been a one-off and flopped. It wasn’t clear to people.”'

    . which as a general consumer product, is not the best thing in the world. But
    it was good for the platform since we had to support all of that stuff.” So while
    it might not have created the best consumer experience for a phone,^([1](#c42-footnote-1))
    it paved the way for a myriad of follow-on devices that were able to take advantage
    of the myriad of capabilities that the platform provided.

- en: 'Holiday sales are the biggest time of year for new devices. Dan Egnor remembered
    that first holiday with the G1: “Michael Morrissey [manager of the services team]
    had bad memories of Christmas day spikes [from Danger], and nobody on the team
    being available while things were melting down. So he was like, ‘We’re gonna have
    an on-call coverage that day. We’re gonna have a War Room. Who’s gonna be around?
    Big sacrifice, working Christmas Day. . . . ‘I was like, I’ll do this, sure.’
    And then nothing happened. We had more activations than a typical day, but there
    wasn’t even a particularly large spike.”'

    in real, if not overwhelming, numbers. T-Mobile reported^([2](#c42-footnote-2))
    that it had reached sales of over a million units in the US six months later.
    This was, coincidentally, the number of devices needed in that timeframe to convince
    the Google networking team to not take back its dedicated VIP resource^([3](#c42-footnote-3))
    from the Android services team, which would have caused serious problems for all
    of the Google apps on Android.

- en: The G1 also provided a decent enough experience for people to take Android seriously
    as a platform. Android had finally been released out into the world. People were
    able to use the device and the platform to do what they needed to do, and that
    was good enough for now. Consumers could take Android seriously as a phone, and
    potential partners could take Android seriously as a platform. It allowed manufacturers
    to see that Android was real and that they could use it to build their own devices,
    which would eventually be more interesting and more powerful than that initial
    G1.

    The G1 was good but wasn’t a huge volume driver and didn’t really get that much
    attention outside of the tech industry. But launching it made it real for the
    OEMs: ‘OK these people can actually ship. It’s a real thing. It’s not vaporware.’
    By the time G1 launched, we were already in discussions with all the major OEMs,
    who eventually became our partners.”'

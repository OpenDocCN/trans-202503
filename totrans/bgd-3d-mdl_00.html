<div class="image1"><img src="Images/common.jpg" alt="Images" width="246" height="245"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Humans have always created their own designs, and in the dark times before the rise of computers, engineers used <em>technical drawing</em> to describe three-dimensional objects.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You’ve probably done some basic technical drawing yourself at one time or another. Maybe you made a sketch for a coffee table you were building, or you drew a simple floor plan of your bathroom to show a contractor where you wanted that new whirlpool tub.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In both these cases, the idea is the same: to illustrate something physical as clearly as possible. It’d be inconvenient to come home to find that your contractor had blocked the bathroom door with your new bathtub because your drawing was ambiguous.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec5"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_2"/>Drafting and the Industrial Revolution</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Demands on technical drawing skills exploded in the 18th century, thanks to the Industrial Revolution. The complexity of both machines and product design grew exponentially, and as a result, required more precise instructions for making parts. A rough sketch might have been enough for a carpenter building a table, but steam engines and industrial tools required drawings that were far more detailed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This necessity gave rise to the formal discipline of <em>drafting</em>, the practice of creating technical drawings, like the patent assembly drawing for a steam engine shown in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig1">Figure 1-1</a>. Drafters (also called <em>draftspeople</em>) began creating engineering drawings that removed all ambiguity about their designs. The single most important part of the drafting profession is the ability to create drawings that can be interpreted in only <em>one</em> way. Factories churn out parts by the thousands; imagine having to scrap all of those parts because a machinist misinterpreted the drawing they were working from.</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 1-1: An 1899 patent drawing for a steam engine</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_3"/>Of course, ensuring a single interpretation of a drawing requires a common visual language. This design language evolved and became well-defined over time, as the patent system developed and manufacturers began sharing ideas. It eventually standardized through the work of organizations such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">While each of these standards differs slightly in its specifics (such as what symbols to use), they all accomplish the same thing: defining a visual language for technical drawings that, when used properly, removes all ambiguity. Someone trained in a specific standard can interpret a drawing created to that standard with total objectivity. These standards encompass all aspects of a technical drawing—from what font a dimension should be to the proper line weights and styles to use for different features of a part. Until recently, drafters hand-drew all of these details using a variety of tools to help do the job, like drafting tables (shown in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig2">Figure 1-2</a>), mounted pantographs, and specialized pens, rulers, squares, and curve templates.</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 1-2: A large-format drafting table, with an armature-mounted square</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">By the latter half of the 20th century, drafters’ jobs had become incredibly complex. It wasn’t uncommon for a product to have thousands of individual parts, particularly in the automotive and aerospace industries. Manufacturers needed technical drawings for every one of those parts; they also needed drawings illustrating their assembly and even more drawings for tasks like maintenance and repair.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Every single one of those drawings consumed drafters’ time, even as the demands of the marketplace led to ever more intricate designs. Luckily, as with just about every other profession on the planet, the burgeoning digital age revolutionized drafting.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec6"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_4"/>Replacing Pen and Paper</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Before anyone had even built the first digital computers, manufacturers understood the potential benefits of using computers for engineering. After all, the complex calculations needed for the engineering tasks of the 1940s and 1950s were exactly the kind of problems digital computers would later solve. In 1952, researchers at MIT successfully built a digital <em>numerical control (NC)</em> machine too. This became the first milling machine controlled by a computer and laid the groundwork for future <em>computer-aided design (CAD)</em> systems.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Although the technology advanced rapidly, the early computers had limited graphics displays, storage capacity, and user interfaces. Nevertheless, the engineering world saw CAD’s potential, and any organization with the funds to do so rushed to get in the game. MIT and various automotive and aerospace companies developed proto-CAD systems independently during the ’50s and ’60s. At MIT, for instance, Ivan Sutherland developed software called SKETCHPAD that allowed an operator to draw with a light pen on a CRT monitor. During a 1963 presentation on SKETCHPAD, Sutherland claimed that “for highly repetitive drawings or drawings where accuracy is required, SKETCHPAD is sufficiently faster than conventional techniques to be worthwhile.” (You can read the presentation at <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-574.pdf"><em>https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-574.pdf</em></a>.)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, corporations like General Motors (in partnership with IBM), Ford, Citroën, Renault, Lockheed, Boeing, and Bell worked on commercial CAD software. These early CAD systems, like the one shown in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig3">Figure 1-3</a>, mostly aimed to replace drafting done by hand, and the ability to create (and modify) technical drawings electronically sped up drafting dramatically.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec7"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_5"/>Entering the Third Dimension</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The introduction of affordable personal computers in the ’70s led to the widespread adoption of CAD throughout the various engineering disciplines, including mechanical, electrical, and civil engineering.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The new 3D packages that came with these devices changed the design process altogether. Engineers and designers could now create 3D models of large mechanical assemblies, and they could test and verify designs quickly and efficiently, without any physical manufacturing. When it came time to manufacture parts, designers could use the 3D models to quickly generate technical drawings, or even to program machine tools directly, with <em>computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)</em> software.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">During the ’90s, developers refined 3D CAD to take advantage of increased computing power, until most could run on affordable personal computers. Programs of this era include SolidWorks, Solid Edge, and Autodesk Inventor.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec8"><strong>CAD in the Modern World</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">CAD has continued to evolve in the 21st century. In the field of civil engineering, software like Autodesk Revit gives engineers the ability to model entire buildings, down to the electrical system and HVAC layout. Electrical engineers can design printed circuit boards (PCBs) and schematics with software like KiCAD and Autodesk Eagle, which include circuit simulation tools.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This book is about 3D solid modeling from a mechanical engineering perspective, and in that field, CAD has become indispensable. Throughout my career as a mechanical designer, I spent the vast majority of my day-to-day work creating 3D models. Virtually every modern product you come across was first completely modeled by mechanical engineers, designers, and drafters using software.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Today, a drafter makes digital 3D models of parts and assemblies, then uses those models to create technical drawings. Drafters can generate views of the models from any angle and add dimensions, bills of materials, and other technical information very quickly.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec9"><strong>CAD for Hobbyists</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Until recently, most hobbyists couldn’t afford quality CAD software, which was marketed toward professional engineering teams and priced accordingly. Most professional 3D solid–modeling CAD packages cost thousands of dollars, making them impractical for makers and tinkerers working on hobby projects.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_6"/>That all began to change with the popularity of cheap 3D printers. Suddenly, makers around the world created an immense demand for affordable 3D CAD software. Open source 3D mesh-modelers already existed, but they filled only some of hobbyists’ needs; while great for artistic models, they were cumbersome for mechanical tasks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the past few years, CAD software developers have started to answer hobbyists’ demands for true mechanical, parametric, 3D solid–modeling CAD systems. They started with very basic software, like Autodesk 123D and SketchUp. While these were a step forward (and free), they had serious constraints. Users were mostly limited to working with primitive polygons, and advanced modeling was either very difficult or just plain impossible.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Luckily for the makers and 3D printing enthusiasts of the world, Autodesk released <em>Fusion 360</em>, which is what we’ll be working with throughout this book. <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig4">Figure 1-4</a> shows an example of what is possible with Fusion 360.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Fusion 360 is a fully featured parametric CAD program that has nearly all of the features one would find in costly professional CAD software. When I owned a fabrication business, it was the only CAD program I needed. And, best of all, Fusion 360 is free for noncommercial use.</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 1-4: Fusion 360 lets hobbyists create high-quality 3D models for free.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the following chapters, we’ll cover how to use Fusion 360 to create your own professional-quality CAD models. You’ll learn everything from basic sketching to advanced modeling techniques. By the end of the book, you’ll know everything you need to design complex models for 3D printing and even production manufacturing.</p>&#13;

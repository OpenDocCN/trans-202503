    death comes in a matter of days. This somber biological truth makes hydration
    a pressing, nonnegotiable priority in almost every preparedness plan.

- en: It can be argued that water is never far away. Most human settlements have been
    built on the banks of rivers or other natural water sources, and even if municipal
    pumps or rural wells grind to a halt, relatively little infrastructure is needed
    for water trucks to get on the road. But this sentiment lacks nuance. Nowadays,
    tens of millions of people live in arid regions where water needs to be hauled
    from hundreds of miles away, and even in temperate climates, suburban sprawl puts
    many families far from the nearest river or lake. Some disasters—ranging from
    nuclear accidents to storms that overwhelm sewage treatment plants—can spoil surface
    water too. As for water trucks, their ability to reach all families in need depends
    on the condition of area roads and bridges, both of which can be rendered impassable
    by earthquakes and other natural cataclysms.

    72 hours is strongly recommended—not just by wacky doomsayers on the internet,
    but by most authorities. In the United States, this guidance comes from both FEMA
    and many local governments.^([1](b02.xhtml#c15-endnote-1)) Water is cheap and
    shelf-stable, so there’s little reason not to heed their advice. On the flip side,
    because it’s a bulky and heavy good, a principled examination of our needs is
    of essence to avoid coming up short or wasting precious space.

    per day is the safe minimum for survival, provided that exertion and perspiration
    are kept in check. For comfort, most people settle for around 1.5 to 2 quarts
    a day.^([2](b02.xhtml#c15-endnote-2)) That said, under extreme conditions, such
    as for soldiers involved in strenuous physical labor in desert climates, the required
    daily intake may increase quite dramatically, all the way to a gallon or two.^([3](b02.xhtml#c15-endnote-3))

- en: Of course, this statistic doesn’t tell the full story. The average person in
    the United States uses about 80 to 100 gallons per day—most of it not for drinking,
    but for other domestic needs.^([4](b02.xhtml#c15-endnote-4)) Some water uses are
    discretionary; long showers, dishwashing, or watering the lawn can easily be curtailed
    for a couple of days or weeks, for example. But the most water-intensive activity
    around the home is flushing the toilet, and giving that up is a much tougher sell.
    Less dignified sanitation options, such as bagging waste or digging out a latrine,
    may be integrated into some emergency plans—more about that in Chapter 17—but
    such solutions don’t work everywhere or might not be sustainable in the long haul.

- en: For short-term outages that last a day or two, most household uses can be put
    on hold, and hydration can remain the only priority. Under such assumptions, storing
    about 2 quarts per person per day might be a defensible choice, but this leaves
    little room for error. A child or a pet with a hygiene accident, a nasty heat
    wave, or an unexpected guest could throw a wrench in the works. With this in mind,
    I would aim a bit higher, and store about a gallon per household member per day;
    this happens to be the quantity recommended by FEMA too.

- en: When considering longer-term disasters—those that span a week or longer—sanitation,
    hygiene, laundry, and cooking can no longer be ignored, although you can manage
    your water use through careful planning. Cooking-related waste can be minimized
    by avoiding pasta and other water-intensive meals, for instance, while the frequency
    of laundry can be reduced with a small stash of antiperspirant, wet wipes, and
    clean undergarments reserved for the dark days. That said, even with such measures
    in place, it’s safer to budget perhaps two to three gallons per day when preparing
    for the longer haul.

- en: How many days’ worth of water you should actually keep on hand varies based
    on where you live. A generous margin of safety is wise in hot and dry regions
    that get minimal rainfall during the summer months. For example, a resident of
    Los Angeles or Las Vegas may be best served by a water plan that gets them through
    two to three weeks; such a prolonged outage is unlikely, but the stakes are extremely
    high. On the flip side, a far more relaxed approach can be taken in regions less
    prone to drought; in the Northeast, around five to seven days might be a sensible
    baseline for most. A larger stockpile of water can have some utility, but the
    returns are diminishing, so you should carefully consider the trade-offs.

    200 pounds and takes up roughly 4 cubic feet—a rather imposing presence in any
    bedroom closet or kitchen cabinet. It follows that in many urban and suburban
    homes, your available space will dictate your approach to water storage. In some
    situations, you might need to get creative; for example, it might be useful to
    browse for odd-shaped water jugs that can slide neatly under the frame of a raised
    bed.

    a temptation to take the path of least resistance and stock up on one-gallon jugs
    of spring water picked up at the grocery store. At first blush, this is a sensible
    choice, but I can’t in good conscience recommend this approach. The paper-thin
    plastics used to make these containers often develop pinhole leaks at the creases
    and have ruined more than their fair share of cabinets and floors. If cost is
    of the essence, a better option may be to recycle two-liter soda bottles. Because
    such containers must withstand significant pressures, they’re made out of sturdy
    plastics that are unlikely to leak. In contrast, reusing milk or juice jugs is
    not advisable, even if they appear to be made sturdily. The containers are difficult
    to clean properly, and the residues of organic matter can lead to unpleasant smells
    or worse.

    are a good option. Available online and at many outdoor outfitters for about $20
    apiece, these containers are labeled for water and made out of food-safe plastics
    for added peace of mind. For unusually shaped or stackable jugs, it pays to check
    out WaterBrick and Aqua-Tainer products too.

    economical solution. Perhaps the most common choice is a 55-gallon drum, normally
    available for around $70 and taking up about as much room as a typical curbside
    trash bin. On the decidedly extreme side of the spectrum, one can also procure
    pallet-sized 275-gallon industrial IBC totes, or towering 500-gallon storage tanks
    from companies such as Poly-Mart.

    have existing stores of water within reach. For example, water-heating tanks in
    many US homes hold between 50 and 100 gallons and can be drained by opening a
    tap at the bottom of the tank; despite some sediment that may come out at first,
    the water should be safe to drink. Hot tubs, pools, ponds, and rainwater catchment
    systems can provide non-potable water for assorted domestic uses too—although
    drinking it would be a dicey proposition due to a variety of possible contaminants.

    freezing. Ice is about 10 percent less dense than water, so any closed container
    filled to the brim is likely to rupture at the seams. A simple work-around is
    to leave 15 percent of headspace when filling any barrel, can, or jug that may
    be exposed to prolonged temperatures below 32°F.

    in the backyard is of little use. Regardless of how you store the bulk of your

    can be loaded into a vehicle or stashed in a backpack before you hit the road.

    but typically wouldn’t need to exceed three to four days’ worth: a bit more than
    needed to reach a family member, a friend, or a motel of your choice in a place
    less affected by the event. Remember to decide on a destination or a set of possible
    destinations ahead of the time. Driving off into the unknown isn’t a sound plan,
    and neither is pitching a tent in the wilderness in the middle of a snowstorm
    or in freezing rain.'

    such cases, water management involves some difficult and uncomfortable trade-offs.
    It’s usually impractical to carry more than two to four quarts as a part of a
    balanced “bug out” kit, so your plan should be to reach a hospitable location
    within a day. When this is impossible, filtering or chemically treating surface
    water can be an option, but it isn’t an ideal one. Some regions might have a dearth
    of sources of fresh water to begin with, and then, not all pollutants can be reliably
    eliminated by a simple gravity filter or a disinfecting tablet stirred into a
    cup.

    and drinking from a scummy pond, drinking from the pond makes sense. In temperate
    climates, water that looks and smells fine is usually safe, and deadly waterborne
    diseases are few and far between. By far the most common ailment is giardiasis,
    which, while unpleasant, generally resolves on its own. Every year, the media
    dwells on the horror stories of toxic algae or brain-eating amoebas, but serious
    injuries and deaths caused by such pathogens are extremely rare.

- en: Still, even if it’s just giardiasis, a bout of violent diarrhea is not a welcome
    addition to any plan, so water-treatment tools are a worthy addition to every
    basic survival kit. Although many options exist, perhaps the simplest and most
    portable choice is sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) tablets, commonly sold
    under the name of Aquatabs. Their mechanism of action is similar to water chlorination.
    The tablets are shelf-stable, available cheaply in bulk, and take up much less
    space in the backpack than LifeStraw or Katadyn filters and other solutions that
    are sometimes promoted on the internet.

    origins on our planet shrouded in some mystery. Of course, bottled water purchased
    at the grocery store will sometimes have an expiration date printed on the bottle,
    but in the United States, this isn’t driven by legal requirements or health concerns;
    it has to do with the possibility of cosmetic defects with the packaging (such
    as faded inks) and the risk of plastic containers gradually imparting an undesirable

    exposed to sunlight and air will probably sooner or later grow photosynthetic
    algae. Most algae are harmless, but the resulting biomass may eventually begin
    to harbor pathogenic organisms too. For this reason, properly closing containers
    and keeping them out of direct sunlight is important; regular monitoring is also
    a good plan.

- en: Even in the absence of algae, organic contaminants can cause serious problems
    down the road. It’s important to thoroughly rinse your containers and let the
    water run for a while before filling them, especially when using a garden hose
    that harbors all kinds of microflora when not in use. Municipal tap water usually
    doesn’t require any further treatment, but for well water, it may be good to add
    about four to eight drops of regular, unscented chlorine bleach per gallon. Although
    this sounds wacky, it’s a safe and proven method of disinfecting potable water,
    endorsed for emergency use by the Centers for Disease Control.^([6](b02.xhtml#c15-endnote-6))

    issues and other surprises, it’s advisable to rotate it every couple of years,
    or annually if it’s stored in a very warm place (such as the trunk of a car).
    To stay on the safe side, it pays to have some point-of-use treatment options
    too. This can be Aquatabs, a countertop water filter such as Berkey, or a way
    to boil several quarts a day. A repeated treatment with several drops of bleach
    is possible, but bleach isn’t shelf-stable—so setting some aside specifically
    for this purpose and then pulling it out several years later may not have the
    intended result.

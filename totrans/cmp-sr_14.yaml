- en: A *file* is a piece of information saved on your computer. For example, every
    letter, document, photo, song, and video saved on your computer is an individual
    file. Just as you store your bills, CDs, and letters in a certain place at home,
    every file you save on your computer is stored in a folder. The icon for a folder
    looks similar to the manila folders sold at stationery stores, and they have a
    similar purpose. Generally, it’s good practice to store files that have something
    in common together inside a folder. This makes it easier to find the particular
    file you want.

    and folders. You’ll need an easy way to remember *where* you stored your files

    files so that they can easily be found and retrieved.

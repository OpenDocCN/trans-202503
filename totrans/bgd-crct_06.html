<h3 class="h3" id="lev52"><strong>ABOUT THE CIRCUIT</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">One of the first things I wanted to learn in electronics as a kid was how to blink a light. You can do this in one of several ways, but this circuit is probably the easiest way to do it, especially because it requires so few components. In fact, you need only five components, including the resistor and the LED.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The circuit works around an <em>inverter</em>, a component that outputs the opposite voltage of what it takes in. If it gets a <em>high</em> voltage in, it gives a <em>low</em> voltage out, and vice versa. A high voltage is a voltage close to the positive supply voltage (9 V in this case), and a low voltage is a voltage close to 0 V.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_37"/>The output of the inverter (U1) is connected back to the input with a resistor, which causes <em>oscillation</em>, or jumping back and forth between high and low voltage. If the inverter input is high, then its output will be low. You connect that low-voltage output back to the inverter’s input, and because the input is low, the output will be high. That high-voltage output is directed back to the inverter’s input, and so on.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To slow down the oscillation enough to see the LED blink, you use a capacitor on the input of the inverter. A <em>capacitor</em> stores and discharges energy; the charging and discharging of the capacitor in this circuit (C1) will increase the time it takes for the input to go from low to high and from high to low. The resistor (R1) controls how much current goes back and forth to charge and discharge the capacitor, so the size of R1 and C1 determines the speed of the oscillation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You should use a 74C14 IC <em>Schmitt trigger</em> inverter; its threshold for switching from high to low voltage is different from the threshold for switching from low to high. This ensures that the inverter doesn’t get stuck in a state in between high and low.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The Schmitt trigger inverter comes as a 14-pin <em>integrated circuit (IC)</em>, a single chip with its own internal circuitry. The number next to each pin in the circuit diagram represents the pin number on the integrated circuit. <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig1">Figure 5-1</a> shows how the pins are arranged on the 74C14 IC Schmitt trigger inverter.</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 5-1</strong> Pinout of the 74C14 Schmitt trigger inverter</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To connect an IC to a breadboard, you need to connect it across the two component areas, as in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig2">Figure 5-2</a>.</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 5-2</strong> Connecting the inverter IC across the two component areas</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This will give you connections for pins 1 to 7 on the left component area and connections for pins 8 to 14 on the right component area. Note that pin 1 is indicated by a circular indentation in one corner of the inverter or a notch at its pin 1 end.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev53"><strong>COMMON MISTAKES</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If your circuit isn’t working correctly, you might have made one of these common mistakes:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Forgetting to connect V<sub>DD</sub> (pin 14) to the positive terminal of the battery</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Forgetting to connect GND (pin 7) to the negative terminal of the battery</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Misreading the pinout of the IC</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Mistaking the positive LED pin for the negative pin</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="indent">To decrease the blinking speed, increase either the capacitor value or the resistance value of R1 (or both). To increase the blinking speed, decrease those values.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="lev54"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_39"/>HOW THE CIRCUIT WORKS</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">An inverter is a device that inverts its input. So a low input becomes a high output, and vice versa. You can build a simple inverter using a transistor and a couple of resistors, as shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig3">Figure 5-3</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch05fig3"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0039-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 5-3</strong> An inverter built using a transistor</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you have a <em>low</em> voltage (0 Volts) on the input, the transistor is turned off, and when you have a high voltage (9 Volts) on the input, the transistor is turned on.</p>&#13;
<div class="sidebar">&#13;
<p class="sidebart"><strong><span class="red">SIMPLIFYING WITH THE V<sub>DD</sub> AND GND SYMBOLS</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="spara">The symbols at the top and bottom of <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig3">Figure 5-3</a> are common in circuit diagrams. For the battery-driven circuits in this book, V<sub>DD</sub> is where you connect the positive terminal of your battery, and GND is where you connect its negative terminal.</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0039-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="spara1">You can use these two symbols to simplify your circuit diagrams a bit, because they let you omit the battery symbol and the lines connecting it to the circuit.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_40"/>When the transistor is off, you can think of it as a resistor with very high resistance between the collector and emitter (Rt in the diagram), and when the transistor is on, you can look at it as a resistor with zero resistance. You might find this easier to understand if you ignore the input for a second and just look at the output circuit, as in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig4">Figure 5-4</a>. You may have noticed that you get a voltage divider.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch05fig4"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0040-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 5-4</strong> The simple resistor with the transistor turned off</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Project 3</a>, you learned how to calculate the voltage from a voltage divider. For R1 and Rt in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig4">Figure 5-4</a>, the formula for calculating the output voltage becomes:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0040-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you have a high input, you can look at the transistor as a resistor (Rt) with zero resistance (or a wire). If you replace Rt with 0 in this formula, it doesn’t matter what the other values are: you’ll get 0 V as the output voltage, so that’s a low output.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you have a low input, you can look at the transistor as a resistor with really high resistance—say, billions of ohms. A normal value for R1 is 1,000 Ω, so if you have 9 V as V<sub>in</sub> and you try to put 1 billion ohms into the formula as Rt, the result is 9 V—a high output.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The Schmitt trigger inverter works in a similar way, but with some additional components built into the IC to make the circuit switch from high to low and from low to high at different input voltages.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The 74C14 chip you use in this project is an integrated circuit containing six inverters, which is why it has so many pins. You can see the circuit’s pinout and internal inverters in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig5">Figure 5-5</a>.</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 5-5</strong> The 74C14 chip contains six inverters</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Because of its small size, using an integrated circuit like the 74C14 saves you a lot of space compared to building the inverter from scratch.</p>&#13;

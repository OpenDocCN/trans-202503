    "Figure 1-1. The initial GIMP windows, multi-windows mode"). These windows are
    the Toolbox, the Image window, and a dialog dock. By default they occupy the full
    width of the screen, regardless of the size of your monitor. This screen layout
    can be arranged to suit your taste, and one of the first actions that many GIMP
    users take is to rearrange the screen layout so that it’s intuitive and pleasing
    to them. If you don’t like the multi-window interface, GIMP now offers a single-window
    interface, which we introduce in [The Single-Window Interface](ch01s01.html#single-window_interface

    window, which means that the Toolbox and the dialog docks will always remain above
    other windows and be visible when the Image window is active. In other words,
    you cannot minimize utility windows. You can also choose to treat the Toolbox
    and dialogs like normal windows or to simply keep them above other windows.

    it at at least 300 ppi (pixels per inch). If you plan to touch up the image, or

    resolution. For this example, we chose 300 ppi for a selection area of 4.3 × 6.3

    the image file. The level of magnification is expressed by the *zoom factor*.
    When you open an image, GIMP makes some automatic adjustments depending on the
    image size and the size of your screen. The zoom factor is 100% (actual size)
    for average sized images, less for really large files.

    how awkward it is to draw using a mouse—our signature was ugly and unnatural.
    A mouse is great for clicking, but the large pointer makes it difficult to select
    a single pixel, and it’s virtually impossible to draw a straight line or a graceful
    curve. In the coming chapters, we’ll often want to draw precise lines or smooth
    contours.

    tablet. Depending on the manufacturer, the tablet’s size, and its capabilities,
    prices can range from $20 to more than $2000\. You can find an excellent tablet
    with all the really useful features for about $350, though you can pick one up
    for less if you compromise on pressure and tilt sensitivity.

    some system files to get your tablet working. On GNU/Linux systems, support is

- en: The tablet mouse acts like a normal mouse, but with one difference. With a regular
    mouse, there is generally a component called *acceleration*. When you move the
    mouse a little, the pointer on the screen moves proportionally. If you move the
    mouse faster, the pointer moves more quickly and farther across the screen. This
    feature allows you to move the pointer across a screen 2000 pixels wide with only
    a slight gesture of the hand, while still allowing you to make very precise movements
    slowly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The tablet mouse does not use acceleration. A position on the tablet corresponds
    to the equivalent position on the screen, which always remains constant. In other
    words, the top left corner of the tablet always corresponds to the top left corner
    of the screen. This means that you’ll have to move your hand farther to move the
    pointer across the screen than you would with an ordinary mouse, especially if
    you have a larger tablet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The tablet’s stylus behaves in the same way. When the tip of the pen is close
    to the tablet’s surface, the pointer moves to the corresponding position on the
    screen. Touching the pen to the tablet is equivalent to left-clicking with the
    mouse. You can click, double-click, and drag using the pen. You can also right-click
    by pressing a button on the pen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The pen usually has two active ends: one for drawing and one for erasing. The
    drawing end often looks like a fine felt-tip pen. Sometimes the pen will come
    with more than one tip, and these tips resemble different drawing tools. The other
    end is usually shaped like a pencil’s eraser. You can associate different tools
    with these ends and save your settings in GIMP. We associate the Paintbrush tool
    with the normal tip and the Eraser tool with the other end. Some tablets even
    allow you to have several different pens, which could be set up as a red brush,
    a yellow pen, and a black pencil, for example.'

- en: The amount of pressure that you apply when drawing with the pen is transmitted
    to the drawing application. In GIMP, most drawing tools use a feature called *paint
    dynamics*, which handles input from the tablet’s pen. This will be covered in
    detail in [Paint Dynamics](ch15s03.html#paint_dynamics-id00120 "Paint Dynamics").
    If you choose the Basic Dynamics, pen pressure is correlated to the brush opacity
    and pen velocity to the brush size.

    controlled by pen pressure. The brush size is controlled by the pen’s velocity,
    which you can see by looking at the underline—the pen was moving faster toward
    the left. The second signature was made with the Paintbrush tool, using the same
    dynamics. The third was made using the Ink tool, which is useful for simulating

    parameters of the Paintbrush tool. The lines were drawn in the same way, increasing
    the pen pressure from left to right. The brush was also the same. For the first
    line, only opacity was controlled by the pen pressure. For the second line, only
    hardness, which means that the brush is less fuzzy when pressure increases. For
    the third line, only size changed. For the fourth line, all three parameters (opacity,
    hardness, and size) were controlled by pen pressure.'

<p class="ChapterIntro">Information is power, some say. Data is the new gold, others proclaim. But raw information and data are often meaningless without context. Data is a valuable asset only when properly analyzed, interpreted, and understood. As a result, new fields proliferate. Data scientist, data engineer, data analyst, business intelligence consultant, and machine learning engineer are all increasingly popular careers, and they all share a common role: interpreting data using visual tools such as graphs and dashboards.</p>
<p class="TX">The goal of this book is to help you create beautiful dashboard apps so that you can visualize your data with just a few lines of code. Whether you’re an aspiring professional, you work with data on a regular basis, or you just love to play with numbers, this book will give you the tools and education to harness the power of data.</p>

<p class="TNI">The Plotly Dash framework makes it super easy for you to build your own dashboards. <i>Dashboards</i> are web apps that allow you and your users to dynamically explore data using interactive widgets that receive user input to explain output. For example, they might have sliders, text fields, buttons, and dropdown menus to allow the user to choose what data to show in the resultant charts and graphs, like the maps and bar charts you see in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. The interactivity of dashboard apps is what has made them increasingly popular in recent years.</p>

<p class="TX">Building a Plotly Dash app without proper guidance can be hard. This book will teach you how to create your first interactive, highly visual analytical dashboard apps using practical instructions and easy-to-understand tutorials. It will guide you from absolute Dash beginner to creating your own dashboard apps quickly and confidently.</p>
<p class="TX">Reading this book will also help you hone crucial 21st-century skills including programming, data analysis, and data science, as well as data visualization and presentation. The community is hungry for stunning data visualizations of dynamic and growing datasets, generated by myriads of data sources such as smart homes, factories, web stores, social networks, video hosting services, and health tracking devices.</p>
<p class="TX">As the scale and complexity of data proliferate, we’ll see a growing need for dashboard applications that can provide users with a real-time, data-driven overview of what’s happening in the world. Chances are you’ve already used browser-based dashboards in your own life: Google Analytics, Facebook Ad Manager, and Salesforce Dashboards are some examples of real-life dashboard applications. <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> shows a screenshot of the Google Analytics dashboard app that lets you track real-time website traffic.</p>
<p class="TX">This dashboard shows us that, at the time the screenshot was recorded, most users in the United States and Asia were still sleeping while users in Europe were already busy searching the web. How seamlessly these insights <span aria-label=" Page xix. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xix" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>arise when visualizing the data properly using a dashboard app! Creating these types of applications has been possible only for skilled coders and large organizations that were able to connect real-time data sources with dynamic websites to create the unique value proposition provided by dashboard apps.</p>
<p class="TX"><a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> shows a screenshot of the Johns Hopkins dashboard app that visualizes the spread of COVID-19 using fresh and dynamic data streams.</p>

<p class="TX">You can view this dashboard live at <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.xhtml"><i>https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.xhtml</i></a>. The dashboard shows a dynamic counter that tracks the global number of cases, a map that tracks hotspots, figures on the cases per country, a progression of the spread over time, and many more static and dynamic statistics. The dashboard app is able to help hundreds of thousands of people each month get insight from data—insight they would not have obtained using only spreadsheets and tabular data.</p>

This is one of the dashboards you will learn to make in this book!</p>
<p class="TX">The potential uses for dashboard applications are pretty much infinite. For each data source, there’s a useful dashboard application waiting to be created by you.</p>
<p class="TX">We, the authors, have spent some sleepless nights coding and debugging and figuring out how to make our first Dash apps work. Books on Dash are rare, let alone ones that are also easy to understand and suitable for a Python beginner. So, by starting this project, we decided that it’s time to change that!</p>
<p class="TX">Check out the many sample apps in the Dash Enterprise App Gallery at <a href="https://dash.gallery/Portal"><i>https://<wbr/>dash<wbr/>.gallery<wbr/>/Portal</i></a> for more examples (see <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). Some apps, like the AI Speech Recognition app, are fewer than 100 lines of code!</p>

<p class="TNI">We’ve established that dashboards are great, so let’s look at why you should use Plotly Dash for the job. There are a lot of great alternative frameworks for creating dashboards, including Streamlit, Shiny, Jupyter, Tableau, Infogram, and many more. However, we found a number of compelling reasons to consider Dash over its competitors in a wide variety of use cases:</p>
<ul class="List-1">
<li class="BL">Dash apps can be written in pure Python, which means if you’re familiar with Python, you’ll be able to get up and running very quickly. It also means it’s easy to integrate data and results from your existing Python work into a Dash app.</li>
<li class="BL">Python is very expressive and Dash code can be relatively compact, meaning you’re able to prototype and iterate much more quickly, which can be very useful when developing apps to a deadline or in an agile environment where requirements are regularly changing.</li>
<li class="BL">Dash hides complexity from you, such as communication between the JavaScript frontend and the Python backend. So you don’t need to take on overcomplicated responsibilities such as serialization, deserialization, defining API endpoints, or making HTTP requests. This can significantly reduce boilerplate code.</li>
<li class="BL">Dash is developed by a Plotly team of people, meaning it has excellent integration with the Plotly graphing library. Plotly and therefore Dash are great choices for making web apps because these interactive graphs are themselves based on web technologies.</li>
<li class="BL">Dash is built on top of the heavily used Flask framework, giving us many deployment options, ranging from fully managed to self-hosted.</li>
<li class="BL">Although Dash can only be used with Python, it’s very extensible, allowing you to mix in CSS and JavaScript, and even write your own components using React and the Dash component generator.</li>
</ul>
<p class="TX">Although Dash has many advantages, no software is perfect. To help you decide what’s best for you, here are some of Dash’s limitations:</p>
<ul class="List-1">
<li class="BL">Dash has good performance, but if you have a very large number of components, have incredibly complex apps, or are processing huge datasets, you might start to see your app slowing down.</li>
<li class="BL">Dash is slightly more complicated to get up and running than some no-code or low-code alternatives, and integrations with other enterprise software are not as developed as they are with alternative frameworks; for example, PowerBI has very tight integration with Microsoft enterprise software.</li>
<li class="BL">While Dash is pure Python, to properly understand what’s going on, you will need to know the basics of HTML and CSS.</li>
</ul>

<p class="TNI">We wrote this book with the total Dash beginner in mind. Although a little Python background knowledge will help you get the most out of the book, we don’t assume you have a lot of programming experience, so we explain basics such as how to install Dash and related libraries, how to set up your programming environment, and how to use libraries like pandas. An entire course on Python is beyond the scope of this book, but <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a></span> will go over some of the Python basics that are key to building Dash apps, as well as direct you to resources to help you dig in deeper where you need to.</p>
<p class="TX">In practice, many readers will already have some experience with the Python programming language. If you know Python but you don’t have experience setting up a programming environment yet, start with <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a></span>.</p>
<p class="TX">If, on the other hand, you already know Python and you’ve set up your programming environment (preferably PyCharm), you can safely skip to <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a></span>, where we’ll give you a short tutorial on the important pandas library. If you’re an expert coder who knows all those things, just skip all the introductory chapters and start with <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a></span>, where we’ll show you how to create your first Dash app.</p>

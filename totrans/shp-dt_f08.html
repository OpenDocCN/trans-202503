<p class="ChapterIntro">The first time I, Colleen, confronted my own hesitancy with math was when geometry provided a solution to an art class problem I faced: translating a flat painting onto a curved vase. Straight lines from my friend’s canvas didn’t behave the same way on the curved vase. Distances between points on the painting grew or shrank with the curvature. We’d stumbled upon the differences between the geometry we’d learned in class (where geometry behaved like the canvas painting) and the geometry of real-world objects like the vase. Real-world data often behaves more like the vase than the canvas painting. 
As an industry data scientist, I’ve worked with many non-data-science professionals who want to learn new data science methods but either haven’t encountered a lot of math or coding in their career path or have a lingering fear of math from prior educational experiences. Math-heavy papers without coding examples often limit the toolsets other professionals can use to solve important problems in their own fields.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xx" title="xx"/>Math is simply another language with which to understand the world around us; like any language, it’s possible to learn. This book is focused on geometry, but it is not a math textbook. We avoid proofs, rarely use equations, and try to simplify the math behind the algorithms as much as possible to make these tools accessible to a wider audience. If you are more mathematically advanced and want the full mathematical theory, we provide references at the end of the book.</p>
<p>Geometry underlies every single machine learning algorithm and problem setup, and thousands of geometry-based algorithms exist today. This book focuses on a few dozen algorithms in use now, with preference given to those with packages to implement them in R. If you want to understand how geometry relates to algorithms, how to implement geometry-based algorithms with code, or how to think about problems you encounter through the lens of geometry, keep reading.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Though this book is for anyone anywhere who wants a hands-on guide to network science, geometry-based aspects of machine learning, and topology-based algorithms, some background in statistics, machine learning, and a programming language (R or Python, ideally) will be helpful. This book was designed for the following:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Healthcare professionals working with small sets of patient data</li>
<li>Math students looking for an applied side of what they’re learning</li>
<li>Small-business owners who want to use their data to drive sales</li>
<li>Physicists or chemists interested in using topological data analysis for a research project</li>
<li>Curious sociologists who are wary of proof-based texts</li>
<li>Statisticians or data scientists looking to beef up their toolsets</li>
<li>Educators looking for practical examples to show their students</li>
<li>Engineers branching out into machine learning</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll be surveying many areas of science and business in our examples and will cover dozens of algorithms shaping data science today. Each chapter will focus on the intuition behind the algorithms discussed and will provide examples of how to use those algorithms to solve a problem using the R programming language. While the book is written with examples presented in R, our downloadable repository (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://nostarch.com/download/ShapeofData_PythonCode.zip">https://nostarch.com/download/ShapeofData_PythonCode.zip</a>) includes R and Python code for examples where Python has an analogous function to support users of both languages. Feel free to skip around to sections most relevant to your interests.</p>

<h2 id="h1-503083f08-0003"><a class="XrefDestination" id="DownloadingandInstallingR"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083f08-004"/>Downloading and Installing R</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">We’ll be using the R programming language in this book. R is easy to install and compatible with macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems. You can choose the download for your system at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://cloud.r-project.org">https://cloud.r-project.org</a>. You might be prompted to click a link for your geographic location (or a general cloud <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxii" title="xxii"/>connection option). If you haven’t installed R before, you can choose the first-time installation of the base, which is the first download option on the R for Windows page.</p>
<p>Once you click the first-time option, you should see a screen that will give you an option to download R for Windows.</p>
<p>After R downloads, you’ll follow the installation instructions that your system provides as a prompt. This will vary slightly depending on the operating system. However, the installation guide will take you through the steps needed to set up R.</p>
<p>You may want to publish your projects or connect R with other open source projects, such as Python. RStudio provides a comfortable interface with options to connect R more easily with other platforms. You can find RStudio’s download at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://www.rstudio.com">https://www.rstudio.com</a>. Once you download RStudio, simply follow your operating system’s command prompts to install with the configurations that work best for your use case.</p>
<h2 id="h1-503083f08-0004"><a class="XrefDestination" id="InstallingRPackages"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083f08-005"/>Installing R Packages</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">R has several options for installing new packages on your system. The command line option is probably the easiest. You’ll use the <code>install.packages("</code><var>package_name</var><code>")</code> option, where <var>package_name</var> is the name of the package you want to install, such as <code>install.packages("mboost")</code> to install the mboost package. From there, you may be asked to choose your geographic location for the download. The package will then download (and download any package dependencies that are not already on your machine).</p>
<p>You can also use your graphical user interface (GUI) to install a package. This might be preferable if you want to browse available packages rather than install just one specific package to meet your needs. You can select <b>Install package(s)</b> from the Packages menu option after you launch R on your machine.</p>
<p>You’ll be prompted to select your location, and the installation will happen as it would with the command line option for package installation.</p>
<h2 id="h1-503083f08-0005"><a class="XrefDestination" id="GettingHelpwithR"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083f08-006"/>Getting Help with R</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">R has many useful features if you need help with a function or a package in your code. The <code>help()</code> function allows you to get information about a function or package that you have installed in R. Adding the package name after the function (such as <code>help(glmboost, "mboost")</code> for help with the generalized linear modeling boosted regression function through the mboost package) will pull up information about a package not yet installed in your machine so that you can understand what the function does before deciding to install the new package. This is helpful if you’re looking for something specific but not sure that what you’re finding online is exactly what you need. In lieu of using the <code>help()</code> function, you can add a question mark before the function name (such as <code>?glmboost</code>).</p>
<p>You can also browse for vignettes demonstrating how to use functions in a package using the command <code>browseVignettes()</code>, which will pull up <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxiii" title="xxiii"/>vignettes for each package you have installed in R. If you want a vignette for a specific package, you can name that package like so: <code>browseVignettes(package="mboost")</code>. Many packages come with a good overview of how to apply the package’s functions to an example dataset.</p>
<p>R has a broad user base, and internet searches or coding forums can provide additional resources for specific issues related to a package. There are also many good tutorials that overview the basic programming concepts and common functions in R. If you are less familiar with programming, you may want to go through a free tutorial on R programming or work with data in R before attempting the code in this book.</p>
<p>Because R is an evolving language with new packages added and removed regularly, we encourage you to keep up with developments via package websites and web searches. Packages that are discontinued can still be installed and used as legacy packages but require some caution, as they aren’t updated by the package author. We’ll see one of these in this book with an example of how to install a legacy package. Similarly, new packages are developed regularly, and you should find and use new packages in the field of geometry as they become available.</p>
<h2 id="h1-503083f08-0006"><a class="XrefDestination" id="SupportforPythonUsers"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083f08-007"/>Support for Python Users</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">While this book presents examples in R code, our downloadable repository (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://nostarch.com/download/ShapeofData_PythonCode.zip">https://nostarch.com/download/ShapeofData_PythonCode.zip</a>) includes translations to Python packages and functions where possible. Most examples have a Python translation for Python users. However, some translations do not exist or include only the packages that do not install correctly on some operating systems. We encourage you to develop Python applications if they do not currently exist, and it is likely that more support in Python will become available for methods in this book (and methods developed in the future).</p>
<h2 id="h1-503083f08-0007"><a class="XrefDestination" id="Summary"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083f08-008"/>Summary</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Mathematics can be intimidating for some people, but it forms the foundation of a lot of hot topics in machine learning and technology these days. Understanding the geometry behind the buzzwords will give you a deeper understanding of how the algorithms function and how they can be used to solve problems. You might even have some fun along the way.</p>

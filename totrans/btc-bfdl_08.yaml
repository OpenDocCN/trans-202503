    is similar to digging for gold: It takes time and effort—hence the term *mining*.
    The difference between mining gold and mining bitcoins is that a Bitcoin miner
    uses electricity and computational labor rather than physical labor. Mining is
    also the process by which new Bitcoin transactions are added to the block-chain,
    or the public ledger. By adding a new block of transactions to the blockchain,
    the miner who added the block is rewarded with newly minted bitcoins (as well
    as old bitcoins in the form of transaction fees).'

    risky. Should you mine bitcoins? Probably not. In this chapter we’ll explore the
    difficulties and hazards, but the short answer is that deciding whether to mine
    bitcoins is like deciding whether or not to mine gold. Mining gold in financially
    meaningful quantities requires a high degree of expertise, access to cheap labor
    and electricity, raising (and risking!) significant capital, and waiting years
    for a return on investment. If you are reading this book, it’s best for you to
    leave Bitcoin mining to the professionals. *However*, if you are not motivated

    add a transaction to the blockchain to send bitcoins to you, and then after you
    gave her something of value (e.g., a cake), she could produce a new ledger in
    which that transaction never happened. The second ledger would conflict with the
    first ledger, so this abuse would certainly not go unnoticed, but it wouldn’t
    be clear which ledger was correct. Presumably, the first ledger would be correct
    and any subsequently created ledger that conflicts would be invalid (after all,
    you already gave away your cake). But peers on the network may disagree as to

- en: Because Bitcoin was intended to be a currency with a finite supply, miners can’t
    generate new bitcoins forever. This means that Satoshi needed to somehow choose
    a point in time by which all the bitcoins would be generated. If all bitcoins
    were generated in the first year of Bitcoin’s existence, the currency would have
    favored early adopters too much. Conversely, if bitcoins were generated too slowly,
    newcomers might not have had enough incentive to take a chance and devote their
    computing power to this strange, new project called Bitcoin. Also, if bitcoins
    were generated so slowly that it would take thousands of years before they were
    all mined, bitcoins might not have been perceived as a finite commodity but rather
    one whose supply was constantly being inflated. For better or worse, Satoshi chose
    a scheme in which bitcoins would be distributed over a century at a rate that
    is reduced by half approximately every four years^([3](../Text/footnote.html#footnote52))
    until the total number eventually reaches 21 million (see [Figure 8-1](../Text/ch08.html#ch08fig1)).

    known as the *difficulty target*. If the result is greater than the target, the
    block remains unsolved. When this happens, the miner must try a different nonce,
    which is contained in the header and hence affects the hash. Because cryptographic
    hash functions produce completely new outputs when the input is changed by even
    the tiniest amount, changing the nonce value results in a totally new hash for
    the entire block header. By repeatedly changing the nonce value, eventually a
    hash output will be found that is less than the target. Typically, a miner simply

    In the first year, most miners used the CPUs on their laptops to mine bitcoins.
    Then people realized they could repurpose graphics cards designed originally for
    demanding computer games to mine bitcoins. The graphics cards, specifically the
    graphics-processing units (GPUs) on them, were thousands of times faster and more
    energy efficient than CPUs. Not long thereafter, hardware developers discovered
    they could use field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), which are specialized devices
    used for computer chip prototype development, to mine bitcoins even faster than
    GPUs. Until this point, nobody had manufactured hardware specifically to mine
    bitcoins. GPUs and FPGAs were off-the-shelf hardware that was just repurposed
    for Bitcoin mining. However, when the Bitcoin economy became extensive, it became
    worthwhile for computer chip developers to create *application specific integrated

  zh: 比特币的成功依赖于它作为一个去中心化网络的特性。在比特币的初期，任何人都可以作为挖矿节点加入比特币网络；然而，现在挖矿主要由那些拥有资源、专业知识和资本的专业人士进行，这些资源和能力是普通人无法企及的。这一趋势是否在*重新中心化*比特币？这是比特币用户、矿工和开发者之间的一个辩论话题。
- en: Another related subject we haven’t discussed in detail yet is the limit to the
    number of transactions that can be included in each block. Obviously, a real,
    physical limit exists in the sense that an individual cannot include an infinite
    number of transactions in any block. However, a smaller limit is imposed as a
    rule in the Bitcoin protocol (i.e., although the physical limit might be in the
    range of millions of transactions per block, the rule-based limit is in the thousands
    of transactions range). The original purpose of this self-imposed limit^([14](../Text/footnote.html#footnote63))
    was to prevent the blockchain from becoming bloated with pointless transactions
    (i.e., spam), but some have argued that the limit serves a greater purpose, which
    is to maintain decentralization.

  zh: 另一个我们尚未详细讨论的相关话题是每个区块可以包含的交易数量的限制。显然，存在一个真实的物理限制，即一个区块中不可能包含无限多的交易。然而，比特币协议中规定了一个较小的规则性限制（即，尽管物理限制可能在每个区块数百万笔交易的范围内，但规则性限制则在数千笔交易的范围内）。这一自我设限的最初目的是^([14](../Text/footnote.html#footnote63))防止区块链被无意义的交易（即垃圾邮件）膨胀，但也有人认为这一限制有更大的作用，那就是保持去中心化。
- en: In addition to having a computing device that can perform SHA256 hashes very
    quickly, mining nodes *and* relay nodes must have sufficient storage space to
    store a full copy of the blockchain. If the blocks that make up the chain become
    much larger than they are now, not only will miners need faster computers, but
    their systems will also need the capability of storing substantial amounts of
    data (possibly in the form of large data centers). This would further increase
    the capital requirements of miners and inevitably lead some to abandon the profession.
    Fewer mining nodes would make the network more centralized by degrees. For this
    reason, some miners have advocated for limiting the number of transactions per
    block to a small number (although this would ultimately drive up transaction fees).
    Is such a desire justified?

  zh: 除了拥有能够快速执行SHA256哈希计算的计算设备外，挖矿节点*和*中继节点还必须具备足够的存储空间来存储区块链的完整副本。如果构成区块链的区块变得比现在大得多，不仅矿工们需要更快的计算机，他们的系统也需要具备存储大量数据的能力（可能以大型数据中心的形式）。这将进一步增加矿工的资本需求，并不可避免地导致一些人放弃这一职业。更少的挖矿节点将使得网络逐步变得更加中心化。正因如此，一些矿工提倡将每个区块的交易数量限制在一个较小的范围内（尽管这最终会推高交易费用）。这种愿望是否有其合理性？
- en: Although it’s a complicated issue, we can use the gold mining analogy to explain.
    Is gold a centrally controlled commodity? Very few people, by percentage, have
    the resources, time, and expertise to mine gold. However, no monopoly exists on
    gold mining; any well-financed venture can search for gold and attempt to mine
    it. Similarly, even though Bitcoin mining might no longer be viable for casual
    users and instead become a venture performed by companies and organizations, a
    single institution would never obtain sole control of Bitcoin mining. Nonetheless,
    it is best to keep a close eye on the future number of Bitcoin miners.

  zh: 尽管这是一个复杂的问题，但我们可以通过黄金开采的类比来解释。黄金是一种集中控制的商品吗？只有极少数人拥有开采黄金所需的资源、时间和专业知识。然而，黄金开采并没有垄断，任何资金充足的企业都可以寻找黄金并尝试开采。类似地，尽管比特币挖矿可能不再适合普通用户，而是成为由公司和组织进行的商业活动，但单一机构永远无法获得比特币挖矿的独占控制权。不过，最好密切关注未来比特币矿工的数量变化。

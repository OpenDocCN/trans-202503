<p class="noindent">In today’s world of contract manufacturing and turnkey service providers, designers tend to pick from a palette of existing processes to develop products. Most consumer electronic devices are an amalgamation of rigid PCBs with SMT reflow or through-hole wave soldering, ABS or PC injection molding, sheet-metal forming, and some finishing processes like painting or electroplating. These options cover the full range of utility most products require. Really outstanding products, however, also tend to introduce new materials or novel manufacturing processes.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Developing those new processes doesn’t have to be expensive—as long as you’re willing to go onto the factory floor and direct the improvements yourself. In other words, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_252"/>expensive bit of process development is typically paying the experts developing and qualifying the process, not so much the equipment or materials.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To prove that point to myself, I started exploring flex circuits as a design medium. Instead of using a 1- or 2-millimeter-thick rigid substrate composed of woven glass fiber impregnated with a stiff epoxy, flex circuits typically use a pliable polymer substrate just fractions of a millimeter thick. Polyimide is a popular substrate in flex circuits because of its ability to withstand soldering temperatures. Although flex-circuit technology is common inside consumer products (a mobile phone probably contains at least a half-dozen flex PCBs, connecting peripherals like buttons, cameras, and displays to the mainboard), this technology is underrepresented in hobby and DIY products. But I don’t think it has to be.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I had a hunch that the right kind of product designed in flex could enable new and creative applications, but I wasn’t quite sure how, so I decided to learn more about the unique benefits and challenges of designing for flexible circuits. As part of a project where I explored the guts of SD cards, which I’ll talk more about in <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9</a>, I needed to create an adapter for my Novena that would allow me to snoop and emulate the NAND flash memory found inside certain styles of older SD cards. The thinness and pliability of flexible circuits were a great match for the job.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The resulting adapter was very thin; it fit perfectly under the TSOP package of the NAND. The bendy nature of the board meant I could also accommodate a broad variety of target board shapes, even boards much larger than a typical SD card. Although a useful application of flexible circuits, it still felt like I was just scratching the surface of possibility.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_253"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0253-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>My custom flex adapter</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Then came the moment of serendipity. While working on the SD card project, I met Jie Qi, then a PhD candidate at the MIT Media Lab, who was combining papercraft and electronics as part of her research. She was part of the group of MIT Media Lab students I took on a tour of Shenzhen in January 2012, and seeing examples of her paper circuits set the gears turning in my head.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0253-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;

<p class="cap"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_255"/><em>The flower circuits inside</em> Pu Gong Ying Tu</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Using nothing more than copper tape, paper, and dollops of solder or tape to hold components in place, Jie was able to craft sublime works of art that glowed and interacted with viewers. These enchanting masterpieces showed how electronics could be used not just as a functional medium, but also as an expressive medium, inspiring wonder and awe. The photo here shows the insides of one of her famous early works, <em>Pu Gong Ying Tu (Dandelion Painting)</em>, where the circuitry itself is as much a work of art as the painting overlaying it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Jie is also very passionate about education, and she saw great potential in paper electronics to make technology more relevant and accessible to non-engineering audiences. On our trip to Shenzhen, we discussed the possibility of building circuits on flex and then soldering a flex circuit onto paper. In the end, she felt that would be at best a marginal improvement. Although soldering isn’t a difficult skill to master, the high temperatures, chemicals, and specialized equipment involved are a major deterrent to beginners. What would really be magical is if circuits could be assembled like stickers on a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_256"/>page. Wouldn’t it be great if we could use flex-circuit technology with traditional SMT reflow processes to create modules that users could then stick onto wires made of copper tape?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">And that’s how we came to collaborate on Chibitronics, a project in which we designed a set of peel-and-stick electronic circuits for crafting and education. Chibitronics has been an open hardware project from the start, and you can still find all the activities from the <em>Circuit Sticker Sketchbook</em>, the source code for all microcontrollers used, and other technical details through the project’s wiki at <em><a href="http://chibitronics.com/wiki/">http://chibitronics.com/wiki/</a></em>.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec143"><strong>CRAFTING WITH CIRCUITS</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">The solution we arrived at in early 2012 built on a body of work from Professor Leah Buechley’s High-Low Tech research group at MIT. We decided to build circuits on a flexible polyimide substrate with <em>anisotropic tape</em> (also called <em>Z-tape</em>, because electricity only flows vertically through the tape, not laterally) laminated on the back.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_258"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0258-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>A piece of Z-tape under a microscope</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Using Z-tape allows end users to assemble circuits without high-temperature processes like soldering or reflow. The ability to simply stick components in place is incredibly useful for art projects, which often involve heat-sensitive and/or pliable material substrates like paper, fabric, and plastic. Circuit stickers and copper tape are flexible, too, further enabling anyone to integrate electronics into projects using nontraditional materials. Such friendly and expressive materials encourage creators to turn the circuits themselves into beautiful works of art.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0258-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>Circuit stickers on paper</em></p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_259"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0259-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>Circuit stickers on fabric</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Creating these circuit stickers revolved around the limitations of the Z-tape. In the magnified section of Z-tape laminated onto a polyimide substrate shown here, the silvery-white stipples are tiny metal particles that span from one side of the adhesive layer to the other according to a statistical distribution. Given the nature of the metal distribution, to ensure good electrical contact, each pad on a circuit sticker needed to be fairly large. Furthermore, traces very close to each other could be shorted out by the embedded metal particles, so as I designed the circuits, I had to be careful to leave enough space between exposed pads. The datasheet for the Z-tape material contains rules for the minimum pad size and spacing, so I used those as a guide.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec144"><strong>Developing a New Process</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">It’s one thing to design stickers containing working electronic circuits, but it’s a whole different thing to actually build them. No standard manufacturing processes existed that could produce circuit stickers as we envisioned them. At last, I had a meaningful opportunity to test my theory that new process development can be done cheaply if you’re willing to do it yourself. So I started my own little research program to explore flex-circuit media and the challenges of making circuit stickers out of them, all on a shoestring R&amp;D budget.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec145"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_260"/><strong>Visiting the Factory</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">As a first step, I visited the facility where flex PCBs are manufactured. The visit was eye-opening.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0260-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>A worker manually aligning coverlay onto flex-circuit material</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Instead of soldermask, flex-circuit traces are protected by a polyimide sheet called <em>coverlay</em>. Soldermask is too brittle and will crack if bent, but coverlay reliably stays intact over thousands of flexing cycles. Sometimes, however, you want to make portions of a flex circuit stiff; for instance, a part of the circuit might need to stay stiff for mechanical mounting, and a stiff circuit is also helpful for SMT processing.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0260-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>Steel plates being laminated to the back of flex-circuit material</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_261"/>I knew that polyimide stiffeners could be laminated to flex, but as it turns out, steel lamination is also possible. I wouldn’t have known that if I hadn’t taken the factory tour myself. Visiting the factory in person also gave me an invaluable opportunity to see the wide range of complex shapes that could be produced thanks to die cutting. Having a variety of possible shapes was key, because we wanted to make the circuit stickers look cool, too. Questions like how narrow we could cut the material or how tight a radius is allowable in a die cut are difficult to answer by email, but the answers were intuitively obvious after I saw the process in person.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0261-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>The intricate flex-circuit shapes achievable with die cutting</em></p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec146"><strong>Performing a Process Capability Test</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">After the factory visit, the next step was to do a <em>process capability test</em> to push the limits of the manufacturing process. We designed a non-homogenous sheet of sticker variants that exercised all kinds of capabilities: long via chains, 3-mil line widths, 0201 components (a small SMT package size), 0.5 mm pitch QFN parts (surface-mount components that have all their contacts on the bottom), bulky components, the use of soldermask instead of coverlay, fine detail in silkscreening, captive tabs, curved cutouts, hybrid SMT and through-hole <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_262"/>soldering techniques, Z-tape lamination, and more. Our process capability test intentionally broke parts of the manufacturing process to discover weak links that could prevent our design from working out.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0262-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>The circuit sticker design we manufactured for the process capability test</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_263"/>When I first presented the design, the factory rejected it outright, saying it was impossible to manufacture. After I explained my goals, however, the factory agreed to produce it, with the understanding that I’d accept and pay for all units made, naturally including the defective ones. Through analyzing the failure modes of the defective units, I developed a set of design rules for maintaining high yield (and therefore lowering cost) on the circuit stickers.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Based on these design rules, Jie and I created our first set of “production candidate” stickers. They included LEDs of four different colors (white, red, blue, and yellow), as well as two sets of smart stickers. The first set of smart stickers contained a preprogrammed microcontroller that could generate patterns of light, such as fading, heartbeats, twinkling, and blinking. We called these the “effects” stickers; they are a form of <em>physical programming</em> that enables noncoders to customize the behavior of their projects. The second set contained a user-programmable microcontroller with a fun record-and-playback capability loaded into it as a demo, along with three sensors. We called these the “sensor &amp; microcontroller” stickers.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We ran small batches of our production candidates to find problems we might encounter should we need to scale up, and we thoroughly investigated any issues that would affect reliability, yield, or usability. In particular, we had to develop a novel method for laminating Z-tape onto the back of the stickers that would be process-compatible with the type of die cutting necessary to create stickers.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After two iterations of production candidates, we felt we were ready to see what other people could do with circuit stickers. As this was part of Jie’s doctoral research, we had two options for doing user testing. The traditional academic approach would have been to apply for a budget from her advisor, produce a limited number of stickers, and conduct a series of closed workshops to study how young and creative <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_264"/>minds interacted with this new media. But this happened in 2013, so viable crowdfunding platforms unlocked the possibility of offering our research directly to interested users, thus allowing us to conduct research at scale. The MIT Media Lab where Jie researched is also very keyed in to the possibilities enabled by research at scale, as embodied by their “deploy” initiative. In 2011, when Joi Ito became the Media Lab’s new director, he started transforming the Media Lab’s culture from “demo or die” to “deploy or die,” which was eventually shortened to the less menacing “deploy” directive. Under the old “demo or die” regime, research groups were encouraged to create whizzy demonstrations of technology that could help raise money. Under Ito’s directive, the idea is to get technology out of the lab and into the wild by conducting research at scale through tools like crowdfunding and lean hardware.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In November 2013, we launched a crowdfunding campaign with Crowd Supply. It was very important to us to remain pure to the academic mission behind the circuit stickers, so we set our funding goal at just $1. If even one person thought circuit stickers might be interesting, we’d produce the stickers and work with that person to gather feedback. And, of course, we would make that research available to the world, in case someone wanted to fork the project or otherwise hack their circuit stickers.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We beat our modest goal by several orders of magnitude, closing just shy of $60,000 after a little over one month of funding and a very low-key campaign.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec147"><strong>DELIVERING ON A PROMISE</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">As part of our campaign, we stated that we would ship orders for fulfillment by May 2014. Thankfully, we were able to meet our goal, right on time.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_265"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0265-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>Sixty-two cartons containing over a thousand Chibitronics starter kits, waiting for pickup</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Delivering on time is no simple task for any crowdfunded project, however. I made the contentious choice to use Crowd Supply in part because they show more savvy around vetting hardware products, and the services they offer to campaigns (fulfillment, tier-one customer support, post-campaign preorder support, and rolling delivery dates based on demand versus capacity) are a boon for hardware upstarts. Getting fulfillment, customer support, and an ongoing e-commerce site as part of the package meant we didn’t have to hire someone to deal with all of that. Whether your “company” consists of just two people trialing an academic project or a couple of people working out of a garage, that’s a big deal.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Crowd Supply doesn’t have the same media footprint or brand power that Kickstarter has, which can make it harder to raise as much money. But at the end of the day, I feel it’s very important to establish an example of sustainable crowdfunding practices that’s better for both the entrepreneur and the consumer. It’s not just about a money grab today; it’s about building a brand and reputation that can be trusted for years to come.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec148"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_266"/><strong>WHY ON-TIME DELIVERY IS IMPORTANT</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">I set a personal challenge for Chibitronics to take our delivery commitment to backers very seriously. I’ve seen too many underperforming crowdfunding campaigns, and I’m deeply concerned that crowdfunding for hardware is becoming synonymous with scams and spams.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been plagued by non-delivery and scams, and their blithe, <em>caveat emptor</em> attitude around campaigns highlights the conflict of interest between consumers and crowdfunding websites. The crowdfunding sites are basically saying to backers, “Hey, thanks for the nickel, but what happened to your dollar is your problem.” I’m honestly worried that crowdfunding will get such a bad reputation that it eventually won’t be a viable platform for well-intentioned entrepreneurs and innovators.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The bottom line is this: if I can’t prove to current and future backers that I can deliver a project on time, I stand to lose a valuable platform for launching my future products. Fortunately, we definitely proved ourselves with Chibitronics, and I’ve continued to use Crowd Supply for other crowdfunding projects since.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec149"><strong>LESSONS LEARNED</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">We didn’t deliver Chibitronics on time because we had it easy, though. When I drew up the original campaign timeline, my minimum and maximum bounds on delivery time spanned from just after Chinese New Year 2014 (February) to around April. I padded that schedule by one month beyond the max, just to be safe, and we used every last bit of this padding.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I made a lot of mistakes along the way, but through a combination of hard work, luck, planning, and strong factory relationships, we successfully overcame many hardships. Here are a few lessons I learned during the process.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec150"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_267"/><strong>Not All Simple Requests Are Simple for Everyone</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Every Chibitronics starter kit included a physical copy of a fantastic book Jie wrote as a step-by-step, self-instruction guide to designing with circuit stickers, the <em>Circuit Sticker Sketchbook</em> (shown on <a href="ch08.xhtml#page_256">pages 256</a>–<a href="ch08.xhtml#page_257">257</a>). The book is unusual because you’re meant to paste electronic circuits into it, so we had to customize several aspects of the printing. The paper had to be the right thickness to get good light diffusion when LEDs were placed underneath a sheet. The binding needed special attention for a better circuit-crafting experience, and there’s even a little pocket in the back to hold swatches of craft material used as part of the projects in the book.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The printer found most of these requests relatively easy to accommodate, but one in particular threw them for a loop. The book’s metal spiral binding had to be nonconductive so that placing copper tape on the binding wouldn’t accidentally cause a short circuit.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Checking a wire for conductivity seems like a simple enough request for someone who designs circuits for a living, but for a book printer, it’s weird. No part of traditional book printing or binding requires such knowledge. The printer originally said they couldn’t guarantee anything about the conductivity of the binding wire. Sure enough, while the first sample wire was nonconductive, the second was conductive, and the printer couldn’t explain why.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Face-to-face meetings were invaluable here. Instead of yelling at the printer over email, we arranged a meeting with them during one of my monthly trips to Shenzhen. We had a productive discussion about their concerns, and at the conclusion of the meeting, we ordered them a $5 multimeter in exchange for a guarantee of a nonconductive book spine. In the end, the printer was simply unwilling to guarantee something for which they had no quality control procedure, which is completely reasonable. We just had to teach them how to use a multimeter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_268"/>This unusual nonconductivity requirement did extend our lead time by several days and added a few cents to the cost of the book, but overall, I was willing to accept that compromise.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec151"><strong>Never Skip a Check Plot</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">The pad shapes for the circuit stickers are complex polyline geometries, which Altium, the PCB design software I was using, didn’t handle very gracefully. I discovered the hard way that in Altium, the soldermask layer occasionally disappears for pads with complex geometry. Older versions of my design would contain a soldermask layer, but then upon saving the design file, the layer would silently disappear. This sort of bug is rare, but it does happen. Normally, I’d import the gerber file into a third-party tool as a check plot before making an order, but I was in a rush and reordering an existing design that had worked before, so I skipped the check plot procedure.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The result? Thousands of dollars’ worth of PCBs had to be scrapped, and we lost four weeks from the schedule. Ouch.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It was good that I padded my delivery dates—and that I keep a bottle of fine Scotch on hand, to help bitter reminders of what happens when I get complacent go down a little easier.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec152"><strong>If a Component Can Be Placed Incorrectly, It Will Be</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">I’m paranoid about parts being placed incorrectly, as this problem has burned me many times. The Chibitronics effects sticker sheet was a prime example of the issue waiting to happen.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0268-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>The Chibitronics effects stickers</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_269"/>The sheet is an array of four stickers that flash different patterns on an LED but are otherwise identical. The flashing pattern is controlled by software. Trying to manage four separate firmware files and get them all loaded into the right spot in a tester is a nightmare waiting to happen. To solve that problem, I designed the stickers to use the exact same firmware. Their behaviors were instead set by the value of a single external resistor, which was measured on boot by the microcontroller’s integrated ADC.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">My logic went something like this: if all the stickers have the same firmware, there’s no “wrong way” to program the stickers. Right?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, I also designed the master PCB panels to be perfectly symmetric. You could load the panels into the assembly robot rotated by pi radians, and the assembly program would run flawlessly—except that the resistors setting the firmware behavior would be populated in reverse order compared to the silkscreen labels. Despite having fiducial holes to provide a frame of reference and text on the PCBs in both Chinese and English that is uniquely orienting, this problem actually happened. On the first effect sticker samples, the “heartbeat” sticker was “blinking,” the “twinkle” sticker was “fading,” and vice versa.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Fortunately, the factory very consistently loaded the boards in backward, which is the best case for a problem like this. I rushed a firmware patch (also a risky thing to do) that reversed the interpretation of the resistor values, and had a new set of samples shipped to me in Singapore via FedEx for a sanity check. We also built a secondary test jig to add a manual double-check for correct flashing behavior on the line in China.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The effects sheet problem was solved, but in making that additional test, we discovered another common problem.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec153"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_270"/><strong>Some Concepts Don’t Translate into Chinese Well</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">I wrote instructions in Chinese to describe the difference between fading (a slow blinking pattern) and twinkling (a flickering pattern) to the factory, but it turns out that the Chinese translations for <em>blink</em> and <em>twinkle</em> are similar. <em>Twinkle</em> translates to 闪烁 (“flickering, twinkling”) or 闪耀 (“to glint, to glitter, to sparkle”), and <em>blink</em> translates to 闪闪 (“flickering, sparkling, glittering”) or 闪亮 (“brilliant, shiny, to glisten, to twinkle”).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I always dread writing subjective descriptions for test operators in Chinese, which is part of the reason I try to automate as many tests as possible. As one of my Chinese friends once remarked, Mandarin is a wonderful language for poetry and arts but difficult for precise technical communications.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The challenge, then, was to come up with a bulletproof, cross-cultural explanation of the difference between fading and twinkling, using only simple terms anyone could understand; that is, I had to avoid technical terms like <em>random</em>, <em>frequency</em>, <em>hertz</em>, and <em>periodic</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I sent the factory a video of the different LED patterns, and our factory recommended we use 渐变 (“gradual change”) for <em>fade</em> and 闪烁 (“flickering, twinkling”) for <em>twinkle</em>. I’m still not convinced that was a bulletproof description, but it was superior to any translation I came up with. And, to this day, we are dogged by problems trying to explain to quality control staff the difference between these effects. It turns out that a malfunctioning sticker <em>also</em> makes a pretty good twinkling effect—for a while.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Funnily enough, it was also a challenge for Jie and me to agree upon what a “twinkle” effect should look like. She described our first iteration of the effect as “closer to a lightning storm than twinkling.” We had several long conversations on the topic, followed by demo videos to clarify the desired effect. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_271"/>We basically tweaked code until it looked about right to both of us. Given the difficulty we had describing the effect to each other, it’s no surprise I had trouble accurately describing the effect in Chinese.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec154"><strong>Eliminate Single Points of Failure</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">When we built test jigs, we built two copies of each, even though throughput requirements demanded just one. Why? Because one might fail.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">And guess what: one test jig did fail. I still don’t know why. Thank goodness we built two copies, though, or I’d have had to rush to China on short notice to diagnose why our sole test jig didn’t work.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec155"><strong>Some Last-Minute Changes Are Worth It</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">About six weeks before we finalized our order for the Chibitronics kits with the factory, Jie suggested that we include a stencil of the sticker patterns with the sensor and microcontroller kits. She reasoned that it can be difficult to lay out the copper tape patterns for complex stickers like the microcontroller, which has seven pads, without a drawing of the contact patterns. I originally resisted the idea; I didn’t want to delay shipment on account of something we didn’t originally promise. As Jie discovered, I can be very temperamental, especially when it comes to schedule slips. (Sorry, Jie! Thanks for bearing with me.)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But her arguments were sound, so I instructed our factory to search for a stencil vendor. After two weeks, we hadn’t found anyone willing to take the job, but our factory’s sourcing department didn’t give up. Eventually, they found one vendor who had enough material in stock to tool up a die cutter and turn around a couple thousand stencils within two weeks—just barely in time to meet the schedule.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_272"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0272-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>The sensor and microcontroller sheet and stencil</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When I got samples of the sensor and microcontroller kit with the stencils, I gave them a whirl. Jie was absolutely right about their utility. I found my experience vastly improved when I had a template to work from, particularly for the microcontroller sticker with seven closely spaced pads, and I felt users would agree. That’s how even though the stencil wasn’t promised as part of the original campaign, all backers who ordered the sensor and microcontroller kit received a free stencil to help them lay out designs.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec156"><strong>Chinese New Year Impacts the Supply Chain</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Even though the Chinese New Year is a two-week holiday, our initial schedule essentially wrote off the month of February. Reality matched this expectation, but I want to share with you exactly how Chinese New Year impacted this project, in case you’re considering manufacturing a product in China.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_273"/>We had a draft manuscript of our book ready in January, but I couldn’t get a complete sample until March. That wasn’t because the printer was closed for a month straight; like everyone else, their holiday was about two weeks long. The paper vendor, however, started their holiday about 10 days before the printer, and the binding vendor ended their holiday about 10 days after the printer. Even though each vendor took only two weeks off, the net supply chain for printing a custom book was out for around 24 days, or effectively the entire month of February. The staggered observance of Chinese New Year is necessary because of the sheer magnitude of human migration that accompanies the holiday.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec157"><strong>Shipping Is Expensive and Difficult</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">When I ran the initial numbers on shipping, I realized that we weren’t exactly selling circuit stickers—taking the book into account, by volume and weight, our principal product was printed paper. To optimize logistics cost, I pushed to ship starter kits (which contained a book) and additional stand-alone book orders by ocean, rather than air.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We actually had starter kits and books ready to go almost four weeks before the first kits shipped, but we just couldn’t get a reasonable quotation for the cost of shipping them by ocean. We spent almost three weeks haggling and quoting with ocean freight companies. In the end, their price was basically the same as going by air but would take three weeks longer and incurred more risk. Freight cost is apparently a minor component of shipping by ocean, and you get killed by a multitude of surcharges, from paying the longshoremen to paying all the intermediate brokers and warehouses that handle your goods at the dock. Those fixed costs added up such that even though we were shipping over 60 cartons of goods, air shipping was still more cost-effective.</p>&#13;

<p class="notep"><em>For reference, a Maersk 40-foot sea container would fit over 1,250 cartons, each containing 40 starter kits. We were an order of magnitude away from being able to efficiently utilize ocean freight.</em></p>&#13;

<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec158"><strong>You’re Not Out of the Woods Until You Ship</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">At each milestone in this project, I had to remind myself not to count my chickens before they hatched. Problems ranging from a routine UPS screwup to a tragic aviation accident to a logistics problem at Crowd Supply’s fulfillment depot to a customs problem could stymie an on-time delivery. But, at the very least, we did everything within our power to deliver on time.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Thankfully, when all was said and done, our backers received their orders right on time. Since then, Chibitronics has continued to surpass my wildest expectations. Although we started this project as an academic experiment, grassroots user adoption prompted us to grow the experiment into a full-fledged company. As the circuit stickers are an open hardware project, the specs are available for savvy hackers to play with, but most users are nontechnical folks who would benefit more directly from support on basic usage. To that end, the company strives to provide users with assistance, activities, and more stickers to help them keep learning and making beautiful electronic crafts.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec159"><strong>CLOSING THOUGHTS</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Chibitronics has been an ongoing learning experience for me, as I’ve never had a company successfully mature like this. I’m excited to see where the company goes, but as an engineer, I also know my limitations: I’m not cut out to be a business-person. Once the company is big enough to support its own staff in a sustainable fashion, I’m looking forward to handing over the reins, returning to my workbench, and dreaming up new open hardware inventions.</p>&#13;

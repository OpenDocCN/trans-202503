</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="ChapterIntro">One of the most impactful things a shinobi could do after infiltrating a castle or fortification was start a fire—ideally in or around gunpowder storehouses, wood stores, food or supply depots, or bridges. A well-set fire spread quickly while staying out of sight; could not be contained or extinguished easily; and became an immediate danger to the castle’s integrity, supplies, and inhabitants. Castle defenders were forced to choose between putting out the flames and fighting the enemy army signaled to attack by the <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="132" id="Page_132"/>arsonist. Attempting to fight both battles at once weakened a target’s ability to do either. Those who fought the fire were easily overtaken by the advancing soldiers, while those who ignored the fire to take up arms ultimately lost the battle no matter how well they fought.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c17-noteref-111" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-111">1</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p>The scrolls talk at length about fire attacks, including the various tools, tactics, and skills used to execute them. Before an attack, shinobi studied a castle’s inhabitants to determine when they slept or when key positions went unguarded. They then worked with other invaders to coordinate timing. Shinobi engineered numerous custom tools for these attacks, such as fire arrows, covert fire-holding cylinders, land mines, bombs, and throwable torches.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c17-noteref-112" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-112">2</a></sup> Among the most visually dynamic weapons were “heat horses”—horses with special torches tied to their saddles and set loose to run wildly inside fortifications, spreading fire chaotically, distracting guards and inhabitants, and proving difficult to contain. Amid the confusion, shinobi communicated with forces concealed outside the castle to cue the attack once the fire had sufficiently spread.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c17-noteref-113" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-113">3</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p>While medieval armies had the capability to initiate a fire attack from afar—by deploying archers to shoot fire arrows, for example—<em>Bansenshūkai</em> recommends that commanders employ shinobi to set the fire instead. Compared to external attacks, fires set by shinobi would not be spotted and extinguished as quickly. Also, the shinobi could set them near combustible or strategically valuable items, and an agent could feed them until they grew.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c17-noteref-114" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-114">4</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p>The success of fire attacks made them ubiquitous in feudal Japan, so many castles began implementing targeted countermeasures. These included fireproofing fortifications with <em>dozo-zukuri</em> (“fireproofing with plaster”) or fire-resistant lacquer,<sup class="endnote"><a id="c17-noteref-115" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-115">5</a></sup> building with fireproof or fire-resistant materials such as clay or rock, using fire-resistant roof tiles, establishing fire watch teams, and creating firebreaks by designating inconsequential buildings (i.e., buildings that could be sacrificed to prevent fire from spreading to critical infrastructure).<sup class="endnote"><a id="c17-noteref-116" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-116">6</a></sup> Guards were also warned that fires might be purposeful distractions to facilitate theft, attack, or other actions<sup class="endnote"><a id="c17-noteref-117" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-117">7</a></sup><sup> </sup>(advice later mirrored in the <em>Gunpo Jiyoshu</em> manual<sup class="endnote"><a id="c17-noteref-118" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-118">8</a></sup>). </p>&#13;
<p>It is important to remember that shinobi did not have automatic lighters and that defenders kept a constant lookout for arsonists (much like modern organizations that maintain antivirus and threat detection everywhere). Shinobi engineered ingenious methods to deliver fire covertly, weaponize it, and exploit combustible targets. When imagining how cyberattacks could be delivered and weaponized against targets, keep shinobi ingenuity with fire attacks in mind. </p>&#13;
<p>In this chapter, we will review how, in the context of cyberwar, shinobi fire attacks are surprisingly similar to modern hybrid tactics. Fire is <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="133" id="Page_133"/>a great analogy for wormable/self-propagating cyberattacks, as it spreads to everything it can touch. We will review examples of destructive cyberattacks, as well as how modern adversaries time and coordinate them. We will touch on the various defenses that organizations use to prevent, mitigate, contain, and recover from cyberattacks. Takeaways from this chapter can be applied to firewalls, as well as new, more advanced network defense strategies.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-500549c17-0001">Destructive Cyber Attacks</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Not long after computers were able to connect and communicate with each other, self-propagating viruses and worms were born. Destructive attacks have only gotten more prolific with time. Now, a destructive attack on one organization’s network can quickly spread like fire, destroying systems and data across the internet. Considering the growing interconnectedness of systems in cyberspace as well as inherent security flaws, a network or machine connected to the internet without patches or other safeguards is basically kindling just waiting to be lit.</p>&#13;
<p>In the early 2000s, the industry saw its first ransomware attacks. In these attacks, malware encrypts a system or network’s data (and deletes the backups) until the target pays to unencrypt them. These viruses quickly spread from systems to network storage to the cloud, holding data hostage or, in the case of nonpayment, destroying it through encryption. Like ninja fire attacks, ransomware is often used to distract from bigger gambits. For example, adversaries (believed to be North Korean) deployed the FEIB Hermes ransomware attack to divert cyber defenders’ attention while the attackers executed the SWIFT financial attack, which netted them millions of dollars.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c17-noteref-119" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-119">9</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p>Next came wiper malware attacks, in which the adversary plants “time bomb” viruses in multiple systems to delete all system data and wipe backups at a specified, opportune time. One example is the Shamoon virus, which is believed to have been conducted by Iranian threat actors against Saudi Arabia and was launched at the start of a weekend holiday to destroy data and disable industrial oil systems.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c17-noteref-120" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-120">10</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p>Recently, attackers have deployed sabotage malware against industrial control systems, giving the attackers the capability to read sensors or control mechanical switches, solenoid, or other physical actuators that operate blast furnaces,<sup class="endnote"><a id="c17-noteref-121" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-121">11</a></sup> electrical grids,<sup class="endnote"><a id="c17-noteref-122" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-122">12</a></sup> anti–air defense systems,<sup class="endnote"><a id="c17-noteref-123" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-123">13</a></sup><sup> </sup>and nuclear centrifuges.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c17-noteref-124" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-124">14</a></sup> Such an attack could disable these critical systems or cause them to malfunction, potentially leading to explosions, other physical destruction, or simultaneous kinetic attacks.</p>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="134" id="Page_134"/>Administrative efforts to prevent the spread of attacks include reducing the attack surface by hardening systems so that when systems are attacked, fine-tuned security controls limit the damage. Also useful is resiliency, in which multiple backups of systems and data in other locations and networks give organizations a fallback when a cyberattack successfully compromises the primary systems. (Sometimes these backups are even analog or manual systems.)</p>&#13;
<p>More technical defense solutions include placing firewalls on the perimeter of the network. However, if an attacker bypasses them, infiltrates the network, and starts a self-propagating destructive attack, a firewall may let the attack get outside of its network; in other words, firewalls are typically designed to block incoming attacks, not outgoing attacks. Other efforts to detect and stop destructive attacks include antivirus software, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), host intrusion detection systems (HIDS), and Group Policy Objects (GPO). Such technical safeguards might immediately identify a destructive attack, respond to it, and neutralize it, but they are typically signature based and therefore not always effective.</p>&#13;
<p>A newer approach is cyber insurance, which is an agreement that protects an organization from the legal and financial fallout of a breach. While such an insurance policy may mitigate an organization’s liability in the case of a cyberattack, it does not defend against attacks, just like fire insurance does not defend against flames.</p>&#13;
<p>Arguably the best option for defense against destructive attacks includes strict network segregation and isolation (air gapping) to limit resource access and prevent the spread of a self-propagating virus. While this is an exceptionally effective way to block a cyberattack, it is not always feasible given its potentially high impact on business functions. Also, it can be bypassed by sneakernets and insider threats. </p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-500549c17-0002">Safeguards from (Cyber) Fire Attacks</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">It is common for organizations to procure fire insurance and to pursue fire prevention and containment strategies. However, for whatever reason, some organizations purchase cyber insurance without implementing safeguards against cyberattacks. It may be that they don’t see the same level of risk from cyberattacks as from a real fire where, after all, property and even human life are at stake. But with the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the increasing convergence of the physical world with cyberspace, risks will only increase. Taking the following defensive measures may be immensely helpful to your organization:</p>&#13;
<ol class="decimal">&#13;
<li value="1"><em>Conduct cyber fire drills. </em>Simulate destructive attacks to test backups, failovers, responsiveness, recovery, and the ability to <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="135" id="Page_135"/>“evacuate” data or systems in a timely fashion. This exercise differs from disaster recovery or backup tests in that, rather than an imagined threat scenario, an active simulated threat is interacting with the network. (Take measures such as encrypting data with a known key to ensure that you don’t destroy any data during the exercises.)<p class="ListBody">Netflix runs a perpetual exercise called “Chaos Monkey” that randomly disconnects servers, breaks configurations, and turns off services. The organization is therefore constantly testing that it can smoothly and immediately load balance or fail over to backups without issue. In the event of a real problem, the security team has already designed and tested workable solutions. Netflix has released Chaos Monkey to the public for free, so any organization can use it to improve the ability to detect, resist, respond to, and recover from destructive attacks.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c17-noteref-125" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-125">15</a></sup><sup> </sup></p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li value="2"><em>(Cyber) fireproof systems. </em>Dedicate resources to studying how a selected destructive attack spreads, what it destroys, and what makes your systems vulnerable to it. Implement read-only hard drive adapters that conduct operations in the hard drive buffer, keeping the data locked “behind glass” and incapable of being destroyed because nothing can interact with it in its read-only state. Remove the “combustible” software: applications, libraries, functions, and other system components that are known to spread destructive attacks.<p class="ListBody">A commercial opportunity exists to develop specialized software, hardware, and devices that cyber fireproof systems. These applications could have a large market impact by making servers or data resistant to destructive attacks, or at least slowing or halting their progress.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li value="3"><em>Set cyber firetraps. </em>There is a large market opportunity for creating automated denial and deception “cyber firetraps” that lure adversaries or malicious programs into infinite loops or trigger mechanisms that cause the attack to quarantine, extinguish, or contain itself. One clever, publicly reported defense is to set up folders on network shares with infinitely recursive directories; when malware tries to iterate over folders to find more data, it gets stuck in a never-ending loop.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c17-noteref-126" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-126">16</a></sup> Specialized sensors could be deployed to locate this behavior. They could then either alert incident response teams or trigger a command to kill the process that initiated the infinite directory.</li>&#13;
<li value="4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="136" id="Page_136"/><em>Create dynamic cyber firebreak/cut lines. </em>Cyberattacks spread so easily because systems are typically powered on and connected to each other. While an attack may not be able to directly compromise a given system, it can spread to other, interconnected systems. This is repeatedly demonstrated by the hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of botnets, worms, and other self-spreading malware in cyberspace.<p class="ListBody">While most network segregation and isolation happens through statically designed architecture, IT organizations can implement additional manual and software-based “break” lines. Some organizations have been known to install a master solenoid switch that manually disconnects the organization from the internet. Internal intranet communications continue, but all external network connections immediately disconnect, creating a physical air gap. The need for this capability might seem extreme or unlikely, but in the event of a global “cyber fire,” the organization has the option to quickly and easily break away from the threat without using a fire axe to sever cables.</p>&#13;
<p class="ListBody">A twist on this implementation would see every system, room, floor, and building with its own master switch, allowing security staff to make quick decisions that thwart destructive attacks. Upon hearing of an attack from leadership, staff could quickly download any critical work documents and then flip their switch, segregating their computer from the network and preventing the spread of the attack.</p>&#13;

<h2>Castle Theory Thought Exercise</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Consider the scenario in which you are the ruler of a medieval castle with valuable assets inside. You spend large parts of your fortune fireproofing your castle. You build it from stone, fortify it with all the newest fire defense technologies, and train your guards in how to respond to a fire.</p>&#13;
<p>In what ways are you still vulnerable to fire attack? For instance, how might you protect or move your gunpowder stores? Could you isolate them while satisfying your military advisers, who say that your army cannot defend the castle without ready access to gunpowder? How would you fireproof your food stores without ruining the food? How might you sanitize or filter goods moving through your castle to prevent the circulation of combustible materials? Where would you create firebreaks in your camps, barracks, and other areas of the castle? What firetraps could you design to contain or <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="137" id="Page_137"/>extinguish a spreading fire or to catch the arsonist? Can you design a fire drill exercise that uses real fire to train your soldiers, but without exposing your castle to risk?</p>&#13;

<h2 id="h1-500549c17-0003">Recommended Security Controls and Mitigations</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Where relevant, recommendations are presented with applicable security controls from the NIST 800-53 standard. Each should be evaluated with the concept of fire attacks in mind.</p>&#13;
<ol class="decimal">&#13;
<li value="1">Monitor for indicators of destructive actions within your organization. Prevent tampering of system-monitoring logs, audit events, and sensor data by forwarding data to segmented event collectors. [AU-6: Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting | (7) Permitted Actions; AU-9: Protection of Audit Information; SI-4: System Monitoring]</li>&#13;
<li value="2">Implement network, system, and process segregation/isolation to reduce the ability of destructive attacks to spread across your network. [CA-3: System Interconnections; SC-3: Security Function Isolation; SC-7: Boundary Protection | (21) Isolation of System Components; SC-11: Trusted Path | (1) Logical Isolation; SC-39: Process Isolation]</li>&#13;
<li value="3">Conduct backup tests and resiliency exercises to determine whether recovery mechanisms and fail-safes work as expected. [CP-9: System Backup | (1) Testing for Reliability and Integrity | (2) Test Restoration Using Sampling; CP-10: System Recovery and Reconstitution | (1) Contingency Plan Testing]</li>&#13;
<li value="4">Require dual authorization from qualified, authorized individuals before allowing commands that delete or destroy data. [CP-9: System Backup | (7) Dual Authorization]</li>&#13;
<li value="5">Implement measures to maintain your organization’s security in the event of a destructive attack that causes security systems to fail. For instance, configure firewalls that go offline to block everything rather than allow everything, or configure systems to go into “safe mode” when an attack is detected. [CP-12: Safe Mode; SC-24: Fail in Known State]</li>&#13;
<li value="6">Maintain media transport mechanisms that are safeguarded against destructive attacks. For example, ensure that a hard drive <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="138" id="Page_138"/>containing sensitive data is kept offline, disconnected, and stored in a secure place where a physically destructive attack, such as a real fire, could not compromise it. [MP-5: Media Transport; PE-18: Location of System Components; SC-28: Protection of Information at Rest]</li>&#13;
<li value="7">Before connecting portable media or devices to your organization’s systems or networks, test and scan them for evidence of malicious software. [MP-6: Media Sanitization; SC-41: Port and I/O Device Access]</li>&#13;
<li value="8">Conduct risk assessments to determine which data and systems, if compromised, would most harm your organization. Take advanced precautions with and install special safeguards on those systems and data. [RA-3: Risk Assessment; SA-20: Customized Development of Critical Components]</li>&#13;
<li value="9">Build defenses such as malicious code protections and detonation chambers to look for evidence of destructive attack capabilities. [SC-44: Detonation Chambers; SI-3: Malicious Code Protection] </li>&#13;

<h2 id="h1-500549c17-0004">Debrief</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, we reviewed fire attacks and the various techniques shinobi used to secretly carry flames and weaponize fire. We looked at several high-profile cyberattacks, along with ways to defend against them. We also looked more generally at ways in which cyber threats act like the digital twin of fire attacks. </p>&#13;
<p>In the next chapter, we will discuss in detail how shinobi would communicate and coordinate with external allies to start a fire attack. Shinobi accomplished covert command and control (C2) communication in a multitude of clever ways—ways that parallel methods some malware uses to perform C2 communication.</p>&#13;

    platform for just about any server task. You might have to learn new protocols
    and how to configure new programs, but the underlying operating system is pretty
    much a solved problem. Congratulations! FreeBSD is a wonderful, flexible platform,
    capable of assuming just about any role in your network. To wrap things up, I’d
    like to discuss some other aspects of FreeBSD.

    users, system administrators, documentation writers, and just about anyone interested
    in the system. They come from countries all around the world and have education
    levels ranging from high school to post-doctoral. I personally have had dealings
    with FreeBSD users from every continent and most of the larger islands on Earth.^([1](footnote.xhtml#afterfn1))

    firms. Some are physicians, and some work as clerks in dubious little stores that
    disappear just before the government notices them. At one point, I worked closely
    with a brilliant developer who turned out to be too young to legally drive. Oddly
    enough, time zones are important, but only because they impact the developers’
    ability to communicate with each other. Since most of the community’s interaction
    is online, the only things that represent you are your words and your work. These
    are the people who improve FreeBSD and drive it forward, making it more than a
    collection of ones and zeros and more than just a way to serve websites.

- en: One of the interesting things about the FreeBSD community is that it has developed
    methods for coping with changes in its leadership. Many open source projects have
    a single leader or a small static leadership team. When those people decide to
    move on, the project is probably over. Someone else might branch or fork that
    project, but the original community usually fragments. The people who created
    FreeBSD have mostly moved on to other things, but the community has grown other
    leaders. After five generations of leadership, FreeBSD as a project has demonstrated
    a resilience to leadership changes that is almost unique in the open source world.
    Today’s FreeBSD leaders take a very active interest in their own replacements,
    mentoring and coaching those junior community members who seem most likely to
    become the leaders of the 2020s and and even the 2030s.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This ability to change leadership has kept FreeBSD as a community vital and
    helped it adapt to the world. In 1994, nobody thought an open source project would
    need a Code of Conduct or a process for discussing and managing architectural
    changes. FreeBSD now has both. Where once the Core Team handled all the central
    decisions, Core has delegated many of its responsibilities to more specific groups.
    All organizations change as they grow and mature. Change destroys many organizations,
    but FreeBSD has demonstrated that it can survive and prosper while redefining
    itself.

    repository and at the bar. The original author of the UFS filesystem still hangs
    around. One of FreeBSD’s founders recently rejoined the project. Some people have
    been committers since the founding. And somehow, they’ve let me hang around since
    the mid ‘90s—probably because I’m too large to easily shift against my will, but
    I’ll take it.

    are paid to improve the code by corporations dependent on FreeBSD, such as Dell
    EMC and Netflix. The FreeBSD Foundation hires developers to complete specific
    tasks on a contract basis. Most developers work on FreeBSD as a hobby, either
    so they can program things more correctly than they’re allowed to at their day
    job or so they can do work that interests them. How many of you have completed
    work projects less successfully than you’d like because of outside influences?
    And how many of you have jobs that pay the bills but don’t leave you feeling fulfilled?
    Developing FreeBSD allows people to satisfy both those itches.

    FreeBSD instead. Some write documentation, some design the websites, some just
    lurk in shadowy alleys of the forums and answer user questions. People who can’t
    do anything else test release candidates and snapshots, hunting bugs that crop
    up only in their environments. Many people spend hours and hours working on FreeBSD-related
    matters. Why? I can assure you that the royalties on this book won’t come close
    to compensating me for the time I could spend with my family. I’m a full-time
    writer now, but if I were to chase money, I’d write about Windows, Linux, and
    the latest cockamamie management snake oil. Instead, I’m writing a book about

    posts, “I’d like to help, but I can’t code.” (I’m pretty sure I sent that email
    to the *questions@* mailing list back in 1998 or so.) The standard response to

    can adopt maintainership on ports you need that no longer have maintainers. Keep

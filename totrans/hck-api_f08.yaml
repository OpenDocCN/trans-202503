    make up more than 80 percent of all web traffic. Yet despite their prevalence,
    web application hackers often fail to test them. And these vital business assets
    can be riddled with catastrophic weaknesses.

    they’re designed to expose information to other applications. To compromise an
    organization’s most sensitive data, you may not need to cleverly penetrate the
    perimeter of a network firewall, bypass an advanced antivirus, and release a zero
    day; instead, your task could be as simple as making an API request to the right
    endpoint.

    them for a myriad of weaknesses. We’ll primarily focus on testing the security
    of REST APIs, the most common API format used in web applications, but will cover
    attacking GraphQL APIs as well. You’ll first learn tools and techniques for using
    APIs as intended. Next, you’ll probe them for vulnerabilities and learn how to
    exploit those vulnerabilities. You can then report your findings and help prevent
    the next data breach.

    business, ran the following headline: “The world’s most valuable resource is no
    longer oil, but data.” APIs are digital pipelines that allow a precious commodity
    to flow across the world in the blink of an eye.'

    applications. When, for example, a Python application needs to interact with the
    functionality of a Java app, things can get messy very quickly. By relying on
    APIs, developers can design modular applications that leverage the expertise of
    other applications. For example, they no longer need to create their own custom
    software to implement maps, payment processors, machine-learning algorithms, or
    authentication processes.

    new technologies often get quite a head start before cybersecurity has a chance
    to ask any questions, and APIs have hugely expanded these applications’ attack
    surfaces. They’ve been so poorly defended that attackers can use them as a direct
    route to their data. In addition, many APIs lack the security controls that other
    attack vectors have in place, making them the equivalent of the Death Star’s thermal
    exhaust port: a path to doom and destruction for businesses.'

    the leading attack vector. As hackers, we need to secure them by putting on our
    rollerblades, strapping the Acme rocket to our backs, and catching up to the speed
    of technological innovation. By attacking APIs, reporting our findings, and communicating
    risks to the business, we can do our part to thwart cybercrime.

- en: Attacking APIs is not as challenging as you may think. Once you understand how
    they operate, hacking them is only a matter of issuing the right HTTP requests.
    That said, the tools and techniques typically leveraged to perform bug hunting
    and web application penetration testing do not translate well to APIs. You can’t,
    for instance, throw a generic vulnerability scan at an API and expect useful results.
    I’ve often run these scans against vulnerable APIs only to receive false negatives.
    When APIs are not tested properly, organizations are given a false sense of security
    that leaves them with a risk of being compromised.

    knowledge you need about web applications and the APIs that power them. You’ll
    learn about REST APIs, the main topic of this book, as well as the increasingly
    popular GraphQL API format. I will also cover the most common API-related vulnerabilities
    you can expect to find.'

    API hacking system and develop an understanding of the tools in play, including
    Burp Suite, Postman, and a variety of others. You’ll also set up a lab of vulnerable
    targets you’ll practice attacking throughout this book.'

    and I’ll walk you through performing common attacks against APIs. Here the fun
    begins: you’ll discover APIs through the use of open-source intelligence techniques,
    analyze them to understand their attack surface, and finally dive into various
    attacks against them, such as injections. You’ll learn how to reverse engineer
    an API, bypass its authentication, and fuzz it for a variety of security issues.'

    to showing you how API weaknesses have been exploited in data breaches and bug
    bounties. You’ll learn how hackers have employed the techniques covered throughout
    the book in real-world situations. You’ll also walk through a sample attack against
    a GraphQL API, adapting many of the techniques introduced earlier in the book
    to the GraphQL format.'

    penetration testers and bug bounty hunters looking to add another skill to their
    repertoire. I’ve designed the text so that even beginners can pick up the knowledge
    they’ll need about web applications in Part I, set up their hacking lab in Part
    II, and begin hacking in Part III.

- en: Before we begin, let me leave you with a metaphor. Imagine that an application
    is a restaurant. Like an API’s documentation, the menu describes what sort of
    things you can order. As an intermediary between the customer and the chef, the
    waiter is like the API itself; you can make requests to the waiter based on the
    menu, and the waiter will bring you what you ordered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Crucially, an API user does not need to know how the chef prepares a dish or
    how the backend application operates. Instead, they should be able to follow a
    set of instructions to make a request and receive a corresponding response. Developers
    can then program their applications to fulfill the request however they’d like.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As an API hacker, you’ll be probing every part of the metaphorical restaurant.
    You’ll learn how the restaurant operates. You might attempt to bypass its “bouncer”
    or perhaps provide a stolen authentication token. Also, you’ll analyze the menu
    for ways to trick the API into giving you the data you’re not authorized to access,
    perhaps by tricking the waiter into handing you everything they have. You may
    even convince the API owner into giving you the keys to the whole restaurant.

    I think we might even prevent the next big API data breaches.

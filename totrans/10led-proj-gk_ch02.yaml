    here, a few old *Star Wars* collectible cards there, and sometimes a new gadget
    with no real purpose other than to make sounds. Some I keep around for inspiration
    while writing, and others just add a bit of color and quirkiness to my daily routine.
    If your desk is lacking in unnecessary trinkets, liven it up with your own version
    of the Desktop UFO.

- en: The Desktop UFO is lit by LEDs that provide a nice eerie glow. It has an on/off
    switch to save power and takes up very little space. It consists of a mix of 3D-printed
    components and items you can likely find around the house, as well as a few electronics
    components. Including 3D printing time, the entire project can be completed by
    a beginner in six hours or less.
  prefs: []

- en: If you don’t have access to a 3D printer, don’t worry. A careful examination
    of the Desktop UFO reveals some very basic shapes. A plastic saucer of any kind
    could substitute for the 3D-printed version, and the landing pads can be made
    from plastic or wood or any small, flat objects that can be drilled. It also might
    be worth checking local libraries and maker spaces to see if there’s a 3D printer
    you can use.

    shown in [Figure 2-1](ch02.xhtml#ch02fig1), offered a nice special effect for
    the UFO. The NeoPixel is a strip or ring of LEDs that you can program to light
    up in a pattern, providing a rotating, glowing ring beneath the saucer.

    about 3 inches from the longer length of each straw; you can fine-tune the length
    once you get the UFO assembled, but 3 inches or more should give you enough straw
    to experiment with as you balance the saucer on the legs.

    be drilled with a 3/8-inch drill bit (and you can drill it when you drill the
    on/off hole described earlier). The flexible straws will allow you to bend the
    legs, so you don’t have to be exact with where you drill this hole, but try to
    imagine an equilateral triangle where the landing pads will be glued beneath the
    UFO body and drill a hole for the landing pad that will be farthest from the battery
    box on/off switch.

    Tuck away any exposed wire using tape or a dab of hot glue applied to the underside
    of the UFO body.

    Adafruit’s other specialty LEDs—there are so many variations, you’re likely to
    find something that grabs attention.

    well as prototyping. The final UFO doesn’t have to look perfect; this one has
    its flaws, but it works and looks cool—and that’s good enough for me!

- en: The Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2, shown in [Figure 13-1](ch13.xhtml#ch13fig1),
    features an 8 MP Sony IMX219 image sensor with a fixed-focus lens. It’s capable
    of 3280×2464 pixel static images and supports video with resolutions of 1080p
    at 30 frames, 720p at 60 frames, and 640×480 at 90 frames—all of which means it’s
    a pretty good camera for its size! You’ll just use the static image capabilities
    in this project.

    because it gives users an affordable way to take still photographs and record
    video in full HD. One interesting example of a Camera Module v2 project comes
    from the Naturebytes community, which provides kits to remotely capture wildlife
    photos. [Figure 13-2](ch13.xhtml#ch13fig2) shows the wildlife camera in action.

    picamera library to control the camera. You should be familiar with all the other
    modules used here from previous projects. Then you create objects to refer to
    the pushbutton, the PIR motion sensor, and the camera ➋, and initialize the camera
    with `camera.start_preview()` ➌. Depending on how your camera is oriented, you
    might also need to rotate it 180 degrees with `camera.rotation = 180` so that
    it doesn’t take the photos upside down. If your image is upside down when you
    test this code, go back and set the rotation to `0` or comment out this line.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, you initialize an `i` variable that starts at `0` ➍. The `take_photo()`
    function, defined at ➏, will use this variable to count and number the images,
    incrementing the number in the filename by one with each picture taken.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You then define the `stop_camera()` function that stops the camera with the
    `camera.stop_preview()` method ➎. At ➏, you define the `take_photo()` function
    we just mentioned, which takes a photo. For this, you use the `camera.capture()`
    method, specifying the directory you want to save the image to inside the parentheses.
    In this case, we’re saving the images in the *Desktop* folder and naming the images
    `image_%s.jpg`, where `%s` is replaced with the number we incremented earlier
    in `i`. If you want to save your files to a different folder, replace this directory
    with the path to your chosen folder.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You then impose a 10-second delay ➐, meaning the camera takes photos at 10-second
    intervals for as long as the PIR sensor detects movement. Feel free to increase
    or decrease the delay time, but be careful to not overload the Pi with tons of
    images by making the delay time too small.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At ➑, you define the behavior to trigger the `stop_camera()` function when you
    press the pushbutton. This function stops the camera preview and exits the program.
    The `exit()` function pops up a window asking if you want to close the program;
    to close it, just click **OK**. Finally, you tell the camera to take a photo by
    triggering the `take_photo()` function when motion is detected ➒.

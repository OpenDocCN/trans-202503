<p class="noindent"><span class="big1">THE MAJORITY OF THE PROJECTS IN THIS BOOK ARE WRITTEN IN THE PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, WHICH COMES PREINSTALLED WITH THE RASPBIAN OPERATING SYSTEM. PYTHON IS A FAIRLY SIMPLE LANGUAGE TO LEARN, BECAUSE ITS STRUCTURE MAKES IT EXTREMELY USER-FRIENDLY. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_36"/>BUT IT ALSO HAS COMPLEX FEATURES SUITABLE FOR MORE ADVANCED PROGRAMMERS AND CAN ACCOMPLISH TASKS EFFICIENTLY.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When building the projects in this book, I’ll walk you through writing Python code for each program. As a result, you’ll learn the basics of the language as you complete the projects. Before we get started, we’ll look at some programming basics, such as printing statements, making choices, and avoiding common errors in Python.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec1">EXPLORING PYTHON</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To illustrate Python’s efficiency, imagine you’re writing the classic first program to display <em>Hello World</em> on your screen.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the Java programming language, you would write this code:</p>&#13;
<pre>public class Main {&#13;
    public static void main(String[] args) {&#13;
        System.out.println("Hello World"); &#13;
    }&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">In Python, you can achieve the same output with just a single line of code:</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codepurple">print</span> (<span class="codegreen1">"Hello World"</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Python code is written in an <em>integrated development environment</em> <em>(IDE)</em>. An IDE is the software you use to write Python code, in the same way you might use a word processor to write a document or a web browser to load and view a website.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">INTRODUCING THONNY AND IDLE</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Raspbian operating system comes preinstalled with access to a Python IDE named <em>Thonny</em> (<a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig01">Figure 2-1</a>). This default Python editor includes a wide range of error-detecting and code-highlighting features. If you need to install Thonny manually for any reason, open the terminal and enter this command:</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codegreen">pi@raspberrypi</span>:- <span class="codeblue">$</span> <span class="codestrong1">sudo apt-get install python3-thonny</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">The Thonny IDE has a section for you to write full program code as well as a Shell. The <em>Shell area</em> is where you can write single lines of code and test them without having to save the full program code. You can read more about Thonny’s features at <em><a href="http://thonny.org/">http://thonny.org/</a>.</em></p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_37"/><img alt="Image" src="../images/02fig01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap" id="ch02fig01"><strong>FIGURE 2-1</strong> Thonny, the default Python IDE</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Python has other editors available, including IDLE (pronounced <em>idol</em>), the classic IDE for writing Python code. When you download Python onto something other than Raspbian, say your regular laptop, this is the editor that is supplied.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The program code for each project can be written in any Python editor, but IDLE has been used throughout this book and the code is colored to match it. If you want to use IDLE, open the terminal window and enter this code:</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codegreen">pi@raspberrypi</span>:- <span class="codeblue">$</span> <span class="codestrong1">sudo apt install idle3</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">You’ll find more information and download details at <em><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a></em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you load IDLE, two windows will open (<a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig02">Figure 2-2</a>). The window on the left is the <em>Shell</em> <em>window</em>. You can use this window to test single lines of code: when you write code and press <span class="small">ENTER</span>, the code immediately runs. The <em>Untitled</em> window on the right lets you write and save multiple lines of code or full programs. Then you can return to them whenever you want to.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/02fig02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap" id="ch02fig02"><strong>FIGURE 2-2</strong> IDLE is the classic IDE for writing Python code.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_38"/>Once you’ve written your program, you’ll want to run, or <em>execute</em>, it to test that it works correctly. For both of the installed IDEs, you use the <span class="small">F5</span> key to save and execute a program. Most programmers write and test their programs as they’re developing them to catch and remove errors early in the process.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3">WRITING YOUR FIRST PROGRAM</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Let’s write your first program, which will <em>print</em> a simple message to the screen. From the main menu, select the Programming option, select either Thonny or Python 3 (IDLE), and click <strong>File</strong> ▶ <strong>New</strong>. You can also click <strong>File</strong> ▶ <strong>New File</strong> from IDLE. At the top of your new window, enter this line exactly as shown (although you can change the text between the quotation marks to a message of your own if you want to):</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codepurple">print</span> (<span class="codegreen1">"I can code"</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">To run the program, press <span class="small">F5</span> on your keyboard; you’ll be prompted to save the program. Click <strong>OK</strong>, and the program will save and run. The text <code>I can code</code> will appear in the Shell window.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Return to the previous window, and below your earlier code, enter this line:</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codepurple">print</span> (<span class="codegreen1">"Look a second line!"</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Once again, press <span class="small">F5</span> to save and run the program, which should now look like this:</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codepurple">print</span> (<span class="codegreen1">"I can code"</span>)&#13;
<span class="codepurple">print</span> (<span class="codegreen1">"Look a second line!"</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_39"/>Now that you’ve written your first program, let’s review some Python basics.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">STRINGS</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>Strings</em> are a data type that represents text. You make a string by entering characters inside single or double quotes: either method works as long as you use the same type of quotes at either end of the string.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Inside the quotes, you usually enter text, such as <code>"Welcome to Raspberry Pi Projects for Kids"</code>. You can print a string (display it onscreen), save it, and even manipulate it. You can also search strings for a particular word or character, measure the length of a string, and even replace a section of a string, all by using Python code.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Strings are not just for letters. They can also contain numbers and symbols. For example, the string <code>"C3P0"</code> contains letters and numbers. However, the numbers in a string have no value; they simply represent the symbol for the number 3 and the symbol for the number 0. Even a number by itself, such as <code>"465"</code>, has no value, meaning you can’t use it as a number in your code by, say, adding it to another number.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Try it out: enter the following program, which looks like it should add two numbers:</p>&#13;
<pre>Total = 500 + <span class="codegreen1">"500"</span>&#13;
<span class="codepurple">print</span> (Total)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you run this program, you’ll get an error. It won’t work because the program tries to add one number and one string, and strings don’t have a value. To solve this error, you need to remove the quotation marks from "<code>500</code>", which changes 500 from a string to a number. Both numbers now have a value, so you can add them together. Try running the program now.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec5">VARIABLES</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Some of the programs you’ll write will require the user to enter their own data into the code. Imagine a program that asks a player to input their name. Because this data will change for each user, you can store it in a <em>variable</em>. Think of variables as boxes inside the computer’s memory that hold information. You give each box a label so you can find it again.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_40"/>In Python, you define a variable by first giving it a label, which is known as <em>declaring</em> the variable. For example, let’s use <code>NameOfMyPet</code> as the variable label. Next, you use the equal sign (<code>=</code>) to indicate that the variable contains a string or a value. The technical term for this is <em>assignment</em>, meaning you assign something to the variable. Finally, you state what the variable should contain. For example, the name of my pet is Iron Cat, so I could declare a variable like this: <code>NameOfMyPet = "Iron Cat"</code>. The string "<code>Iron Cat"</code> is now stored in the computer’s memory, and I can retrieve it at any time by calling the variable <code>NameOfMyPet</code>. To print the contents of a variable, use the code <code>print(NameOfMyPet)</code>:</p>&#13;
<pre>NameOfMyPet = <span class="codegreen1">"Iron Cat"</span>  &#13;
<span class="codepurple">print</span>(NameOfMyPet)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can change the contents of the variable by editing the string. For example, you might change the pet name to Tony Bark. When you run the program after the change, the original contents of the variable are overwritten with the new pet name.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>You could use a variable label in lowercase style, such as</em> <span class="codeitalic">nameofmypet</span>. <em>But this is harder to read and understand at a glance. Python programmers use a technique known as</em> camel case<em>: a capital letter indicates the first letter of each new word in the variable label (for example,</em> <span class="codeitalic">NameOfMyPet</span><em>).</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can also use variables to store user responses to questions, such as “What is your name?”.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To create a variable to store user input, you begin by declaring the variable. Then you use the equal sign (<code>=</code>) and add the question that you want answered or a prompt within parentheses on the other side of the equal sign. Delete the contents in your IDLE or Thonny file, and enter the following:</p>&#13;
<pre>name = <span class="codepurple">input</span>(<span class="codegreen1">"What is your name? "</span>)&#13;
<span class="codepurple">print</span> (<span class="codegreen1">"Welcome "</span>, name)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">The program stores the name that the user enters in a variable called <code>name</code>. When you run the program, it retrieves the name from the variable <code>name</code>, combines it with the word <code>Welcome</code>, and prints that on the bottom line. For instance, if your name was Sarah, it would print <code>Welcome Sarah</code>. You may notice that there is a deliberate space after <code>What is your name?</code> and <code>Welcome</code>. This ensures that words are separated by spaces. Otherwise, it will print something like this: <code>WelcomeSarah.</code></p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec6">LOOPS</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In some of the projects in this book, you’ll need your program to continuously repeat a set of instructions. For instance, in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_41"/>the program needs to constantly check the level of light in the room to know when to trigger your hot glue night-light to turn on, meaning the code needs to keep running again and again. In <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06">Chapter 6</a>, the trampoline program continuously checks whether you’re standing on a block of grass in Minecraft. If you are, it’s trampoline time, and you’re sent springing up into the air!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This programming technique is more commonly known as <em>looping</em>. The two types of loops are <code>while</code> loops and <code>for</code> loops.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">while Loops</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A <code>while</code> loop continues to repeat its code while a particular condition is met. The following example shows how you might use this loop:</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="ent">❶</span> count = 5&#13;
<span class="ent">❷</span> <span class="codeorg">while</span> count &gt; 0:&#13;
      question = <span class="codepurple">input</span>(<span class="codegreen1">"Do you like cheese? (yes or no) "</span>)&#13;
    <span class="ent">❸</span> print (<span class="codegreen1">""</span>)&#13;
    <span class="ent">❹</span> count = count - 1	</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">You set the value of the <code>count</code> variable to 5 <span class="ent">❶</span> to begin with. While the value in <code>count</code> is greater than 0 <span class="ent">❷</span>, the program asks the question <code>"Do you like cheese? (yes or no) "</code>. Then it prints a blank line <span class="ent">❸</span> to keep the layout looking neat and tidy. Each time the program loops—meaning each time the indented code after the <code>while</code> loop line <span class="ent">❷</span> runs—it subtracts 1 from the <code>count</code> value in the code <code>count = count – 1</code> <span class="ent">❹</span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After the first time the loop runs, the new <code>count</code> value is set to 4. Because 4 is still bigger than 0, the loop runs again and, at the end of the loop, another 1 is subtracted. The program continues to loop until <code>count</code> reaches a value of 0. Then the loop stops, and the program ends. So this program will run five times and then stop. Notice that the lines at <span class="ent">❸</span> and <span class="ent">❹</span> are indented. Indentation indicates to the program that these three lines are part of the loop and run only while the loop is running.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you use a <code>while True</code> statement, as shown here, the program will keep running until the user stops or closes the program:</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codeorg">while True</span>:&#13;
    question = <span class="codepurple">input</span>(<span class="codegreen1">"Do you like cheese? (yes or no) "</span>)&#13;
    <span class="codepurple">print</span> (<span class="codegreen1">""</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Try it and you’ll be asked “Do you like cheese?” for eternity (well, at least until you exit the program).</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_42"/>for Loops</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A <code>for</code> loop repeats its lines of code for a set number of times. In this example, the <code>range</code> value is set to 5, which means you’ll be asked whether you like cheese five times and then the loop will stop:</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codeorg">for</span> x <span class="codeorg">in</span> <span class="codepurple">range</span>(5):&#13;
    question = <span class="codepurple">input</span>(<span class="codegreen1">"Do you like cheese? (yes or no) "</span>)&#13;
    <span class="codepurple">print</span> (<span class="codegreen1">""</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notice that the <code>for</code> loop accomplishes the same task as the first <code>while</code> loop we created earlier. But it uses less code, making the program simpler and more efficient.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec7">CONDITIONALS</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>Conditionals</em> in Python let your program make decisions: when <em>this</em> is true, <em>this</em> happens, but when <em>that</em> is true, <em>that</em> happens. Think of conditionals like buttons: when you press one button, it makes a sound, but when you press another button, it flashes a light.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Conditionals let your code respond differently to various inputs or outputs. You create conditionals by using <code>if</code>, <code>elif</code>, and <code>else</code> statements.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">An <code>if</code> statement is the start of the conditional and checks whether the first condition has been met. For example, <em>if</em> button A is pressed, play sound A.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If the first condition isn’t met, you can then check for conditions by using an <code>elif</code> statement, short for <em>else if</em>. This statement checks for the next choice if the previous choice wasn’t selected. In this example, if button A was not pressed, it might check whether button B was pressed. You can add as many <code>elif</code> statements as your program needs, checking for buttons C, D, and so on.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The last part of the conditional is the <code>else</code> statement. This tells the program what to do if none of the other conditions are met; in this example, if none of the buttons are pressed, the code in the <code>else</code> statement runs.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Consider the following program to see how conditionals work:</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codeorg">while True</span>:&#13;
 <span class="ent">❶</span> question = <span class="codepurple">input</span>(<span class="codegreen1">"Do you like cheese? (yes or no) "</span>)&#13;
    <span class="codepurple">print</span> (<span class="codegreen1">""</span>)&#13;
 <span class="ent">❷</span> <span class="codeorg">if</span> question == <span class="codegreen1">"yes"</span>:&#13;
       <span class="codepurple">print</span> (<span class="codegreen1">"Good choice"</span>)&#13;
 <span class="ent">❸</span> <span class="codeorg">elif</span> question == <span class="codegreen1">"no"</span>:&#13;
       <span class="codepurple">print</span> (<span class="codegreen1">"shame, I have lots spare"</span>)&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_43"/> <span class="ent">❹</span> <span class="codeorg">else</span>:&#13;
        <span class="codepurple">print</span> (<span class="codegreen1">"Did you answer correctly?"</span>)&#13;
        <span class="codepurple">print</span> (<span class="codegreen1">""</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">You begin by asking the user whether they like cheese <span class="ent">❶</span>. The user enters a response. You then use an <code>if</code> statement <span class="ent">❷</span> to check whether the user’s response is <code>yes</code>. If it is, the program prints the message <code>Good choice</code>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If the user didn’t enter <code>yes</code>, the program skips to the <code>elif</code> statement <span class="ent">❸</span> to check whether the user said <code>no</code>. If they did, an alternative message is printed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Finally, you use an <code>else</code> statement <span class="ent">❹</span> to respond to any answer that isn’t <code>yes</code> or <code>no</code>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Enter the program and run it. You might want to try making your own examples.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec8">FUNCTIONS</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A <em>function</em> is a useful way to store multiple lines of code that perform a single task, like a set of instructions. Then, when you want to do that task elsewhere in your code, you just enter the function name rather than type all the code again.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To create a function, you enter <code>def</code> followed by the name of the function, a pair of empty parentheses, and a colon (the colon is very important!). Then press <span class="small">ENTER</span> to move to the next line so you can type the instructions that the function will run. Notice that when you press <span class="small">ENTER</span>, the cursor appears indented, not at the start of the line. As with loops, code lines that belong to a function need to be indented so Python knows they belong to the function.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To run the function at any point in the program, you write the function’s name followed by the empty parentheses. This is known as <em>calling</em> a function, as shown in the following example:</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codeorg">def</span> <span class="codeblue1">PocketMoney</span>():&#13;
    money = good_behavior * rate&#13;
    tax = (good_behavior  / 100) * 20&#13;
    <span class="codepurple">print</span> (money)&#13;
    <span class="codepurple">print</span> (tax)&#13;
good_behavior = <span class="codepurple">int</span>(<span class="codepurple">input</span>(<span class="codegreen1">"Please enter the number of days you were</span>&#13;
<span class="codegreen1">good "</span>))&#13;
rate = <span class="codepurple">float</span>(<span class="codepurple">input</span>(<span class="codegreen1">"Please enter your pocket money rate "</span> ))</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">You begin by defining a function named <code>PocketMoney()</code>. The indented lines following the function definition calculate the amount <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_44"/>of pocket money the user gets paid and how much they owe for “tax” based on information that the user inputs.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you ran this program now, it wouldn’t do anything because you haven’t <em>called</em> the function; you’ve just defined it. The completed program, including the function call, looks like this:</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codeorg">def</span> <span class="codeblue1">PocketMoney</span>():&#13;
    money = good_behavior * rate&#13;
    tax = (good_behavior  / 100) * 20&#13;
    <span class="codepurple">print</span> (money)&#13;
    <span class="codepurple">print</span> (tax)&#13;
good_behavior = <span class="codepurple">int</span>(<span class="codepurple">input</span>(<span class="codegreen1">"Please enter the number of days you were</span>&#13;
<span class="codegreen1">good "</span>))&#13;
rate = <span class="codepurple">float</span>(<span class="codepurple">input</span>(<span class="codegreen1">"Please enter your pocket money rate "</span> ))&#13;
PocketMoney()</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now the program will ask the user to enter the number of days they were well-behaved and how much pocket money they were paid per day. Then it calculates and prints the user’s final amount of pocket money minus an amount for tax!</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec9">RUNNING PYTHON CODE FROM THE TERMINAL</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Sometimes, you’ll need to run a program from somewhere other than IDLE or Thonny. For example, you might run a program remotely from another computer, or you might not have a screen attached to your Raspberry Pi (as in the nature box project in <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>). In such cases, you can run programs from the terminal. Doing so frees up the processor, RAM, and graphics for the Python program.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To run a program from the terminal, open the terminal and use it to navigate to the folder that holds the program you want to run. Then enter the following command:</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codegreen">pi@raspberrypi</span>:- <span class="codeblue">$</span> <span class="codestrong1">sudo python3</span> <span class="codestrongi">name_of_the_program.py</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Replace <span class="codeitalic">name_of_the_program.py</span> with the name of your Python program, and it will run!</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>When I show code that you should run in the terminal, I’ll precede it with the prompt, which looks like this:</em> <span class="codeitalic">pi@raspberrypi:- $</span>. <em>But you need to enter only the commands that come after the prompt, not the actual prompt.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec10">COMMON PROGRAMMING MISTAKES</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Programmers love to say that programming is 20 percent coding and 80 percent <em>debugging</em>, which is the term for correcting errors in your code. The word <em>bug</em> dates back to the days when computers were so big that they filled several rooms. The story goes that on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_45"/>September 9, 1947, a now famous programmer by the name of Grace Hopper realized that the computer had stopped working. When she inspected the computer, she discovered that a moth had gotten trapped between some of the moving parts. Hopper subsequently stuck the moth in her log book and wrote, “case of bug being found.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Errors, bugs, and mistakes will cause your program to run incorrectly, stall, or not even start. Adopting a methodical, line-by-line approach to debugging will make the process easier. But be prepared to spend a lot of time looking for one small error. Hopefully, you won’t find a moth.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Many common mistakes are syntax issues. <em>Syntax</em> is a set of rules that govern how you must write your code. For example, a line of code inside a conditional must always end with a colon. Different programming languages use different syntax. When presented with errors, first check that you used the correct syntax. Two common syntax issues are the misuse of letter case and indentation.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3">Capital Letters</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">One of the most common syntax errors is using uppercase and lowercase letters incorrectly. Programming languages don’t always follow standard English grammar rules. Some lines of code begin with a lowercase letter, and sometimes a word might appear to have a random capital letter in the middle of it. Python is sensitive to the use of capital letters! Don’t try to correct what might look like a mistake but isn’t; you must enter the code in this book exactly as it’s shown.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, consider the following two lines of code:</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codepurple">Print</span> (<span class="codegreen1">"Hello there"</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">and</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codepurple">print</span> (<span class="codegreen1">"hello there"</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Only one of them works. Which do you think it is? Try them both to see whether you’re right.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4">Indentation</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Another common cause of error is <em>indentation</em>—the number of spaces at the beginning of a line of code. In general, it doesn’t matter how many spaces you use to indent your lines in Python, as long as you’re consistent. A good practice is to always leave four spaces, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_46"/>or one tab, for each indentation. You can use either, but ensure that you’re consistent and use only one method in your program. Don’t use both methods in the same program. As an example of correct indentation, consider this code snippet from the next chapter:</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codeorg">while</span> <span class="codeorg">True</span>:&#13;
 <span class="ent">❶</span> <span class="codepurple">print</span>(ldr.value)&#13;

<p class="indent">The lines at <span class="ent">❶</span>, <span class="ent">❷</span>, <span class="ent">❸</span>, and <span class="ent">❻</span> are aligned. So are the lines at <span class="ent">❹</span>, <span class="ent">❺</span>, and <span class="ent">❼</span>. This program code is indented properly, so it will run.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Recall that you need to indent code lines when you’re using conditionals and loops and when you’re defining functions. More generally, anytime a line ends in a colon, the following line or lines must be indented. If your indentations don’t align properly, your program will fail and produce an error message, as shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig03">Figure 2-3</a>.</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap" id="ch02fig03"><strong>FIGURE 2-3</strong> If your code contains a syntax error, it will produce an error message like this one.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, this program has indentation errors:</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codeorg">while True</span>:&#13;
     <span class="codepurple">print</span>(ldr.value)&#13;
     time.sleep(2)&#13;
 <span class="ent">❶</span> <span class="codeorg">if</span> ldr.value &lt;= 0.4:&#13;
     <span class="codepurple">print</span>(<span class="codegreen1">"light on"</span>)&#13;
            led.on()&#13;
        <span class="codeorg">else</span>:&#13;
               led.off()</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Can you figure out which lines are incorrectly indented and will cause an error?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you want an event to happen outside a loop or after a conditional, the code must be <em>dedented</em>, or realigned in line with the code before the start of the loop or conditional. For example, if you <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_47"/>added a <code>print</code> statement at the end, but it was in line with the <code>if</code> statement <span class="ent">❶</span>, the <code>if</code> statement would also run this <code>print</code> command.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec11">USING COMMENTS</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When you finish a program and you look back at it later, you might find sections of the coding confusing, even though you wrote it. To help you and others understand what your code does, you can use comments. A <em>comment</em> is a note that gives the reader information about a section of code.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Python provides two methods for adding comments. The first is to use the hash mark (<code>#</code>). Usually, you’ll use one hash mark in front of the comment, like this:</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codepurple">print</span> (<span class="codegreen1">"hello"</span>) <span class="codered"># this is a comment</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">The second way to create comments is to use three single quote marks to open a comment and three to close it, like this:</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codepurple">print</span> (<span class="codegreen1">"hello"</span>) <span class="codegreen1">'''this is also a comment'''</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Remember that comments aren’t commands; they won’t execute when you run the program. Their only purpose is to provide a description and reminder of what the code does. So, which comment method should you use? If the comment is a single line, use the <code>#</code> option. If the comment spans more than one line, use the ''' method.</p>&#13;

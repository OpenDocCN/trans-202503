<p>Decades- or even centuries-old encrypted messages are far from unusual. Countless encrypted diaries, letters, notebooks, radio messages, newspaper ads, and telegrams are known to exist—not to mention numerous encrypted postcards, such as the one in <a href="#figure1-1">Figure 1-1</a>. Encrypted documents can also be found in archives, private collections, and flea markets, as well as on internet auction portals, websites, and mailing lists. Many more encrypted messages are printed in books, newspapers, and magazines, both old and new.</p>
<p>Before computers became popular, encryption was mainly performed by hand, usually with pencil and paper (hence the term <em>pencil-and-paper encryption</em>). Sometimes, cryptographers also employed simple equipment such as leather strips or wooden and metallic implements, like disks or slides. Starting <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_3" title="3"/>in the late 1920s, mechanical and electrical encryption machines came into use, the most famous of which was the German Enigma machine (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 15"><a href="c15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a></span>). As encryption machines were expensive, they saw widespread use primarily in the military, intelligence organizations, and diplomatic services. Those with fewer financial resources tended to continue using pencil-and-paper systems.</p>
<p>With the advent of modern digital technology around 1970, commercial and military encryption began using computer hardware and software. Nevertheless, pencil-and-paper encryption endured and is still relevant today. It is used by a wide cross section of the population: criminals protecting illegal activities, friends and lovers exchanging secret messages, and others who use it in various recreational activities. For example, geocachers, escape room aficionados, and those involved with other kinds of high-tech scavenger hunts might use cryptography to hide latitude and longitude coordinates.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">We will show you historical examples of real messages, such as postcards, diaries, letters, and telegrams, that were encrypted with pencil and paper or other manual methods. We will also teach you methods for breaking them. Although manual encryption and decryption have lost much of their importance due to the widespread use of computer technology, many people are still interested in deciphering encrypted messages for several reasons:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Families may want to read encrypted postcards, letters, or diaries they have inherited from their ancestors.</li>
<li>Historians endeavor to decipher encrypted documents they have encountered during their research in order to gain insight into previous eras.</li>
<li>Police officers may want to break enciphered messages written by criminals.</li>
<li>Geocachers want to solve puzzle caches.</li>
<li>Decryption enthusiasts take delight in deciphering encrypted documents that were created decades or even centuries ago; many of these enthusiasts regard solving an unsolved cipher to be as exciting a task as climbing Mount Everest or making a new archaeological discovery.</li>
<li>Students try to solve challenges from their cryptography classes. Most classes focus on computer-based encryption, but they usually include the study of pencil-and-paper methods as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>While some solvers are mainly interested in historical encrypted messages, others enjoy encryption puzzles created as recreation, like those found in Elonka’s book <em>The Mammoth Book of Secret Codes and Cryptograms</em><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c01-endnote-2" id="c01-noteref-2">2</a></sup> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_4" title="4"/>or in the regular publications of the American Cryptogram Association. This book mainly deals with historical encryption. The postcard from 1904 shown at the beginning of this chapter is the first example we provide. In <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 5"><a href="c05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a></span>, we will explain how it can be deciphered.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502727c01-0002"><a class="XrefDestination" id="WhichtechnicaltermsdoIneedtoknow?"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c01-004"/>Which technical terms do I need to know?</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">A text that is to be encrypted is termed a <em>plaintext</em>. The result of an encryption is the <em>ciphertext</em>. Sometimes, the ciphertext may be embedded in other readable text, which is called the <em>cleartext </em>to distinguish it from the ciphertext that appears within it.</p>
<p>Many encryption methods are based on some secret information that may only be known to the sender and the receiver—the <em>key</em>. A typical example of a key is a <em>substitution table</em> that replaces every letter of the alphabet for another one. Sometimes, the key is represented by a word, the <em>keyword</em>.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of encryption methods: ciphers and codes. The easiest way to describe the difference is that a <em>cipher</em> (sometimes spelled “cypher”) generally works on letters, while a <em>code </em>works on words or phrases. The problem with using a code is that you often need to first think of nearly every word you want to use and then generate a codebook that has an equivalent for each one. Since a language can have thousands of words, such codebooks could be quite large! But a cipher, which operates only on letters, can be a much more compact system. Pretty much anything can be encrypted with a cipher, as long as both the sender and receiver know the system; no hefty codebook is required. Most of the encryption methods covered in this book are ciphers. Codes will be addressed in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 7"><a href="c07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a></span>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these terms can be confusing because many other meanings of the term <em>code</em> are in general use. For instance, a ZIP code or a code of conduct has nothing to do with encryption. Even if we restrict ourselves to the field of encryption technology, the use of the word <em>code</em> is ambiguous, as it sometimes refers to encryption in general (for example, in the expression <em>codebreaking</em>). Even professional cryptographers, when speaking casually, may use the terms <em>code</em> and <em>cipher</em> interchangeably. In this book, we will use the term <em>code</em> only in the way we defined it in the previous paragraph (i.e., as a method of encrypting messages at the level of words and phrases). There is only one exception: when we say <em>codebreaking</em>, we refer to all kinds of encryption, not only codes.</p>
<p>If we have the key, we can <em>decrypt</em> a ciphertext to obtain the plaintext. If we try to derive a plaintext from a ciphertext without knowing the key, we usually speak of <em>breaking</em> the encryption. An encrypted message we want to break we refer to as a <em>cryptogram</em>.</p>
<p>While the art and craft of encryption is referred to as <em>cryptography</em>, the breaking of cryptograms is called <em>cryptanalysis</em>. <em>Codebreaking</em> is another word for cryptanalysis. Also, the term <em>cryptology</em> often means cryptography and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_5" title="5"/>cryptanalysis but can also mean the study of everything encryption related, including people, machines, systems, and history. The term <em>crypto</em> can be used as a catchall term to apply to many items on this list.</p>
<p>Generally, <em>cryptology</em> refers to messages that are encrypted, but sometimes, <em>steganography</em>, the hiding of information (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 15"><a href="c15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a></span>), is included in cryptology as well.</p>
<p>When breaking a cryptogram, it is usually helpful to know or to guess a word or phrase that appears in the plaintext. Such a word or phrase is called a <em>crib</em>.</p>
<p>In addition, several characters are frequently referenced in the literature on cryptography (though they don’t play a major role in this book): <em>Alice </em>and <em>Bob</em> are often used as placeholder names when it comes to explaining encryption methods. Usually, the sender of an encrypted message is referred to as Alice and the receiver is referred to as Bob. Sometimes, additional characters appear, such as <em>Carol</em> (another crypto user), <em>Eve</em> (an eavesdropper), and <em>Mallory</em> (a malicious person). These characters do not necessarily stand for humans; they might also refer to computer programs or hardware components.</p>
<p>See the glossary in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix C">Appendix C</span> for definitions of these and other terms.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502727c01-0003"><a class="XrefDestination" id="HowcanIbreakanencryptedtext?"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c01-005"/>How can I break an encrypted text?</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">You’ve come to the right place! The purpose of our book is exactly to help you with this question, especially in regard to classical ciphers. We introduce the main pencil-and-paper encryption techniques encountered in practice and then describe how to solve them.</p>
<p>For impatient readers, we provide our first codebreaking example in the following cryptogram: an encrypted advertisement published in the London newspaper <em>The Times</em> on August 1, 1873. This and some other encrypted newspaper ads we will be referring to later are from Jean Palmer’s 2005 book <em>The Agony</em> <em>Column Codes &amp; Ciphers</em>. (Jean Palmer is a pen name of London-based codebreaking expert Tony Gaffney.)<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c01-endnote-3" id="c01-noteref-3">3</a></sup></p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="94" src="image_fi/502727c01/g01002.png" width="694"/></figure>
<p>Here’s the ciphertext written in a more readable way:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>HFOBWDS wtbsfdoesksjd ji ijs mjiae (dai ditwy). Afods ks rofed dpficqp licqp. Toeqfwus yic lsrd vspojt uwjjid qsd ibsf. Aoll sjtswbicf di edwy apsfs yic lsrd ce doll O pswf rfik yic, qobs yicf wtbous. Yicf cjpwhhy aors jid asll.</code></p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_6" title="6"/>A good first step in codebreaking is to count the letters in the message. This technique, called <em>frequency analysis</em>, lets us make educated guesses about what each letter represents, based on how often it appears in the text:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="131" src="image_fi/502727c01/g01003.png" width="694"/></figure>
<p>As can be seen, the ciphertext letter <code>s</code> is the most frequent. It probably stands for the plaintext letter <code class="bold">e</code>, which is the most frequent letter in virtually every English text. After <code class="bold">e</code>, the letters <code class="bold">t</code>, <code class="bold">a</code>, and <code class="bold">o</code> are the next most frequent ones in the English language, although it is difficult to identify these based on their frequencies alone. However, there is another letter we can easily guess by looking at the ciphertext: the word <code>O</code> must stand for <code class="bold">I</code>, as there is no other word in the English language that consists of only one capitalized letter (unless it is at the beginning of a sentence, in which case, the letter <code class="bold">A</code> would fit).</p>
<p>Further analysis shows that the ciphertext contains the word <code>yic</code> three times and the word <code>yicf</code> twice. The plaintext words <code class="bold">the</code> and <code class="bold">them</code> would be good guesses, but we’ve already determined that <code>s</code> (not <code>c</code>) stands for <code class="bold">e</code>. So, <code class="bold">you</code> and <code class="bold">your</code> make sense.</p>
<p>Knowing the ciphertext equivalents of the six plaintext letters <code class="bold">e</code>, <code class="bold">i</code>, <code class="bold">y</code>, <code class="bold">o</code>, <code class="bold">u</code>, and <code class="bold">r</code> makes it easy to guess more words. For instance, <code>ijs</code> decrypts to <code class="bold">o*e</code> (with the asterisk standing for an unknown letter), which likely means <code class="bold">one</code>. In the end, we receive the following plaintext:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>PRIVATE advertisement no one knows (two today). Write me first through lough. Disgrace you left behind cannot get over. Will endeavour to stay where you left us till I hear from you, give your advice. Your unhappy wife not well.</code></p>
<p>If we have access to a computer and a program such as CrypTool 2 (free open source software available at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://cryptool.org">https://cryptool.org</a>), we can use an even more efficient method to break the encrypted advertisement in <em>The Times</em>: we look for a word in the ciphertext that has a distinctive letter pattern. The best candidate we can find is <code>wtbsfdoesksjd</code>—it contains the same letter (<code>s</code>) at the fourth, ninth, and eleventh position, and the sixth and the last letter (<code>d</code>) are the same, too. All other letters in this word are different. CrypTool 2 provides a tool that searches for words with a given repetition pattern in a large database. For <code>wtbsfdoesksjd</code>, we receive only one hit: <code class="bold">advertisement</code>. This is certainly a common word in a newspaper ad.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_7" title="7"/><figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="keyline" height="158" src="image_fi/502727c01/g01004.png" width="694"/></figure>
<p>Assuming that <code class="bold">advertisement</code> is correct, we can determine the meaning of the following letters:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Plaintext:  </code><code class="bold">a d e i m n r s t v</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Ciphertext: w t s o k j f e d b</code></p>
<p>This information enables us to identify or guess more words. For instance, the first word, <code>HFOBWDS</code>, represents <code class="bold">*R*VATE</code>, which can be solved as <code class="bold">PRIVATE</code>. Now we know that the ciphertext letters <code>H</code> and <code>O</code> stand for <code class="bold">P</code> and <code class="bold">I</code>. The ciphertext <code>wtbous</code> decrypts to <code class="bold">advi*e</code>, which should be <code class="bold">advice</code>. (It can’t be <code class="bold">advise</code>, as the <code class="bold">s</code> is already attributed to another letter.) This also shows that ciphertext <code>u</code> corresponds to plaintext <code class="bold">c</code>. We have identified enough letters now that we should be able to decipher more words. In the end, we get the plaintext given above.</p>
<p>This advertisement appears to be a message from a woman to her husband, who has left her. We will probably never learn who created it and why—after all, this ad was published 150 years ago. However, from a codebreaker’s point of view, the mystery is solved.</p>
<p>That was not very difficult, was it? In the course of this book, you will get to know more complicated encryption methods, along with more sophisticated techniques for breaking them.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502727c01-0004"><a class="XrefDestination" id="HowdoIknowwhatkindofencryptionIamdealingwith?"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c01-006"/>How do I know what kind of encryption I am dealing with?</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Breaking a ciphertext usually requires knowing what kind of encryption method has been used. In addition to cipher-breaking methods, we therefore introduce in this book several cipher-detecting techniques. Identifying the cipher in use can be quite simple or very difficult. It is helpful to know that most messages encountered in practice have been encrypted with one of about a dozen methods that can usually be distinguished from each other with some analysis.</p>
<p>If you want to identify a particular cipher without reading the whole book, the following paragraphs will give you some guidance.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Maybe! Did you find an encrypted postcard from your great-grandfather? Did you purchase an encrypted notebook at a flea market? Do you still own <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_11" title="11"/>a cipher message your best friend sent you back in your childhood days? If so, you can try to break the message with one of the techniques described in this book.</p>
<p>If you are not successful, or if you simply do not want to invest the time to solve a cryptogram yourself, feel free to send it to us. (Our email addresses are in the <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_“I have a comment”">“I have a comment”</span> section at the end of this chapter.) Of course, we can’t investigate every crypto mystery we receive, but in many cases, we can help. We are particularly interested in historical examples, less so in systems someone has invented in the modern day. Klaus is always searching for interesting encrypted texts he can write about, and Elonka has a website for famous unsolved codes. We don’t guarantee anything, let alone that your mystery will be solved, but we will at least look at it.</p>
<p>If you send us a cryptogram you have found, please provide the following information:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Tell us what you know about the cryptogram’s background. Where did you find it? Who created it? Do you have any other information, such as the time period when it was created? Was it sent to or from someone you know? Which languages did this person speak? Information of this kind can be extremely helpful for a codebreaker.</li>
<li>Tell us if we may publish this cryptogram (such as on the internet or in a book like this) or if you want to keep it confidential. Of course, we won’t publish anything without the consent of the sender.</li>
<li>In case you allow us to publish a cryptogram, tell us if you would like credit for it and/or if we may mention your name.</li>

<p class="BodyFirst">While we are always very interested in genuine historical and classical ciphers, we generally cannot help with newer items. This is in large part because of the quantity of mail that we get; plus, it is far too easy for someone to compile a bunch of random text and proclaim, “Break my code!”</p>
<p>We make exceptions when a particular cipher has been drawing a great deal of public interest. For instance, if an encrypted message is presented in an artwork, as an inscription on a building, on a gravestone, or in some other unusual way, it might be intriguing to a larger audience. In addition, offering a cash reward or some other prize for solving a crypto puzzle is a good way to make a new puzzle more attractive. We might also take interest in crypto challenges published by the NSA or another organization with a relationship to codebreaking.</p>
<p>If you like to design encryption challenges, we recommend joining the American Cryptogram Association, which is always looking for people to craft puzzles for their regular newsletter. You may also wish to visit the crypto puzzle platform MysteryTwister (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://mysterytwister.org">https://mysterytwister.org</a>) and submit a challenge.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Like everyone who has a certain level of prominence on the crypto scene, we often receive communications from people who have invented their own encryption method and want us to review or crack it. To be honest, we have never been sent such a system that was solid or seemed a good use of our time, so in all seriousness, it is probably not a good idea to do this.</p>
<p>If you have created a method that is related to one of the many manual ciphers we cover in this book, it is likely very crackable, as there are many methods, especially with modern computers, to take these apart. New ciphers must compete with state-of-the-art crypto algorithms such as AES, Diffie-Hellman, and RSA (which are not within the scope of this book). Designing an encryption algorithm that can play in the big leagues is a difficult task, and even highly trained experts usually need several years of effort to create a good encryption algorithm.</p>
<p>So, if you are new to the field of encryption technology and really want to design a new system, we recommend first getting a good cryptography book and studying encryption algorithms that already exist. For example, <em>CryptoSchool</em> (2015) by Joachim von zur Gathen<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c01-endnote-9" id="c01-noteref-9">9</a></sup> is a comprehensive introduction, while <em>Serious Cryptography</em> (2017), written by Jean-Philippe Aumasson,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c01-endnote-10" id="c01-noteref-10">10</a></sup> is a shorter alternative. If you can read German, you should try Klaus’s book <em>Kryptografie—Verfahren, Protokolle, Infrastrukturen</em> (2016).<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c01-endnote-11" id="c01-noteref-11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>For a related opinion on this phenomenon of crypto experts continually receiving examples of crackable systems, we strongly recommend Bruce Schneier’s 1998 essay “Memo to the Amateur Cipher Designer.”<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c01-endnote-12" id="c01-noteref-12">12</a></sup> It’s over two decades old but still relevant. In a nutshell, Schneier says (and we agree) that to attempt to create a new cipher system, it is first essential to have substantial experience in breaking existing systems.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">In this book, we introduce dozens of unsolved cryptograms. Some of them, such as the Voynich manuscript, are quite famous, while others, such as the cigarette case cryptogram, have not received much attention yet. (Both of these cryptograms can be seen in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 5"><a href="c05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a></span>.) A list of famous cryptograms is available on Elonka’s website,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c01-endnote-13" id="c01-noteref-13">13</a></sup> and Klaus has published his top-fifty unsolved cryptograms on his own blog.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c01-endnote-14" id="c01-noteref-14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Virtually every popular unsolved ciphertext has received numerous dubious solutions. The more famous a cryptogram is, the more people claim to have solved it. At least sixty “solutions” to the Voynich manuscript have been published. Other favorites include the two remaining Zodiac Killer cryptograms, the Dorabella cryptogram, and the fourth <em>Kryptos</em> message. (We will come back to these mysteries later.) The internet is littered with doubtful solutions to famous cryptograms.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_13" title="13"/>If you are a serious codebreaker and believe you have found the solution to an unsolved cryptogram, the first thing to do is challenge your own solution. Could you describe the method simply enough that a third party could use it and generate the same result? Ask yourself if the decryption process you have discovered is straightforward and does not involve too many tweaks and exceptions. Check if the resulting plaintext is meaningful without requiring dozens of alterations and interpretations. Finally, read Ryan Garlick’s 2014 essay “How to Know That You Haven’t Solved the Zodiac-340 Cipher.”<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c01-endnote-15" id="c01-noteref-15">15</a></sup> (It’s about alleged solutions to the second Zodiac cryptogram, but most of the content can be generalized to other cipher mysteries.)</p>
<p>If your solution does make sense, we are, of course, extremely interested in learning about it. If you have solved a cryptogram that is mentioned on Elonka’s list, you can even expect to become a famous codebreaker.</p>
<p>Before you tackle one of the “Mount Everests” of codebreaking, we recommend, dear reader, that you start with cryptograms that have already been solved, of which you will find many in this book. Then, perhaps, proceed to the lesser-known unsolved ones. Some of these have not yet received much attention in the research community, so your chances of success are improved. The codebreaking methods you will learn about in this book might help you succeed. And who knows? One day, you might even master one of the world’s most famous unsolved cipher challenges!</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">This book focuses on breaking pencil-and-paper ciphers, not on modern computer-based encryption. However, this doesn’t mean that we don’t use computers for our codebreaking work. Here are the three most important computer utilities we use in this book (all of which are available for free):</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>CrypTool 2 (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://cryptool.org">https://cryptool.org</a>) is a crypto learning program developed by an international team headed by Bernhard Esslinger. Among other things, it supports many helpful codebreaking tools. The CrypTool project also offers e-learning programs for cryptography and cryptanalysis, such as CrypTool 1, JCrypTool, and CrypTool-Online.</li>
<li>The website dCode (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://dcode.fr/en">https://dcode.fr/en</a>), operated by an anonymous group of crypto-enthusiasts, provides numerous helpful codebreaking and statistics tools.</li>
<li>Cipher Tools (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/">https://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/</a>) is a large collection of classical cryptanalysis tools maintained by Tyler Akins.</li>
</ul>

<p class="BodyFirst">Please note that the encryption techniques covered in this book should not be used to encrypt valuable secrets. This book deals with pencil-and-paper (i.e., manual) encryption. While studying manual encryption is interesting and important for several reasons, using this kind of encryption for sensitive data is completely outdated. If you need a tool to encrypt your computer files, look for a good encryption program such as the open source VeraCrypt or Philip Zimmermann’s well-known PGP. Programs of this kind use modern encryption algorithms, including AES, Diffie-Hellman, and RSA, which can’t be broken with today’s technology.</p>

<p class="ChapterIntro"><em>Social engineering</em> is any attack that leverages human psychology to influence a target, making them either perform an action or provide some information. These attacks play a major role in the information security industry and hacker community, but you’ve probably seen examples of similar behavior in your life as well. </p>
<p>For example, sales and marketing teams often use social engineering tactics. A salesperson who cold-calls potential customers might try to influence the people on the other end of the line by pitching solutions to their problems. Children often mention what the “cool kids” are doing as a means to gain authority with their parents, while parents may give exaggerated warnings about consequences of whatever the child is seeking permission to do (remember how many times the adults tell Ralphie that he’ll shoot his eye out in <em>A Christmas Story</em>)<em>.</em> </p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_4" title="4"/>Many of the people reading this book have likely answered a call from “The Microsofts” or received an email from a “Nigerian prince.” Many people, myself included, have received either the “sextortion” or “bomb threat” bitcoin phish.</p>
<p>This book will teach you the basics of social engineering from a penetration tester’s perspective. The concepts provided here will help you better understand how to conduct social engineering from an ethical standpoint by copying the tactics of a malicious adversary in order to discover security weaknesses that you can later fix. Unlike true criminals, you’ll have permission to perform social engineering attacks, and you won’t intentionally cause harm to your targets. </p>
<h2 id="h1-500983c01-0001">Important Concepts in Social Engineering</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The following sections describe components of social engineering, including the most common kinds of social engineering attacks. As a penetration tester, you can use any of these attacks, but I typically draw an ethical boundary at targeting employees’ personal resources, including their mobile devices, social media accounts, and home computers. The bad guys may not be as nice, but you still shouldn’t always emulate them in your testing, as we’ll discuss in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 2">Chapter 2</span>. </p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c01-0001">Pretexting</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">According to the Social Engineering Framework, <em>pretexting</em> is the act of impersonating someone. You could pretext with a uniform, an invented backstory, or the <em>context for the contact</em>, a term I use to refer to your excuse for talking to your victim. If you claimed to work with the dumpster management company while holding a clipboard and wearing the company’s uniform, for example, you’d be pretexting.</p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c01-0002">Open Source Intelligence </h3>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)</em> is information about your target gathered from a publicly available resource. Sources of OSINT include newspapers, search engines, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or other regulatory body filings, social media, job boards, and review sites, just to name a few. OSINT helps you invent your context for the contact. </p>
<p>OSINT can make or break your social engineering efforts, because in order to be successful, you will often need to know important details about the target company and its employees. What kind of virtual private network (VPN) are they using? What other technologies do they employ? What is the physical layout of the organization’s building? Knowing this information can help the engagement run significantly more smoothly. Several leading penetration testers have told me that the appropriate ratio of time spent collecting OSINT to actually performing the penetration testing ranges from 30/70 to 70/30. </p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c01-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_5" title="5"/>Phishing</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Likely the most common form of social engineering, <em>phishing</em> is the act of sending fraudulent emails to influence or coerce a target into providing information, opening files, or clicking links. I cover the variety of techniques you might use to do this later in this book.</p>
<p>Conventional phishing emails likely aren’t addressed to any specific recipient. Instead, they’re typically sent to lists of email addresses purchased by scammers and criminals. This means you’d probably send the email to a massive swath of people without collecting OSINT about them. For example, with little to no context about the target, you might put a generic email together that tries to get the user to either log in to a fraudulent website or download a file. When targets open the file, a remote shell might open on their computer, or the target might install malware. Once the attackers have the shell or malware installed, they can interactively communicate with the system and perform post-exploitation attacks and privilege escalation to continue compromising the system and network. </p>
<p>Sometimes, <em>exploit kits</em> (software used to perpetrate other attacks and drop malware) use phishing to spread their malicious wares. According to the 2018 Symantec Internet Security Threat Report (ISTR), 0.5 percent of all URL traffic is phishing, and 5.8 percent of that traffic is malicious. That is 1 in 224 of all URLs! </p>
<p>That said, simple phishing attacks like the one described here aren’t common in ethical hacking and penetration testing. If clients hire you to do a penetration test, a safe assumption may be that the client likely has enough security maturity to avoid falling for a simple phishing attack.</p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c01-0004">Spear Phishing</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Spear phishing</em> is a variation of conventional phishing in which the social engineer focuses on a specific target. If you were a fisherman using a spear rather than a net, you’d probably need to know how each species of fish behaved and how to approach them. Similarly, as a social engineer, you’ll need to collect, synthesize, and weaponize OSINT about your target company or person to properly snare them.</p>
<p>The ISTR states that spear phishing is the number one vector in targeted attacks. The report estimated in 2018 that 71 percent of organized groups, including nation-states, cybercriminals, and hacktivists, leverage spear phishing to help carry out their objectives. This number fell to 65 percent in 2019.</p>
<p>If you worked as a social engineering penetration tester (or as a consultant for a firm, a role in which other companies pay you to act in an advisory role or simulate adversaries), you’d probably spend most of your time simulating spear-phishing attacks. These are the most common attacks that companies face, and they require the least amount of direct interaction, making them more affordable for potential clients. </p>
<p>You’d start with an OSINT investigation on the target company or person. This could include learning about the service providers they use, for example. Then you could craft a phishing email claiming, say, to be their <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_6" title="6"/>human resources provider and pretending to offer relevant information about their W-2 or insurance open enrollment. You’d insert the logo of the human resources company in the email, along with company-specific verbiage, and then send the target to a clone of the actual company’s website to attempt to capture their credentials or influence them into downloading a file.</p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c01-0005">Whaling</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Whaling</em> is phishing for the “big phish”—generally, a company’s senior executives. During my time conducting social engineering penetration tests, I found these targets to be more trusting than many others. They also tend to have more access than the average user. For instance, they’re more likely to be a local administrator on the company system. You’ll need to approach these attacks differently than you do phishing or spear phishing, because these people have different motivations than, say, the help desk or sales teams.</p>
<p>Imagine that your target is the CFO of a company. You might try to make some modifications to the fake human resources spear-phishing email you sent earlier to build additional rapport with the target. You could personalize the name on the email, add their position, or mention other key features about the target company’s implementation of the platform that only they should know. Or you may have to use a different scenario altogether, one involving a trade organization or professional group to which your target belongs. OSINT might help you understand the group’s internal lingo. </p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c01-0006">Vishing</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">In a <em>vishing</em> attack, an attacker calls a target and speaks to them over the phone. Vishing is often harder than phishing, because it requires improvisation skills. While phishing affords you the time to think about what you’d like to say before you send your email, vishing entails having your story put together from the beginning and rapidly recalling abstract details of it. You might also have trouble getting people to answer the phone; misunderstand the layout of the workspace; or make huge mistakes, like impersonating the people in the cubicle beside your victim, or using the wrong gender or accent.</p>
<p>The benefit to vishing is that you see the outcome of your attack immediately. When you send an email, you have to wait for your message to be opened, links to be clicked, and data to be input. While vishing is more time-consuming than phishing (especially on a per user basis), you can inflict a lot more damage in a shorter period with a successful vishing campaign. </p>
<p>During these engagements, you’ll likely <em>spoof</em>, or forge, a phone number by using a mobile application or other software and call someone with a pretext. During the call, you’ll build rapport with your target and then attempt to get them to perform an action or provide you with information. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_7" title="7"/>You might say that you’re contracted to do a survey, or claim to be a client, vendor, or customer. You’ll ask them for information relevant to your pretext and then document it in your report.</p>
<p>Be cautious about recording these calls. Some states are single-party states, and others are two-party states. <em>Single-party states</em> require that only one person on the phone consent to recording the call. <em>Two-party states</em> require both parties to consent to the recording. If you’re targeting client-owned resources, the client can provide authorization to record the call as the second party. If you’re interacting with a target’s personal devices, the target themselves must consent, which defeats the purpose of your penetration test. Before doing any testing in this manner, the prudent tester or firm would consult legal counsel to ensure that all activities are legal<em>.</em></p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c01-0007">Baiting</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Baiting</em> is using some sort of bait to get the target to perform an action. This typically involves using USB devices or innovative alternatives like QR codes to get targets to run malicious computer code. To understand the efficiency of QR codes, consider their prevalence in 2020 as restaurants began using them to allow “touch-free” menus.</p>
<p>You might load fake documents onto a USB thumb drive or Hak5 Rubber Ducky and then label those documents as layoffs, raises, bonuses, or the property of the CEO. (A <em>Rubber Ducky</em> is a device with an onboard computer, enclosed in a casing identical to many USB drives, that acts as a keyboard and can input data to a system as though the user were typing it themselves.) You’d then scatter the drives or duckies around the target campus for people to find. </p>
<p>Using a Rubber Ducky has advantages. If you’re using a Rubber Ducky, you could load malicious scripts to the device alongside actual, legitimate files. When someone plugs it into a computer, it will bypass any <em>data loss prevention tools</em> (software or hardware solutions that prevent files from being moved off the computer via USB storage device, email, or a protocol like FTP or SCP), since it poses as a USB keyboard. If you use a regular USB device, you may be stopped by data loss prevention software. If not, the target will open the file and deploy the <em>payload</em> (the script or tool that helps produce the desired outcome).</p>
<p>You could use baiting to get access to a remote shell on a system, which allows you to start interacting with the host computer directly. But baiting is tricky because it’s hard to ensure that the bait makes it to the target’s location and that any shells, connections, or other information gained from the work computer are within the scope of the engagement. People may take the drive home and plug it into a home computer, which you wouldn’t have permission to attack. </p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c01-0008">Dumpster Diving</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Probably the least sexy type of social engineering is <em>dumpster diving</em>, or collecting bags of trash from the target office, and then taking them offsite to dissect for information. You may learn more about the organization and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_8" title="8"/>find exactly what you were looking for. Think of the things you throw away. Some are incredibly personal. Others, though, will be completely irrelevant to your engagement (for instance, the trash bags you collect could come from the company restrooms).</p>
<p>For this type of engagement, you’ll often pretext as an employee of the target’s trash company and come up with a story to get you to the dumpster. When you get there, collect a few bags of trash, take them offsite, and go through them.</p>
<p>When dumpster diving, you’ll probably want to use gloves and maybe even a respirator. You could even stimulate your local economy and hire high school or college students to do the dirty work. Make a note of what you see, read any written materials, and tape any shredded documents back together. This may be the endgame or a stepping stone to something bigger.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500983c01-0002">Psychological Concepts in Social Engineering</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Unlike the rest of the information security field—which borrows concepts from computer science, system administration, programming, and database administration—social engineering borrows most of its concepts from psychology. For this reason, social engineers must stay up to date on developments in psychology and human behavior. </p>
<p>When I was researching for a doctoral dissertation (which I never finished), I spent more time reading psychological and sociological journals than technology journals. I still review a three-inch binder full of peer-reviewed articles from time to time, and I use my alumni access to academic journals to check for new information. In this section, I review some basic psychological concepts that are useful to social engineers. </p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c01-0009">Influence</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Influence</em> is a neutral term for driving a person’s behavior to cause a particular outcome. Influence can be positive or negative. A doctor talking to a patient about their medical conditions, the corrective actions they might take, and the risks they face in order to inspire them to live a healthier lifestyle is an example of influence. </p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c01-0010">Manipulation</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Outside the psychology world, people typically define <em>manipulation</em> in the same way as they define influence. But within the field, the terms have distinctively different meanings. Manipulation is a detrimental implementation of influence, typically meant to cause harm. In social engineering, both bad actors and well-meaning people often use manipulation instead of influence, whether because of a lack of training or short-sightedness. </p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c01-0011">Rapport</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Rapport</em>, in short, is mutual trust. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines rapport as “a friendly, harmonious relationship,” and adds that such a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_9" title="9"/>relationship is usually “characterized by agreement, mutual understanding, or empathy that makes communication possible or easy.” The American Psychological Association (APA) builds on this by saying that “the establishment of rapport with a client in psychotherapy is frequently a significant mediate goal for the therapist to facilitate and deepen the therapeutic experience and promote optimal progress and improvement.”</p>
<p>Like therapists, social engineers try to build rapport with their targets to gain their trust. To build rapport, they often rely on shared experiences (whether real or bluffed), play to the target’s interests, and emphasize their own personality traits. You can use OSINT to learn about the target’s likes and dislikes.</p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c01-0012">Dr. Cialdini’s Six Principles of Persuasion</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">In his book <em>Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</em> (Harper, 1983),<em> </em>psychologist Robert Cialdini<em> </em>details the relationship between influence and manipulation. In this text, Dr. Cialdini outlines six core principles of persuasion: authority, likability, urgency and scarcity, commitment and consistency, social proof, and reciprocity.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at these principles and their applicability.</p>
<h4 id="h3-500983c01-0001">Authority</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">People tend to perform a certain action when someone in a position of authority tells them to do so, or when they are led to believe (truthfully or with false pretense) that an authority figure is also doing that action. I like to use appeals to authority in vishing. For example, I might call and say that I am operating under the authority of the CEO, CISO, or a specific law.</p>
<p>This technique can be very effective. Keep in mind, though, that you should never claim to be an agent of a government. This includes any member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), state police, local police, or sheriff’s department; the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or another tax collection entity; the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), among other agencies. Doing so is a crime!</p>
<h4 id="h3-500983c01-0002">Likability</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">People tend to want to help likable people. Have you ever met a salesperson who hasn’t at least attempted to be likable? Often they’ll give you compliments on your attire, looks, and intelligence to win your favor. </p>
<h4 id="h3-500983c01-0003">Urgency and Scarcity</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">Humans naturally want things of which there are few. I recently took advantage of an offer at a local gym. During the sign-up process, a timer popped up alerting me that I had one minute to complete the transaction, or I would be removed from the pool of eligibility. I went through the process <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_10" title="10"/>three times. The first two times, I finished from the same IP address within the minute. The third time, I wasted about five minutes, and the timer just reset each time the minute ran out.</p>
<p>The moral of the story: the gym tried to use urgency to get me to sign up for something that may or may not have benefited me. The timer gives potential clients an artificial time constraint and a sense that they’ll miss out if they do not act quickly.</p>
<p>When phishing, many scammers claim to be selling or giving away something of which there is only a small, finite quantity. To allure victims into acting, whether it be clicking or inputting information, they’ll offer something expensive in a deal that is too good to be true, with the caveat that victims must act in a short time. </p>
<p>In other cases, a criminal might try to manipulate a victim into paying ransom on their ransomware by threatening to give the victim only a few hours to act before permanently deleting, stealing, or releasing the data—whether they plan on following through or not. The criminals hope to scare victims into acting before they’ve had time to think things through.</p>
<h4 id="h3-500983c01-0004">Commitment and Consistency</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">People value consistency. We don’t like change (most of the time). Sometimes, social engineers either remain consistent or break consistency to influence targets. A salesperson may claim to be more committed to their client’s success than to their commission, saying things like “I have always looked out for my customers. I understand you and your organization. I am a ‘what you see is what you get’ kind of guy.” This is common among salespeople who depend on lasting relationships for their work.</p>
<h4 id="h3-500983c01-0005">Social Proof</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">We are commonly pressed to “keep up with the Joneses.” In other words, we often do things solely because other people deem them normal, appropriate, or of status. Social engineers might convince their targets that something has a high status, or they might say that all the other high-performing employees are doing whatever they are trying to get a target to do. Providing evidence of something’s desirability is called <em>social proof</em>. A car salesperson may try to talk you into a luxury car by telling you that successful people of your age are driving it, for example.</p>
<p>In a social engineering campaign, the attacker could rely on social proof by taking time to collect some OSINT. They might identify who in the company is influential. Then they’d send you an email, claiming that they spoke to the influential person, who sung your praises and provided your contact information to help them solve the “problem.” I’ve had several “recruiters” email me, claiming that a friend gave them my contact information but did not want to be identified. The positions were for Java development, of which I have no mention in my resume or on LinkedIn. This behavior earns them a block.</p>
<h4 id="h3-500983c01-0006"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_11" title="11"/>Reciprocity</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">We all try to help people who help us. Often, social engineers will help someone with a task and then ask them to do something in return that probably isn’t in their best interest. An example of this occurred when I visited the Layer 8 Conference, a social engineering conference in Newport, RI. Next to a pier, I saw a couple trying to take a picture with a sailboat in the background. I offered to take their picture. </p>
<p>“Oh, would you?” they asked.</p>
<p>“Absolutely. You know what? Here is my phone. You can hang on to it so you know I won’t run away with yours,” I replied, to build rapport with them.</p>
<p>I took the picture. Just then, another other majestic boat passed directly behind them. I told them to hold on. “Let me get your picture with this boat in the background,” I said. </p>
<p>They agreed. “That would be awesome.” </p>
<p>I took a few more pictures. Once I was done, I handed them the phone so that they could review them, and they thanked me.</p>
<p>“Hey, you’re welcome. Just out of curiosity, do you have a moment to help me out with the anthropology survey that I am doing as part of my summer classes?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Sure, what is it?” they responded.</p>
<p>Because I took pictures for them, they felt obligated to reciprocate by doing me a favor, even though answering the questions I asked wasn’t in their best interest.</p>
<p>“I’m doing a survey about people’s migration patterns and how different ethnic groups intermingle with other ethnic groups. I’m getting information about names and where they travel and models and such. I’ve got a ridiculous amount of information about the paternal sides of families. What was your mom’s name before she was married?” Notice that I did not say, “What is your mother’s maiden name?” because that question sets off alarms. This is a common password reset question, and people have been conditioned to safeguard this information.</p>
<p>They both told me, and then they told me where they were from. I told them that I had some friends there. This was a lie; really, I just happened to be vaguely familiar with the area. I said that my friends went to a certain high school in their city. They replied that it was a rival high school. I encouraged them. </p>
<p>“What was the mascot?” I asked.</p>
<p>They told me the mascot. I could have kept on going. . . . </p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c01-0013">Sympathy vs. Empathy</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">An excellent way to build rapport, <em>sympathy</em> is caring that a person feels bad or is under some form of duress, like after losing a loved one or pet. Sometimes confused with sympathy, <em>empathy</em> is understanding how people feel as if you were in their situation. Empathy uses shared emotions or shared perspectives, whereas sympathy expresses only how <em>you</em> feel. </p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_12" title="12"/>Both of these are important to building rapport under certain circumstances. You need to be able to express how you feel, and how the victim feels, to be able to exert influence and to know when you’re going too far. When interacting with a victim, you may share a story (whether it’s real, fake, or some embellished combination of the two) of a similar situation you were in and how it made you feel. This allows them to show empathy for your situation and will enhance your rapport. Alternatively, if someone tells you something you cannot relate to, asking them questions about the situation or telling them that you’re sorry something happened is an example of expressing sympathy. Be careful, though: if you have an answer or anecdote for everything a person tells you, they may grow suspicious, so use this approach sparingly.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500983c01-0003">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Social engineering can be an incredibly high-powered tool for gaining access. This chapter introduced you to a range of techniques, many of which we’ll explore in more depth throughout the book.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that rapport is the name of the game. Once you’ve built rapport, the rest of your engagement is easier. Understanding the psychological concepts and underlying human behavior is one helpful way to make a connection with someone. Also, the more OSINT you collect, the more intelligently you can speak about an organization. You can find tidbits for building rapport with employees while also learning about culture, operations, and technologies, which can make later activities in a pentesting or red team engagement easier. The information will help you whether you’re phishing, spear phishing, whaling, vishing, baiting, or dumpster diving.</p>

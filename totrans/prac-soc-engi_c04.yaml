- en: In 2017, I won DerbyCon’s Social Engineering Capture the Flag (SECTF). This
    exercise pit me and five other competitors against an unknowing Fortune 500 business
    in the Louisville, KY area. We spent three weeks collecting OSINT, followed by
    20 minutes in a (mostly) soundproof booth to vish the target company’s employees.
    While researching my target company, I checked an executive’s social media accounts
    and learned that he’d been late to a business meeting in Amsterdam because an
    airline had delayed his flight in Newark. This seemingly harmless piece of information
    gave me the perfect excuse for contacting him.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this knowledge, I added that airline’s phone number to my list of numbers
    to vish. I then acquired the executive’s name, email address, and phone number,
    and added those to my list of targets. Had this been an engagement allowing phishing,
    I would have sent an apology email that mimicked the airline’s template, and then
    followed up with a phone call, pretending to be the airline. Then I could have
    confirmed the information I already knew and asked “security questions” to convince
    the target that I was a trusted source. I might have even incorporated a few Windows
    operating system sounds to amplify my credibility. Finally, I would have asked
    him potentially lethal questions about the company’s operating environment, such
    as the status of equipment upgrades, operating schedules, or other company-specific
    confidential data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    post about his delayed flight. Rarely will an effective social engineering attack
    happen without an informed understanding of the target. Better OSINT makes better

    an excellent tool to help enumerate these. Without logging in, you can get the
    basic email address syntax used at the company. Once you create an account and
    log in, you can get the most common email address syntaxes, full company email
    addresses, and occasionally, a person’s title.

    addresses. You can then pivot to LinkedIn and the corporate website to get more
    names, and then put more email addresses together yourself should you want to
    phish those people.

    range from free (100 requests per month and no CSV export) all the way to $399
    per month, which includes 50,000 requests and allows CSV exports.

    Google Maps to determine the shipping vendors for my target company by checking
    whose trucks were within the confines of the gates. I could have used this information
    to gain physical access, maybe by finding a uniform at a thrift shop, or as a
    vishing pretext to call about a shipment.

- en: Using both Google Maps and Bing Maps can give you better information, as the
    source of the apps’ data is different. Furthermore, the images are collected on
    different days, so you might, for example, find a delivery truck in one app but
    not in another, a new dumpster in a more recent photo, or poorly censored vendor
    names.

    the surface of these tools’ capabilities, and it’s meant as a starting point that
    will help you apply OSINT techniques to social engineering, penetration testing,
    or any other ethical application. Through the exercises in this chapter, you’ve
    collected domains, IP addresses, email addresses, names, and technologies associated
    with businesses using open source tools.

- en: Open Garages is a collaboration of like-minded individuals interested in hacking
    automotive systems, whether through performance tuning, artistic modding, or security
    research. There are Open Garages groups across the United States and United Kingdom,
    and anyone can start or join one. You can, of course, hack cars in your own garage,
    but it’s way more fun and productive to hack multiple projects with friends. To
    learn more, visit *[http://www.opengarages.org/](http://www.opengarages.org/)*
    for details on groups in your area, join the mailing list to receive the latest
    announcements, and follow Open Garages on Twitter [@OpenGarages](mailto:@OpenGarages).

    you through how to build your own group, and then you can submit the Open Garages
    Character Sheet on the following page to *[og@openGarages.org](mailto:og@openGarages.org)*.

    is where you should sketch out your idea for a garage. You can sketch anything
    you want: a layout for a garage, notes, a logo, and so on. You can either come
    up with a name for your space now or wait until you have a few more members to
    decide. If you’re planning to host your meetings out of an existing hackerspace,
    you may want to just use that space’s name or some variation of it.'

    your meetings as frequent as you like. The timing of your meetings may depend
    on the type of space you have available and whether you’re sharing it with anyone
    else.

    the public. Under the checkboxes, enter your Open and Close times. If you want
    your event to meet less often than weekly, pick which week of the month you’ll
    meet. For instance, if you want to meet on the first Saturday of every month from
    6 to 9 PM, your sheet would look like [Figure C-1](app03.html#app03fig1).

    Affiliation line. Then decide whether you want to offer private membership. Your
    Open Garages group must be open to the public at least one day of the month, but
    you can offer private memberships with additional perks, like access to the space
    for extended hours or access to special equipment. Private membership fees can
    help pay for space rental, tools, insurance, and various other costs as they come
    up.

    their membership cost information. Sometimes it’s easier to find a local hackerspace
    and host Open Garages meetings from their location. If you choose to go that route,
    be sure to support whatever rules and requirements that hackerspace has, and try
    to promote their space with your announcements. Be sure to list the cost of membership
    and how often payment is due, which is typically monthly or yearly.

- en: Under the garage illustration in the upper-left corner of the sheet are some
    basic questions about your space. You don’t need to have immediate access to a
    vehicle workshop to start an Open Garages group, but you should have a place to
    meet to discuss projects and collaborate, whether that’s your home garage, a hackerspace,
    a mechanics shop, or even a coffee shop.

- en: '**Bays** The number of vehicle spaces available, if any. If you’re holding
    your meeting in a two-car home garage, you’d enter *2* here. If you’re meeting
    in a coffee shop or a similar space, put a *0*.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Meeting Space Holds** Try to determine how many people can fit in your space.
    If you’re meeting in a coffee shop, note how many people you think can feasibly
    meet at one time. If your space has an office area, figure out how many it seats.
    If your space is a garage or a parking lot, you can put *N/A*. You can also note
    disability accessibility here.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Restrooms** It’s a good idea to make beverages available during Open Garages
    meetings, so you’ll want access to a restroom. Here, you can enter *Yes* or *No*
    or something like *behind the shed*.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Internet Speed** If your space is a coffee shop with Wi-Fi access you can
    just put *Wi-Fi*, though if you know what your Internet speed is, it’s useful
    to note it here. If you’re in a garage or somewhere without Internet access, you
    can write *tether* or *N/A*.'

    rules for parking in that area. You should also note whether these rules vary
    depending on the time of day or whether someone is a private member.'

- en: The box to the right of the space description is where you should note all of
    your contact information for people who want to collaborate and organize with
    you. Most of this should be self-explanatory. The Signup Site section is required
    only if you take private membership or if people need to RSVP; otherwise, leave
    this blank or put *N/A*. The Website section is where you should list the main
    website for your group. If you don’t have a site, just use *[http://www.opengarages.org/](http://www.opengarages.org/)*.
    You can list your IRC room or Twitter account if you have one. List anything else
    under Other.
  prefs: []

- en: The black box marked Vehicle Specialty is where you can add information about
    a particular vehicle focus of your group, like *BMW* or *motorcycles*. You could
    also use this space to limit the type of research to be performed in the space
    if, for example, you’re interested in researching only performance tuning.

- en: To kick off an Open Garages group, you need some people to take leadership responsibility
    to ensure it begins as smoothly as possible. The first person on this list should
    be you, of course! If you can get a few other friends to pitch in right off the
    bat, that’s great. If not, you can run your group by yourself until more members
    join.
  prefs: []

    is opened on time and securely closed at the end. If you plan to launch a full-blown
    nonprofit organization, this list would probably consist of your board members.

    the information won’t be published or show up on any website. The contact information

    on hardware and software that will be a help in your Open Garages group. Some
    tools to list are 3D printers, MIG welders, lifts, rollers, scan tools, and so
    on. There’s no need to list small things, like screwdrivers and butt connectors.

    you might use the Membership Level space to denote that the user must be a paid
    member to access these tools. You can also use the Skill Ranking space to state
    the level of skill or training needed in order to operate a particular tool.

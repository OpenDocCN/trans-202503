<p class="ch-sub"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_25"/>In this chapter, you’ll create four simple LED projects.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0025-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_26"/>There’s a reason LED projects are among the earliest projects aspiring electronics hobbyists encounter: they offer simplicity as well as a glowing payoff. The following projects were featured on the Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories blog (<em><a href="https://www.evilmadscientist.com/">https://www.evilmadscientist.com/</a></em>). These simple projects will prepare you to tackle the more advanced projects found later in the book. First we’ll show you how to make an LED-Lit Sea Urchin, and then you’ll create an Edge-Lit Holiday Card, a Dark-Detecting LED, and Electric Origami.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev26"><strong>#1: LED-LIT SEA URCHINS</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">At a beach shop during one vacation, we came across some tiny sea urchin shells, thin and light as eggshells. What to do with them? Light them up with LEDs, of course!</p>
<p class="indent">Seashell lamps aren’t necessarily new, but they’re usually made with large, heavy, and colorful shells. In contrast, these sea urchins are smaller and lighter, and illumination shows off their natural beauty.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev27"><strong>Get the Parts</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">For this project, you’ll need to find some small sea urchin shells, or some other similar container with walls thin enough to be translucent. The ideal size is about 4 inches across.</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent">LEDs (for example, Evil Mad Scientist <em><a href="https://emsl.us/743">https://emsl.us/743</a></em> or SparkFun P/N 12062)</li>
<li class="noindent">Coin cell CR2032 batteries (SparkFun P/N 338)</li>
<li class="noindent">Small, light sea urchin shells</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Each urchin has a hole in the bottom large enough to fit a pretty good size LED, although not necessarily the battery as well. When the shells are lit, they should look something like <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig1">Figure 1-1</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch01fig1"/><img src="../images/f0026-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 1-1:</strong> Different-colored LEDs make for an assortment of urchins.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev28"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_27"/><strong>Build It</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">First we’ll connect our LEDs to watch batteries, a combination known as <em>throwies</em> because they’re small and cheap enough that you could theoretically throw them without worry. We won’t ask you to throw anything in this project, but you’ll use the throwies to illuminate the urchin shell.</p>
<ol>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Make the throwies.</strong> Select an LED of any color. The longer leg is positive and the shorter leg is negative. Simply connect the leads to the battery terminals, taping the positive leg to the positive battery side and the negative leg to the negative side, and you have a tiny light, as shown in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig2">Figure 1-2</a>. Bend the leads so that the LED points up, away from the battery.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch01fig2"/><img src="../images/f0027-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 1-2:</strong> Combining a battery and an LED makes for quick and easy illumination.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Assemble the urchins.</strong> Insert the throwie in the hole at the bottom of the shell. If your battery doesn’t fit, just poke the head of the LED through and rest the shell on the battery. Repeat this process for as many shells and colors as you like.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Voilà! The urchins are complete and glowing dramatically, showing off their elaborate shell structures. Your lamps should last about one to two weeks depending on the color of the LED.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev29"><strong>#2: EDGE-LIT HOLIDAY CARDS</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In this project, you’ll make your own LED-lit holiday cards using clear plastic and a simple LED assembly. <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig3">Figure 1-3</a> shows a few cards we created. The technique we employ, commonly called <em>edge-lit</em>, involves placing a lit LED on the edge of an etched piece of acrylic. This gives the etched area a nice glow without visible wires or other hardware.</p>
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_28"/><a id="ch01fig3"/><img src="../images/f0028-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 1-3:</strong> Create LED cards for your loved ones.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev30"><strong>Get the Parts</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll need just a few supplies to make your LED holiday card.</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent">LEDs with clear lenses, preferably 3 mm or rectangular (for example, <em><a href="https://emsl.us/533">https://emsl.us/533</a></em> or SparkFun P/N 08285)</li>
<li class="noindent">Clear plastic (approximately 2.5 × 3 inches, 1/16 inch thick)</li>
<li class="noindent">Electrical tape</li>
<li class="noindent">Coin cell CR2032 battery (SparkFun P/N 338)</li>
<li class="noindent">Pen</li>
<li class="noindent">Paper and cardstock</li>
<li class="noindent">Scissors</li>
<li class="noindent">Hobby knife</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev31"><strong>Build It</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">To create your own holiday card, first you need a design. You’ll score this design into the plastic and the LED will light it from the bottom edge, reflecting off the score lines to create the glowing effect. You’ll need to keep the design simple (like the Christmas tree and snowflake designs in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig3">Figure 1-3</a>), as scoring into the plastic isn’t the most precise drawing method.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll begin with a piece of clear plastic sized at roughly 2.5 × 3 inches (65 × 75 mm) and 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) thick. We used acrylic, but you can also use polycarbonate, polypropylene, or a number of other clear plastics. You can cut a piece out of a thick-walled clear plastic container or get material like this at the hardware or hobby store. Our clear acrylic came with protective blue film on both sides.</p>
<ol>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_29"/><strong>Cut a piece of plastic.</strong> If your sheet of plastic is bigger than 2.5 × 3 inches, you’ll need to cut it down. This particular material cannot be cut with scissors—it cracks and shatters—so you’ll need to score it with a sharp hobby knife or box cutter and a metal straightedge, and then snap it quickly along the scored line. Using that method, it’s pretty quick to cut an appropriately sized piece of plastic from a larger sheet. <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig4">Figure 1-4</a> shows the plastic in its protective film.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch01fig4"/><img src="../images/f0029-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 1-4:</strong> Cut a piece of plastic to match your card design.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Create the paper template.</strong> Trace the size of your plastic piece onto a sheet of paper. Then, draw a second rectangle inside the first (<a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig5">Figure 1-5</a>), leaving a gap of about 0.5 inch (13 mm). Your drawing needs to fit well within this inner rectangle, to ensure that the final design is nicely centered on the plastic.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch01fig5"/><img src="../images/f0029-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 1-5:</strong> Trace the piece of plastic, then draw a rectangle inside it.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_30"/><strong>Draw the design and trace it.</strong> When your paper drawing is finalized, place it on top of the plastic and trace it with the hobby knife.</p>
<p class="indent">Obviously, how cool your shape looks will influence how cool the final product looks. <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig6">Figure 1-6</a> is just a simple tree pattern—not too tricky. For the snowflake, you can print out and trace some real snowflake patterns.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch01fig6"/><img src="../images/f0030-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 1-6:</strong> Draw your design inside the inner rectangle.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Attach an LED and battery.</strong> This project uses the same classic LED throwie arrangement shown in the LED-Lit Sea Urchins project. Attach an LED directly to the leads of a CR2032 lithium coin cell as described in “<a href="ch01.xhtml#lev28">Build It</a>” on <a href="ch01.xhtml#page_27">page 27</a>, but this time don’t bend the leads at a right angle. Now, when you position the bright LED at the edge of the plastic (shown in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig7">Figure 1-7</a>), it lights up the areas that you’ve scored.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Tape up the edges.</strong> Keep holding the LED to the bottom edge of the plastic so the light goes into the scored lines. Next, use black electrical tape to restrict light from going in other directions. Put down a piece of tape, sticky side up, and stick the plastic plate to the top half of the tape with the LED below it. Next, place a matching piece of tape on top, forming a tight seal around the LED to keep it pointed into the plastic (<a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig8">Figure 1-8</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Next, seal the other three sides of the plastic plate with black tape the same way, as shown in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig9">Figure 1-9</a>. Note that the tape only needs to cover the very edge of the plastic. After you’ve finished this process, the single LED will light up the design etched into the plastic without leaking much light elsewhere.</p>
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_31"/><a id="ch01fig7"/><img src="../images/f0031-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 1-9:</strong> Tape up the edges of the design</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_32"/><strong>Prepare the paper card.</strong> Next, you need to start the card itself. We used 9 × 12 inch heavy Bristol cardstock, but other heavy opaque papers will work as well, and the size isn’t that critical. Fold the paper in half twice to make a classic greeting card shape with two layers on the front and back fold, each about 4.5 × 6 inches or so.</p>
<p class="indent">Place your completed edge-lit plastic assembly on top of the folded card to make sure it’s going to fit, and determine where you’re going to position it.</p>
<p class="indent">Next you’ll cut a window in the front of the card so that the plastic design can show through. Cut out the inner rectangle from your template from step 2 and trace around it onto the front of your card. Unfold the card before you cut to make sure you cut only the front layer. Score the outline with the hobby knife and then carefully cut it out with either the hobby knife or scissors. You’ll attach the edge-lit plastic assembly behind the window you just cut out.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch01fig10"/><img src="../images/f0032-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 1-10:</strong> Cutting out a rectangle matching the design</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Assemble the card.</strong> Now place the plastic assembly inside the card so that the design is centered in the window, with the side of the plastic that you cut facing outward. Tape it in place, including the battery (<a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig11">Figure 1-11</a>).</p>
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_33"/><a id="ch01fig11"/><img src="../images/f0033-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 1-11:</strong> Taping the battery in place</p>
<p class="indent">With this setup, the card will be lit until the battery goes dead in a week or so, which is fine if you’re giving this as a gift in person, but not so good if you’re mailing it. For that, you can rig it up so that the LED won’t turn on until the recipient opens the card.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Insert a pull tab (optional).</strong> Before taping the battery, insert a paper strip between one of the LED legs and the battery, leaving the end of the strip poking out. This strip will break the circuit and prevent the LED from turning on. Write <em>Pull</em> on the end of the strip and tape the battery in place. When the card recipient pulls the paper tab, the leg will again touch the battery, completing the circuit and turning the LED on.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev32"><strong>Take It Further</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">One final trick for extra coolness: use two layers of color with two independent, stacked edge-lit displays, one with a green LED and one with a red LED. You can see an example in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig12">Figure 1-12</a>, where a plastic layer with red-lit LEDs is on top of a green layer.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s not easy to capture with a photo, but the red dots are crisp and clear and float in front of the green tree because of the second layer. The 3D effect is really quite wonderful. We made the dots on the red layer by pressing a push pin into the plastic, rather than using a knife. Inside the card, it’s just as you would expect: two layers of plastic with their own LED each at the bottom edge, with electrical tape around the edges to prevent light leakage. This is actually a very old display technique. Stack enough layers, and you can even make a side-lit light-guide numeric display clock!</p>
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_34"/><a id="ch01fig12"/><img src="../images/f0034-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 1-12:</strong> Layer two or more sheets of plastic on top of each other to add multiple colors to the design.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev33"><strong>#3: DARK-DETECTING LED</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s a common question: How do you make an LED turn on when it gets dark? You might call this the “night-light problem,” but it comes up in a lot of familiar situations—emergency lights, street lights, computer keyboard backlights, and the list goes on.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many solutions to this problem. The traditional one is to use a circuit with a <em>CdS photoresistor</em>, sometimes called a <em>photocell</em> or <em>light-dependent resistor (LDR)</em>. Photoresistors are reliable and cost only about $1 each, but are being used less and less because they contain cadmium, a toxic heavy metal whose use is increasingly regulated. Luckily, there are many other options.</p>
<p class="indent">This project will show you how to design your own dark-detecting LED using a phototransistor, seen in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig13">Figure 1-13</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch01fig13"/><img src="../images/f0034-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 1-13:</strong> This LED turns on when the lights go out.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_35"/>You can do almost anything with this inexpensive light-controlled LED circuit, but one fun application is to make LED throwies that turn themselves off in the daytime to save power. Throwies normally can last up to two weeks, and adding a light-level switch like this can significantly extend their lifetime.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev34"><strong>Get the Parts</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">To make this project, you’ll need the soldering tools described in the appendix. In addition, you’ll use the following electronic components, seen in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig14">Figure 1-14</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent">Super bright LED (for example, <em><a href="https://emsl.us/620">https://emsl.us/620</a></em> or <em><a href="https://emsl.us/606">https://emsl.us/606</a></em>; or SparkFun P/N 528 or 10632)</li>
<li class="noindent">Coin cell CR2032 battery (SparkFun P/N 338)</li>
<li class="noindent">LTR-4206E phototransistor (<em><a href="https://emsl.us/437">https://emsl.us/437</a></em> or Mouser P/N 859-LTR-4206E)</li>
<li class="noindent">2N3904 transistor (<em><a href="https://emsl.us/98">https://emsl.us/98</a></em> or SparkFun P/N 521)</li>
<li class="noindent">1 kΩ resistor (<em><a href="https://emsl.us/234">https://emsl.us/234</a></em> or an assortment such as SparkFun P/N 10969)</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The last three parts cost about $0.30 all together, and much less in bulk.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch01fig14"/><img src="../images/f0035-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 1-14:</strong> Components needed for your dark-detecting LED</p>
<p class="indent">The LTR-4206E is a phototransistor in a 3 mm black package. The black package blocks visible light, so the phototransistor is sensitive only to infrared light—it sees sunlight and incandescent lights, but not fluorescent light or most discharge lamps, which means it can be programmed to only come on at night.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_36"/>As in the previous projects, you’ll start by making an LED throwie. Then, you’ll add on the phototransistor and use its output to control the transistor, which turns the LED on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev35"><strong>How It Works</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">When light falls on the phototransistor, it begins to conduct up to about 1.5 mA, which pulls down the voltage at the lower side of the resistor by 1.5 V. This turns off the transistor, which turns off the LED. When it’s dark, the phototransistor is able to conduct about 15 mA through the LED, so the circuit uses only about one-tenth as much current while the LED is off.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev36"><strong>Build It</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Now it’s time to start building. You can certainly put this project together on a breadboard, but there’s something more satisfying about the compact and deployable build that we walk through here.</p>
<ol>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Solder the resistor and transistor.</strong> First get the transistor and the resistor. The pins of the 2N3904 transistor are—from left to right when viewed from the front—emitter, base, and collector. You’ll solder the resistor between the leads of the transistor’s base and collector, per the diagram shown in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig15">Figure 1-15</a>. (If you haven’t soldered before or would like some pointers, turn to the appendix.) Hold the resistor with its leads at 90 degrees to those of the transistor and solder, then clip off the excess resistor lead of the transistor base (middle pin) and the collector (right pin).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch01fig15"/><img src="../images/f0036-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 1-15:</strong> Circuit schematic for the dark-detecting LED</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Attach the phototransistor.</strong> Next, add the phototransistor, shown in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig16">Figure 1-16</a>. Note that it has a flattened side, much like an LED does. This pin on the flat side is the collector of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_37"/>phototransistor. Solder the flat-side collector to the base (middle pin) of the transistor, again at 90 degrees. Leave the other pin of the phototransistor, the emitter, unconnected for now.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch01fig16"/><img src="../images/f0037-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 1-16:</strong> The phototransistor is the black bulb in the upper center of the figure</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Test the LED.</strong> For this step you need to know which LED leg is positive and which is negative. Regrettably, markings on LEDs are not consistent, so the best way to check polarity is to test it with the lithium coin cell: place the LED across the terminals of the cell with one leg on either side. If it doesn’t light the first time, swap the side the legs are on. When the LED lights up, note which side is touching the (+) terminal; this is the positive leg (usually it’s the one with the longer lead). Solder the positive lead of the LED to the emitter (left pin) of the transistor, which doesn’t have anything soldered to it. Trim away the excess lead of the LED that goes past the solder joint. Solder the negative lead of the LED to the phototransistor’s emitter—the pin on the non-flattened side, which doesn’t yet have anything connected to it. Do not trim this leg.</p>
<p class="indent">By this point, there are only two pins extending below the components: one that goes to the resistor and collector (rightmost pin) of the transistor, and one that goes to the emitter of the phototransistor and the negative leg of the LED. To test the circuit, squeeze the coin cell between these two terminals, with the positive side touching the resistor. <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig17">Figure 1-17</a> shows the circuit in a darkened room; its LED lit up.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_38"/><a id="ch01fig17"/><img src="../images/f0038-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 1-17:</strong> Darkness triggers the assembled LED circuit.</p>
<p class="indent">Now you have a tiny dark-detecting light! You can make it more stable by taping the legs to the battery. This one makes a pretty good night-light attached to the top of a doorframe—when the room lights are off, it shines a bright spot on the ceiling.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev37"><strong>Take It Further</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">While this little circuit works on its own, it can also be used as part of a larger circuit. Certainly, this is one of the easiest and least expensive ways to control an LED with a photosensor, so you can make several and adapt them to many purposes, such as combining them with the sea urchin shells in the first project for urchin night-lights.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev38"><strong>#4: ELECTRIC ORIGAMI</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The little LED-lit cube seen in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig18">Figure 1-18</a> is much more than just a paper lantern: it’s a translucent thin-film electronic circuit that hooks a battery up to an LED, and is flexible enough to be folded into an origami box. The coolest thing about circuits like these? You can make them at home.</p>
<p class="indent">In this project, you’ll combine a basic LED throwie and papercraft, in the form of a traditional origami balloon, to make what might be called an <em>LED foldie</em>. The circuitry consists of aluminum foil traces, ironed onto adhesive paper (such as freezer paper or photo-mounting paper) or a laser-printed pattern. This construction can then be folded to fit an LED and battery to complete the circuit.</p>
<div class="note">

<h4 class="h4" id="lev39"><strong>Get the Parts</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Gather the following parts and materials:</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent">LED (for example, <em><a href="https://emsl.us/369">https://emsl.us/369</a></em> or SparkFun P/N 12062)</li>
<li class="noindent">Coin cell CR2032 battery (SparkFun P/N 338)</li>
<li class="noindent">Origami paper (we used standard 10 inch squares)</li>
<li class="noindent">Aluminum foil</li>
<li class="noindent">Freezer paper or photo-mounting paper (the same size as the origami paper)</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev40"><strong>Build It</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The first step in designing a three-dimensional circuit like this is to create the enclosure and see where the parts will go. After that you’ll unfold the model, draw circuit paths between the points you want to connect, and go from there.</p>
<ol>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Fold the balloon prototype.</strong> To get started, first fold an origami balloon. (There are a million tutorials on the web if you need guidance.) This balloon won’t be the final one you use, but you’ll draw your circuit out on it. Don’t inflate the balloon—keep it in its final folded shape, because you’ll be transferring the design to a sheet of freezer paper.</p>
<p class="indent">Origami balloons have a couple of features that are useful for this project. They have a convenient pocket on the side, where you’ll put a lithium coin cell. They also have a single hole in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_40"/>bottom; this is where the LED will go, so tuck the leads into the folds on the side opposite the battery. <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig19">Figure 1-19</a> shows the balloon with the components temporarily placed.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch01fig19"/><img src="../images/f0040-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 1-19:</strong> Temporarily place the components on your balloon prototype.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Unfold the balloon.</strong> Mark the locations of the battery and LED terminals on the origami balloon while it’s still folded, and then unfold it. This is your circuit board. At this point, you should have the component locations marked, but no lines drawn between them. You can see the unfolded balloon in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig20">Figure 1-20</a>.</p>

<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_41"/><strong>Draw the circuits.</strong> Next, you’ll add those circuitry lines (circuit board wires, or traces) between the battery and LED, as seen in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig21">Figure 1-21</a>. Draw traces connecting the positive LED leg to the positive battery side, and the negative LED leg to negative on the battery. You’ll cut these traces out of foil and stick them inside. One thing to keep in mind for interfacing papercraft to electronics: it’s helpful if the circuit traces fold over the leads for the LED in order to maintain good contact, so leaving a little extra at the ends of the traces is always a good idea.</p>
<p class="indent">After connecting the dots (so to speak), you have the resulting layout of your circuit. Pretty simple here—only two traces! The two round pads contact the two sides of the battery, and the two angled pads contact the two leads of the LED.</p>

<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Fabricate the circuit board.</strong> The next step is to actually fabricate the circuit board. We call this the <em>freezer paper</em> method of attachment, where you laminate foil traces to plastic-coated paper. Lay your circuit diagram over a piece of aluminum foil (<a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig22">Figure 1-22</a>) and trace over it with a stylus (a wooden skewer or blunt toothpick works well) to make an indented outline on the foil.</p>

<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Cut out and attach the traces.</strong> Next, cut out your traced pattern. Scissors work well, of course. Be careful not to tear the foil! <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig23">Figure 1-23</a> shows the traced pattern, ready to cut.</p>

<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_43"/><strong>Laminate the foil.</strong> Prefold your freezer paper into the origami balloon shape and compare it to your circuit layout to see where to position the aluminum foil pieces on your freezer paper. Place the foil on the shiny side of the freezer paper, as shown in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig24">Figure 1-24</a>. To stop your iron from sticking to the adhesive, place a large sheet of parchment paper over the freezer paper. Once you have your traces positioned, use an iron set to 330 degrees Fahrenheit to laminate the foil to the paper.</p>

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 1-24:</strong> Place the foil on the shiny side of the paper.</p>
<p class="indent">We used a small hobby iron to fuse the foil to our different papers, but a regular iron works just as well. The dry-mount adhesive does not require much heat, but the iron must be on high to melt the plastic of the freezer paper.</p>
<p class="indent">We experimented with waxed paper, which was not sticky enough for the aluminum foil, and even tried applying copper leaf to waxed paper, but it was too fragile and the traces broke upon folding. This combination would probably work reasonably well in an application where folding isn’t required: it was absolutely beautiful but completely unreliable for origami. <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig25">Figure 1-25</a> shows the traces as the balloon is folded.</p>

<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Finish the balloon.</strong> Once the foil is adhered to the paper, refold the balloon with the traces on the outside, inflate it by blowing through the hole at the bottom, and then test the balloon. Insert the components in their correct places, and the balloon should light up. If it doesn’t, try turning your battery around. If it still doesn’t light up, make sure your LED leads are contacting the traces. It’s a friction fit, the strength of which is determined by the tightness of the origami folds.</p></li>

<p class="notet"><strong>HINT</strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>You won’t hurt the LED by plugging it in backward to that little battery, so this is a better method than actually trying to keep track of the polarity. The LED foldie naturally wants to sit on the heaviest part, the battery, with the LED projecting into the side of the balloon. The weight of the battery helps keep the circuit connected.</em></p>

<p class="indent">When you get everything working, it should look like <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig26">Figure 1-26</a>.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="lev41"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_45"/><strong>Take It Further: The Direct Toner Method</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Our last breakthrough came when we created a PDF pattern to print out. We discovered that you could fuse the foil directly to the toner from a laser printer. This works only for laser printers, not inkjet. You can print out the pattern and iron your foil pieces directly to the paper—the heated toner will adhere to the foil.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a caveat with this method. While the foil sticks well to the toner, it isn’t quite strong enough that you can just iron on a giant sheet of foil and peel it off so it sticks only where there’s toner, so you still need to cut out the foil shapes, at least roughly. After printing out the pattern, place it over your aluminum foil, trace the outlines, and cut out the foil pieces.</p>
<p class="indent">Place your foil carefully over the pattern, and iron well at very high heat. Be sure to cover your work with parchment paper, or you’ll get toner on your iron. When your foil is stuck to the toner and it’s cooled down, cut out the square for the balloon and get ready to fold.</p>
<p class="indent">Fold gently so you disturb the traces as little as possible. They may come loose in areas with multiple folds, but should stay on enough for assembly. Inflate the balloon, add the battery and LED, and admire the glow. As before, if you have trouble, try turning your battery around and making sure that the leads of the LED are making contact with the foil.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev42"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned about the simplest LED project imaginable, the throwie, and used it in a number of (nonthrown!) projects. You also learned some more challenging techniques that will serve you well, like making your own circuit traces. Hopefully these easy projects have piqued your curiosity about the projects that lie ahead!</p>

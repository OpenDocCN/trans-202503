    to find out how many times better one hypothesis was than a competing one. But
    these tools of Bayesian reasoning can do even more than just compare ideas. In
    this chapter, we’ll use the Bayes factor and posterior odds to quantify how much
    evidence it should take to convince someone of a hypothesis. We’ll also see how
    to estimate the strength of someone else’s prior belief in a certain hypothesis.
    We’ll do all of this using a famous episode of the classic TV series *The Twilight
    Zone*.

    In this episode, a young, newly married couple, Don and Pat, wait in a small-town
    diner while a mechanic repairs their car. In the diner, they come across a fortune-telling
    machine called the Mystic Seer that accepts yes or no questions and, for a penny,
    spits out cards with answers to each question.
  prefs: []

    When the machine answers correctly, he begins to believe in its supernatural powers.
    However, Pat remains skeptical of the machine’s powers, even as the Seer continues
    to provide correct answers.

    How can we explain why they reason differently when given the same evidence? We

    answer wrong, the probability for this hypothesis will drop to 0, because a psychic
    machine wouldn’t ever guess incorrectly. In that case, we might want to come up
    with a weaker hypothesis—for example, that the Mystic Seer is correct 90 percent

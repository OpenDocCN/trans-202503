    you’re being pursued by a herd of brain-hungry zombies. You finally reach your
    base, and all you have to do to survive another day is get inside to safety. Don’t
    fumble with keys and get eaten before you can unlock the door. Unlock it before
    you get there! To help you out, this chapter includes projects that allow you
    to unlock (or lock) doors without touching them. Just don’t press any door-opening
    buttons with without checking your surveillance system first; no matter how politely
    someone knocks ([Figure 6-1](ch06.html#ch06fig1)), you never know if they’re alive
    or undead.

    electromechanical door latch, you can press a button to open the door and avoid
    making jingling key sounds that would attract nearby zombies. This project uses
    a 12V latch. This door latch will work with the existing door lock, and you can
    fit one to an existing door by replacing the socket that the lock normally engages
    with, as shown in [Figure 6-2](ch06.html#ch06fig2). Note the latch part in the
    middle that is released by the electromagnet.

    Press a button to unlock the door ([Figure 6-3](ch06.html#ch06fig3)), and the
    door will stay unlocked as long as you hold down the button. If you have fellow
    survivors living with you, this would probably be inside your base, ready for
    you to let others in. However, if you are on your own, you may want to position
    it on the outside of your base, right by the door, but high up where it can’t
    be accidentally activated by zombies.

    it just before you get to it, and slam it in the face of that pursuing horde of
    zombies.

    each other but not touching. It is best to have the magnet on the door rather
    than the frame, because the frame doesn’t move and will not flex the wires, which
    would shorten their life. [Figure 6-15](ch06.html#ch06fig15) shows the reed switch

    on the back to stick them to the door as well as mounting holes, so you can attach
    them to the wall nonpermanently, as I’ve done. However, if you are still worried
    about home decor after the zombie apocalypse, be warned that the adhesive may
    damage the paint when you remove the reed switch and magnet.

    your base secure. In [Chapter 7](ch07.html#ch07), you’ll connect smoke and temperature
    alarms to your hard-working Arduino to protect yourself from more natural disasters
    that might occur—as if zombies aren’t enough!

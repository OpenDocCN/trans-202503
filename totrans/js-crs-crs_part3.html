<p class="PartIntro">You’ve learned the basics of JavaScript and some powerful techniques for using JavaScript within web pages to create interactive applications. Now it’s time to put these techniques to use by building some real projects!</p>
<p class="TX">This part of the book features three substantial projects that will help you practice what you’ve learned, show you how to develop and organize more sophisticated programs, and give you a taste of some of the many exciting things JavaScript can do. There are no dependencies between the projects, so you can work on them in any order you wish. Here’s a little preview of each:</p>
<p class="ListHead"><b><a href="part4.xhtml">Project 1</a>: Creating a Game</b></p>
<p class="ListPlainFirst">In this project, you’ll extend your knowledge of data structures, conditionals, functions, and the Canvas API by making your own version of the classic game <i>Pong</i>. You’ll develop two implementations of the game: one with standalone functions (<span class="listplain_Xref"><a href="chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a></span>) and one that uses classes and object-oriented design principles (<span class="listplain_Xref"><a href="chapter11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a></span>). This will illustrate different ways of organizing your code.</p>
<p class="ListHead"><b><a href="part5.xhtml">Project 2</a>: Making Music</b></p>
<p class="ListPlainFirst">This project introduces basic audio programming and sound synthesis techniques (<span class="listplain_Xref"><a href="chapter12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a></span>), then harnesses those techniques to write a song using JavaScript (<span class="listplain_Xref"><a href="chapter13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a></span>). You’ll learn about the Web Audio <span aria-label=" Page 156. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_156" role="doc-pagebreak"/>API and the Tone.js library, which simplifies the process of generating sounds. This will give you practice incorporating third-party JavaScript libraries into your applications.</p>
<p class="ListHead"><b><a href="part6.xhtml">Project 3</a>: Visualizing Data</b></p>
<p class="ListPlainFirst">This project guides you through the process of developing interactive data visualizations with the popular D3 JavaScript library. You’ll explore how to draw with Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and use D3 to organize SVG shapes into bar charts (<span class="listplain_Xref"><a href="chapter14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a></span>). Then you’ll build a dynamic visualization using data retrieved over the internet through the GitHub Search API (<span class="listplain_Xref"><a href="chapter15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a></span>). Incorporating API requests into your applications is a very common programming task, so the project will prepare you to write code that interfaces with real-world data.</p>
<p class="TX">You can find the complete downloadable code for all of these projects, along with solutions to the Try It Yourself exercises, at <a href="https://codepen.io/collection/ZMjYLO"><i>https://<wbr/>codepen<wbr/>.io<wbr/>/collection<wbr/>/ZMjYLO</i></a>.</p>

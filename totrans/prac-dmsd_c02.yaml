    even warrant a passing mention on the local news. Quiet and intimate hardships,
    from losing a job to getting injured in a car wreck, profoundly affect millions

    weather is, at the end of the day, just a work of speculative fiction. In contrast,
    a plan that draws lessons from the plight of a coworker impacted by layoffs is
    quite likely to survive a collision with reality.

    eventually turn their life around. However, recovery can involve months or years

    storm—or of air conditioning in the midst of a heatwave—can be a deadly threat
    to the vulnerable and the unprepared. Subtle interdependencies need to be kept
    in mind too; for instance, many gas-fired furnaces and water heaters, and even
    some gas stoves and gas fireplaces, won’t function when the electricity is out.
    Similarly, for rural folks who depend on well water, the loss of electricity means
    the loss of water pressure after a couple of flushes afforded by the pressure

    the 2013 Colorado floods took out quite a few small bridges and rural roads. Having

    a private car bridge leading to a rural parcel or a subdivision means you may

    must be safer than they truly are. The perception of risk is probably also skewed
    by childhood memories, as this is when we suffered most of our falls and other
    mishaps of this variety. Needless to say, falling when you’re 50 pounds and have

    it’s not a uniformly distributed phenomenon; for one, young men are far more likely

    many incidents are an indignity more than a life-or-death situation—many assaults
    may amount to being shoved, slapped, spat on, or groped—but in the end, physical
    violence is far more common than it might seem. And because being assaulted is

    awareness and robust de-escalation skills are key to reducing this risk.

    the realm of events that, on a lifetime basis, are more likely than not. Annually,
    property crime affects around 10 percent of all households, spanning anything
    from porch piracy and minor vandalism all the way to burglaries of cars and homes.
    For burglaries, the vast majority are of the smash-and-grab variety, with losses
    averaging a bit over $2,500, as noted in Chapter 1; so, being a victim can be
    painful but is seldom a life-changing event. That said, many simple strategies

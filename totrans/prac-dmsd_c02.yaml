    there until disposed of in accordance with your wishes or the normal operation
    of law. In some jurisdictions, simple probate cases that involve just your spouse
    and a modest estate can be wrapped up reasonably quickly, but at other times,
    the proceedings can take a year or more. Family disputes or mysterious disappearances
    can make the process drag out even longer.

- en: Many financial advisors would try to sell you on the idea of setting up a living
    trust, a separate legal entity that holds your assets and disposes of them in
    a prescribed way in the event of your death. But this is a costly and involved
    solution that sometimes makes people throw their hands up in the air and give
    up. Luckily, simpler alternatives—such as having a joint tenant bank account or
    designating a named beneficiary—can achieve pretty solid results. (We’ll cover
    wills, trusts, and other financial planning topics in Chapters 7 and 13.)

    your wishes regarding the custody of any minor children. The courts aren’t required
    to listen to you, but they usually do, especially if you make a well-reasoned
    case. Thinking this through and discussing your ideas with the potential caretakers
    helps avoid the prospect of having children placed in foster care—or worse yet,
    with an abusive and dishonest relative.

- en: The list of disasters named in this chapter is meant as a starting point; it
    may well be incomplete when you consider your family situation, medical needs,
    and other circumstances unique to you. For instance, if you provide day-to-day
    care for a disabled person, any scenario that could jeopardize your ability to
    visit them, even for a brief while, is worth thinking about. Conversely, if you
    depend on the care or goodwill of others, anything that gets in the way of this
    relationship should be discussed in advance, along with any alternative arrangements
    that could be made.

  zh: 本章列出的灾难清单只是一个起点；当你考虑到自己的家庭状况、医疗需求和其他独特的情况时，它可能并不完整。例如，如果你每天照顾一位残疾人，任何可能危及你探访他们的能力的情况，即使是短暂的，都值得思考。相反，如果你依赖他人的照料或好意，那么任何可能妨碍这种关系的事情都应该提前讨论清楚，并探讨可能采取的替代安排。
- en: With all this in mind, now would be a good time to grab a piece of paper or
    open a blank document and try to jot down some initial notes about the scenarios
    that don’t involve large-scale disasters but could still mess up your life. Instead
    of relying on TV tropes, make it about you, your family, your relatives, and your
    career. If you make a list, hang on to it. It’s going to be very useful later
    on.

  zh: 牢记这些，现在正是拿起纸笔或者打开空白文档，尽量记下关于那些不涉及大规模灾难，但仍可能让你的生活陷入混乱的情况的一些初步笔记的好时机。不要仅仅依赖电视里的陈词滥调，把它聚焦在你、你的家人、亲戚和职业上。如果你列出了清单，请保存它。以后它会非常有用。

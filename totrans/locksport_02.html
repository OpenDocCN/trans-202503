<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/01fig00.jpg"/></div>
<p class="noindent">When was the first time you saw someone pick a lock? Perhaps it was in a spy movie. Maybe you stumbled upon a YouTuber talking through the process. Or maybe you happened upon a lockpick village at a hacker conference. Regardless of where it was, you probably felt some mix of excitement, intrigue, and perhaps skepticism. For some of us, these feelings led to pursuing lockpicking for fun, which turned into a hobby, and that hobby became a sport.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Locksport</em> is the nondestructive opening of locks in ways the manufacturer never intended. We use this term to describe both the hobby of opening locks and the competitions to see who can do so the fastest. While <em>lockpicking</em> is the best-known form of locksport, the sport includes other types of lock opening, such as <em>impressioning</em> (creating a working key for a lock without access to or knowledge of the original) and <em>safe-lock <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_4"/>manipulation</em>, or <em>safe cracking</em> (determining a safe’s combination based on feedback from the safe’s dial).</p>
<p class="indent">The goal of this book is to teach you the basics of these techniques and then ramp up your skills until you’re ready to participate in locksport competitions.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev1">The History of Locksport</h3>
<p class="noindent">Lockpicking has a long history, but in the days before the World Wide Web, it was hard to get information about it, much less find the tools. Lockpicking was known in the world of locksmiths, but they preferred not to talk about it to outsiders.</p>
<p class="block1">When I started lockpicking, I talked about it with my local locksmith, Mr. de Kok. He was very reluctant to discuss the subject. Mr. de Kok sold Mul-T-Lock cylinders that he assembled himself. Sometimes he would make a mistake, leaving him with unusable cylinders. Only after I started picking them open for him so he could reuse the parts did he start slowly opening up to me, revealing that he knew about lockpicking and had tried it himself. Still, he’d only talk about it when no other customers were in his shop.</p>
<p class="source">—<small>WALTER</small></p>
<p class="indent">In the 1980s and 1990s, you could find a few resources on lockpicking if you knew where to look. One early example was Ted the Tool’s 1991 paper “The MIT Guide to Lockpicking,” a nicely illustrated guide that was many people’s introduction to lockpicking and that has now been translated into many languages. A few lockpicking books were available, such as those written by Eddie the Wire (it seems you need a pseudonym to write about lockpicking) and published by Loompanics Unlimited, a US book seller specializing in other controversial topics such as weapons, anarchism, and sex. Eddie’s introduction to <em>The Complete Guide to Lock Picking</em> (1981) reads, “When Eddie the Wire was twelve, his dad gave him three padlocks and no keys. The resulting frustration of a twelve-year-old led to Eddie’s early interest in escape artists, locks, and picks.” Eddie must have been that age sometime in the 1960s. One can only guess where he got his information, if he didn’t figure it all out himself.</p>
<p class="indent">Even earlier, lockpicking was studied by the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC), founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1946. The group’s interests encompassed more than just railroads; members also investigated computers, radios, and phone systems. They also liked <em>roof and tunnel hacking</em>, which sometimes involved lockpicking or lock bypassing. One TMRC member was theoretical physicist Richard Feynman, who, later in his career at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, opened colleagues’ safe locks as a hobby. Truth be told, this was more a matter of smart tricks and social engineering than actual lock manipulation. He describes his safe-cracking adventures vividly in his autobiography <em>Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!</em> (W.W. Norton, 1985).</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_5"/>Hacker culture is the legacy of the TMRC, and lockpicking can be seen as a type of hacking: the intellectual challenge of opening a lock in a way that the manufacturer hadn’t envisioned. Hacker culture thrives today, and many cities now have their own hackerspaces where you’ll find curious people with an interest in technology, art, science, and more. It’s no wonder that quite a few people who visit hackerspaces are also interested in lockpicking.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s hard to know what those in the lock industry knew of lockpicking prior to those early documents, but old patents on lockpicking tools might give us a clue. Take the <em>pick gun</em>: a gun-shaped device to quickly open locks (we’ll talk more about this tool in <a href="part2.xhtml">Part II</a>). <a href="ch1.xhtml#ch1fig1">Figure 1-1</a> shows its patent from 1943. Those in the lock industry have known for a long time about the pick gun, but it took many decades to become public knowledge.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch1fig1" src="../images/01fig01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 1-1: Patent 2,309,677 for a “Lock Picking Gun”</em></p>
<p class="indent">Another example is the <em>bump key</em>, a cut or filed-down key that can be used to open some locks when tapped in with a hammer. Its patent from 1928 is shown in <a href="ch1.xhtml#ch1fig2">Figure 1-2</a>. The bumping technique was unknown in the locksport world until it was described in the 2005 article “Bumping Locks” by Barry Wels and Rop Gonggrijp, although those in the lock industry had known about it for decades by then.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_6"/></p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch1fig2" src="../images/01fig02.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 1-2: Patent 1,667,223 for a “Lock Device”</em></p>
<p class="indent">Probably the oldest well-known lockpicking story is that of the <em>challenge lock</em> created by Joseph Bramah. In 1790, Bramah put a lock in his store window, mounted on a board inscribed with “The artist who can make an instrument that will pick or open this lock shall receive 200 guineas the moment it is produced.” In 1851, locksmith Alfred C. Hobbs was the first to pick the Bramah lock, using a special tool he made himself. This 2-in-1 pick and tension tool is still called a <em>Hobbs hook</em> in several languages. (We’ll explain picks and tensioners in <a href="ch6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent">It’s clear that lockpicking is probably as old as locks themselves. But lockpicking as a sport is much more recent.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec1"><em>Lockpicking Groups and Hackers</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Founded on February 9, 1997, the Sportsfreunde der Sperrtechnik—Deutschland e.V. (SSDeV) is the oldest official lockpicking sport group. The name means “sport friends of lockpicking” in German; being the first lockpicking group ever, members included the word <em>sport</em> to make it clear that they weren’t just a bunch of shady people talking about breaking locks.</p>
<p class="indent">SSDeV originated from the Chaos Computer Club (CCC), a Hamburg-based hacker group founded in 1981. In 1994, Steffen Wernéry, one of CCC’s founders, attended the first Hackers on Planet Earth (HOPE) conference in New York, where he bought his first lockpick set. Back in Germany, he found books by Eddie the Wire in the CCC library and became fascinated <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_7"/>with lockpicking. Two years later, at the yearly CCC congress, Wernéry co-hosted a lockpicking lecture and some workshops. These were a success, and a few months later, he and other enthusiasts founded SSDeV. By 1999, Germany had 10 local lockpicking groups; at the time of this writing, there are 14.</p>
<p class="indent">SSDeV has inspired locksport groups in other countries. Every four years since 1994, members of the Dutch hacker group Hack-Tic have organized a large outdoor hacker camp. In 1998, SSDeV hosted a tent at this camp to teach lockpicking. One attendee, Dutch hacker Tim Matthews, officially registered the Dutch lockpicking group Nederlandse Vereniging van Hang en Sluitsport (NVHS), which translates to “Dutch Association for Hinges and Locksport,” in Amsterdam a year later. (The acronym NVHS was chosen as a joke: the Dutch Society for Sexual Reform is abbreviated NVSH.) The locksport group, with its close connections to the Dutch hacker scene, met in Amsterdam at the Hippie Hangout, a space rented by the hacker group Hippies from Hell and a precursor to modern-day hackerspaces.</p>
<p class="indent">In 2002, NVHS was disbanded because of internal disagreements, and a splinter group founded The Open Organisation of Lockpickers (TOOOL). That year, TOOOL co-founder Barry Wels started the Dutch Open, an annual lockpicking championship with lectures and workshops.</p>
<p class="indent">The annual Las Vegas hacker convention DEF CON began impromptu lockpicking competitions in 2003, organized by the Colorado Springs DC719 DEF CON group. The term <em>lockpick village</em> was first used in 2005, when TOOOL hosted a dedicated lockpicking tent at the What The Hack Dutch hacker conference.</p>
<p class="indent">Also in 2005, Josh Nekrep, Kim Bohnet, and Devon McDormand, contributors to the Lock Picking 101 website, formed a club for lockpicking hobbyists and coined the term <em>locksport</em> to differentiate it from locksmithing organizations. Their group, Locksport International, has several chapters around the US.</p>
<p class="indent">In 2006, a TOOOL chapter opened in Eindhoven (Netherlands). Barry Wels’s personal blog, Blackbag (<a href="https://blackbag.nl"><em>https://blackbag.nl</em></a>), had gained a lot of attention, making TOOOL a household name in locksport. At that time, Blackbag was one of the only places on the internet discussing lockpicking.</p>
<p class="indent">Blackbag’s popularity prompted lockpicking groups in other countries (such as the US, UK, Belgium, Norway, and Australia) to adopt the TOOOL name. These groups are independent entities but operate under the same basic rules and share the TOOOL logo as well as the name. TOOOL NL in the Netherlands controls the usage of the TOOOL name, and its website (<a href="https://TOOOL.nl/Toool"><em>https://TOOOL.nl/Toool</em></a>) lists TOOOL organizations around the world.</p>
<p class="indent">TOOOL US officially formed in 2006 at the conclusion of the sixth HOPE conference, with Wels naming HOPE’s lockpick village organizers—Babak Javadi, Eric Michaud, Eric Schmiedl, and Schuyler Towne—members of the board.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the founding of SSDeV and TOOOL, many more lockpicking groups have formed around the world. For instance, the Association of Czech Lockpickers (ACZ, <a href="http://lockpicking.team"><em>http://lockpicking.team</em></a>) was created in 2010. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_8"/>Schlösser Picken Als Schweizer Sport (SPASS, <a href="https://lockpicking.ch"><em>https://lockpicking.ch</em></a>), which translates to “lockpicking as Swiss sport,” started in Switzerland in 2011. In some countries, the illegality of lockpicking made starting a sport group problematic. In France, for example, a lockpicking forum has been active since 2006, but another eight years passed before the law allowed the possession of lockpicking tools, and the Association des Crocheteurs de France (ACF, <a href="https://crocheteursdefrance.fr"><em>https://crocheteursdefrance.fr</em></a>), or Association of French Lockpickers, formed two years later in 2016.</p>
<p class="indent">Many more lockpicking sport groups exist nowadays, either as national or local groups. If you live somewhere that lockpicking is legal but that has no local lockpicking group, consider finding a local hackerspace group (<a href="https://wiki.hackerspaces.org"><em>https://wiki.hackerspaces.org</em></a>) and introducing lockpicking. You may well find other interested people and be credited with introducing locksport to your region!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec2"><em>Competitions</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">These days, plenty of lockpicking competitions take place around the world. The first competitions were held as early as 1997—not surprisingly, by SSDeV. The group held competitions in three styles: <em>Handöffnung</em>, traditional lockpicking; freestyle, which allows the use of tools such as pick guns; and <em>Blitzöffnung</em>, a knockout system with a time limit of one minute per lock. In 2000, the SSDeV added <em>Hangschlossöffnung</em>, padlock opening.</p>
<p class="indent">In those early days, impressioning was still a bit of a mystery. Impressioning is the art of creating a working key for a given lock by wiggling a blank key in the lock, looking at the tiny marks that result, and then filing them away. Back then, lockpickers tried out techniques such as using marker pens and chemicals on the key to help better identify the marks. (We’ll explain how to master this skill in <a href="part3.xhtml">Part III</a>.) In 2005, SSDeV added an impressioning competition to its portfolio, and Oliver Diederichsen of SSDeV dedicated his time to methodically figuring it out. He compiled his findings, along with fabulous pictures, in his self-published book <em>Impressioning</em>, enabling many more people to become successful in the technique. TOOOL introduced its impressioning championship in 2007.</p>
<p class="indent">Many lockpicking groups have yearly competitions, the exact rules of which differ for each group. Some groups may use only cylinders, whereas others might include padlocks or have an entirely separate padlock competition. Locks can be limited to regular pin tumbler locks, include dimple locks, or be exclusively dimple locks. (We’ll look at types of locks in <a href="ch2.xhtml">Chapters 2</a>, <a href="ch3.xhtml">3</a>, and <a href="ch4.xhtml">4</a>.) In some cases, competitors bring their own locks; in others, the locks are provided. Sometimes all contestants pick a lock at the same time, while other times they take turns opening multiple locks in succession.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Lever lockpicking</em> is a relatively new kind of competition that’s gaining interest. The basic techniques for opening regular locks can also be applied to lever locks, although differences exist, as we’ll discuss in <a href="ch3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>. One notable difference is that lever lockpicking requires expensive tools. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_9"/>locks themselves are also expensive, which is why lever locks and tools are often provided by the organizers of such competitions.</p>
<p class="indent">Additionally, cracking safe locks has crossed over from the world of locksmiths and safe technicians. These competitions are rarer because of the organizational difficulties: opening a safe lock takes considerable time, and the contestants must be opening exactly the same lock(s), because different locks will take vastly different times to open. As a result, these competitions aren’t typically held at a specific time but instead over a lengthier period, with the same safe lock given to the participants in turn.</p>
<p class="indent">Other competitions are held as well, such as escape room–style competitions. These are especially popular at hacker conferences. Check your local locksport group to see what it has to offer.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec3"><em>Rules</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Most locksport conferences—and the organizations that run them—have rules that participants must follow or risk being asked to leave. These rules are meant to protect locksporters, locks, lock owners, and locksport clubs. After all, a few bad members could easily tarnish the reputation of an entire club.</p>
<p class="indent">While rules vary among locksport clubs and organizations, a few are common to almost all groups:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet">Pick only locks you own or have the owner’s permission to pick. This rule is simple; not following it is breaking and entering.</li>
<li class="bullet">Don’t pick locks that are in use. While the techniques discussed throughout this book are generally nondestructive, the possibility always exists that a lock can be damaged and rendered inoperable during picking or impressioning. If you lock yourself out, call an actual locksmith.</li>
<li class="bullet">Don’t claim to be a locksmith. Many municipalities have specific licensing requirements for locksmiths. Offering these services outside of a proper locksmithing business can get you into trouble.</li>
<li class="bullet">Be mindful of who you teach. Don’t demonstrate lock-opening techniques to anyone who intends to use them to break the law.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Be sure you’re following these rules and any others set by your club or competition organizers, or you won’t make it very far in locksport!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev2">Legality</h3>
<p class="noindent">When you first tell people that you pick locks, a common initial reaction is “Isn’t that illegal?” While this response is somewhat understandable given the way lockpicking is often portrayed in media, the answer is usually no. In much of the world, simply possessing lockpicking tools isn’t a crime. Having the tools becomes a legal issue only when they’re used to commit a crime. Indeed, many tools sold at hardware stores are legal to own but illegal to use for nefarious purposes. Lockpicks are usually no different.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_10"/>That said, not all countries (or even states, provinces, counties, cities, and so on) view lockpicking tools in this light. In Poland and Japan, for example, such tools are prohibited. In this section, we’ll highlight laws from some of the countries where locksport competitions or conferences are routinely held.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>We aren’t lawyers! While the locksport community has done extensive research into the legality of possessing and using lockpicking tools in many regions, laws are subject to change. Be sure to do your research and make sure you’re staying safe and legal</em>.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec4"><em>US Laws</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Federally, the US doesn’t have a blanket rule banning the possession or use of lockpicking tools. US laws prohibit sending these tools by mail or other shipping services to non-locksmiths (39 US Code § 3002A and 18 US Code § 1716A), but to the best of our knowledge, these laws aren’t enforced. Most manufacturers do, in fact, ship their tools by mail.</p>
<p class="indent">While the lack of a federal ban is good news, the downside is that each state is free to make its own laws, resulting in a patchwork of regulations across the country. Fortunately, TOOOL US has put together a fabulous page detailing the laws for each state (<a href="https://TOOOL.us/lockpicking-laws.php"><em>https://TOOOL.us/lockpicking-laws.php</em></a>). This page also contains a convenient reference map, shown in <a href="ch1.xhtml#ch1fig3">Figure 1-3</a>.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch1fig3" src="../images/01fig03.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 1-3: TOOOL US lockpicking laws map</em></p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_11"/>As you can see from the map, possessing lockpicking tools is legal in most states as long as the carrier demonstrates no intent to use those tools for a crime. That said, exercise additional care when carrying or using these tools in Virginia, Ohio, Mississippi, Tennessee, or Nevada. Laws in these states often require you to prove your innocence rather than having a prosecutor prove your guilt. Tennessee had a similarly restrictive law, but it appears to have been revoked in June 2021 (see <em><a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/commerce/documents/regboards/lock/posts/Locksmith-Letter_6-7-2021.pdf">https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/commerce/documents/regboards/lock/posts/Locksmith-Letter_6-7-2021.pdf</a></em>). This change has not yet been reviewed by the TOOOL US legal team and is therefore not yet reflected on their map.</p>

These two sources are your best bet for information about laws that impact locksport in the US.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec5"><em>Dutch Laws</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">No law in the Netherlands forbids the possession of lockpicking tools. If you use them without permission on a lock you don’t own, however, that’s obviously illegal.</p>
<p class="indent">Cities in the Netherlands sometimes have additional municipal laws called <em>Algemene Plaatselijke Verordening</em>, or <em>APV</em>. In Amsterdam and Eindhoven, where TOOOL NL resides, Articles 2:77 and 2.44, respectively, state that a person isn’t allowed to possess lockpicking tools in a public space unless they can demonstrate on the spot and to an officer’s satisfaction that they don’t intend to use the tools to gain unlawful entry, unlawfully open or break closures, or facilitate or obscure traces of theft. To our knowledge, you can carry lockpicking tools and use them to practice locksport anywhere in the Netherlands.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec6"><em>UK Laws</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">England and Wales have a different legal system from Scotland, and neither system specifically prohibits lockpicking tools. The only offense that you could be committing for simply carrying such tools would be “going equipped” for stealing, as per Section 25 of the Theft Act 1968.</p>
<p class="indent">If you’re found carrying lockpicking tools outside your home, for it to be considered a crime, the police must prove that you intend to use the tools to commit either theft or burglary. That’s a pretty high bar, so simple possession shouldn’t cause you any issues as long as you can demonstrate, to either the police or a court, that you’re interested in the hobby and participate in locksport groups or contests. Concurrent possession of a hard <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_12"/>copy of this book would, for instance, show you were likely a sport picker. Concurrent possession of a balaclava and crowbar would tilt the opinion in the opposite direction. If you’re just sitting in a local pub in the afternoon with several others, picking locks peacefully, you’ll be fine. If the pub is closed and you’re caught sitting in the bar? Busted.</p>
<p class="indent">We know of only one case where this offense has been taken to court, and the defendant was found not guilty.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec7"><em>German Laws</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Germany has no generic law that forbids the possession or use of lockpicking tools, whether in a public or private environment. If you use them without permission on a lock you don’t own, again, that’s clearly illegal.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec8"><em>Australian Laws</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Australian law appears to state that possession of “housebreaking” tools is allowed if the possessor has a legitimate reason. Specifically, Section 3.5 of the <em>Review of Maximum Penalties for Preparatory Offences Report</em> states:</p>
<p class="block2">A person who, without lawful excuse, has an implement of housebreaking in his or her possession is guilty of an offence. The onus is on the person to prove the lawful excuse for having the implement in his or her possession.</p>
<p class="indent">We’re not aware of any locksporter facing trouble for possessing lockpicking tools in Australia.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev3">Groups and How to Find Them</h3>
<p class="noindent">You’ve read the rules and the laws and are ready to begin your locksport journey. The best way to get started is to join a local group of fellow lock enthusiasts. Don’t rush ahead and order your tools just yet! We’ll get into choosing the right ones in later chapters.</p>
<p class="indent">Locksport is about community much more than it is about competition or bragging rights (though plenty of room remains for that as well). An afternoon spent with a handful of picking tools and a tableful of locks is best enjoyed with friends—and maybe a few frosty beverages. As long as you bring a genuine interest in the challenge of opening locks, the locksport community is one of the most helpful, accepting, and friendly groups you can find.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec9"><em>US Groups</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">The largest and best-known locksport group in the US is TOOOL US (<a href="https://TOOOL.us/meetings.html"><em>https://TOOOL.us/meetings.html</em></a>). It has chapters in more than two dozen cities and runs locksport villages at numerous information security conferences, such as DEF CON and ShmooCon. TOOOL US also hosts the annual LockFest conference and competition.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_13"/>Locksport International, or LI (<a href="http://locksport.com/index.php/discover-l-i/local-chapters"><em>http://locksport.com/index.php/discover-l-i/local-chapters</em></a>), is another organization with chapters in several states. One of its most popular chapters is the Longhorn Lockpicking Club in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p class="indent">If none of these groups meet in your area, you can check a few other places. Try searching for <em>locksport</em> or <em>lockpicking</em> on Meetup (<a href="https://www.meetup.com"><em>https://www.meetup.com</em></a>); most clubs list their meetings there. Alternatively, check with any local hackerspaces, since a big crossover occurs among makers, hackers, and lockpickers. If you find nothing at all in your area, consider forming your own group. Once you find a few others who are interested, check the national organizations’ sites to learn how to become an official chapter.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec10"><em>Dutch Groups</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">TOOOL NL (<a href="https://TOOOL.nl"><em>https://TOOOL.nl</em></a>) currently has chapters in Amsterdam and Eindhoven that hold biweekly meetings. The group has hosted the Dutch Open lockpicking championship since 2002. These competitions have evolved into an annual three-day event called <em>LockCon</em>, which includes the Dutch Open as well as many workshops and lectures. LockCon is held in the Netherlands in autumn.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec11"><em>UK Groups</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">The TOOOL UK group (<a href="http://www.TOOOL.uk"><em>http://www.TOOOL.uk</em></a>) open meeting has been running for over a decade at fizzPOP, the Birmingham makerspace, on the first Wednesday of every month. The group also runs an active Discord server called <em>TOOOL UK</em> (<a href="https://discord.gg/mp2fhED"><em>https://discord.gg/mp2fhED</em></a>) and holds a virtual meeting once a week.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec12"><em>German Groups</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">SSDeV (<a href="https://blog.ssdev.org"><em>https://blog.ssdev.org</em></a>) has local chapters all around Germany as well as a special interest group dedicated to underwater lockpicking. Each SSDeV chapter has its own meetings. Some of these are <em>lockpicknicks</em>, outdoor gatherings for lockpickers to eat, socialize, and of course pick locks. Lockpicking and impressioning championships are held yearly. SSDeV lists all competing lockpickers and their scores—<em>Listung der Meister</em>, or <em>Listing of Masters</em>—on its website.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec13"><em>Australian Groups</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Australia has its own TOOOL organization, founded in 2019 (<a href="https://www.TOOOL.com.au"><em>https://www.TOOOL.com.au</em></a>). It hosts regular meetups in Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney, and Newcastle; check the website to find the next meetup or join the group.</p>
<p class="indent">OzSecCon (<a href="https://www.ozseccon.com"><em>https://www.ozseccon.com</em></a>) is Australia’s original conference devoted to physical security. It is held almost every year in Melbourne. In addition to talks and workshops, it also includes lockpicking and impressioning competitions.</p>

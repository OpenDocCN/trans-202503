<p class="Epigraph">Putting in a shitload of hours was very valuable, culturally, in Android.</p>
<p class="EpigraphSource">—Ficus Kirkpatrick</p>

<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">T</span>he main thing that the Android team was known for, within Android but also across Google, was for working really, really hard. Ficus Kirkpatrick called it “The currency of Android.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’m that smart of an engineer, but I work my ass off. I’d make up for my lack of education by just working hard and putting in an unhealthy amount of hours. There were times in the first four to five years where it was essentially all I did when I was awake. And I didn’t get as much sleep as I should. I know I wasn’t alone on that.</p>
<p>“There was this month that I worked every day. The latest I got to work in the morning was 9:30 and the earliest I left was at 1:30 <span class="KeyCaps">am</span>. I remember getting home at 2:30 <span class="KeyCaps">am</span> and I just wanted to do something that was not work, to reclaim my life. I sat in bed playing this game, <em>Game Dev Story</em>. I could hardly keep awake, but I was, out of spite, like, ‘I’m going to have fun playing this game!’ And I realized that what I was actually doing for the last 20 minutes was simulating overseeing a software project.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c34-footnote-1" id="c34-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>“For the most part, overwork was self-inflicted. We really wanted to do as much as we possibly could. I always compared it to some endurance athletic event; miserable in the moment, and you’re glad when it’s over, but you bond with the people. It’s some low-level mental illness you keep signing up for again and again.”</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_294" title="294"/>Rebecca Zavin agreed: “There was that really fulfilling reward cycle of working intensely together with your comrades on something and delivering. That ‘We’re gonna stay late and get it done and we’re all in this together!’ focus. That is the startup thing.”</p>
<p>Peisun Wu noted that the intensity was self-driven. Nobody was making them stay late or punishing them for going home at a normal time. “We all stuck around because we wanted to see something actually work.”</p>
<p>Jason Parks: “We worked a lot of fucking hours. There would be weeks when the only time my wife saw me was when she came and had dinner with me. I would come home late, sleep for a couple of hours, and go back into the office. The only time she saw me was coming in for dinner.”</p>
<p>Fadden remembered Brian Swetland’s efforts and focus: “One day, Andy Rubin pops in and says, ‘Hey Swetland, how’s it going?’ Without looking up, Swetland grumbles something to the effect that things would be going much better if he wasn’t getting interrupted all the time and continues typing. Andy just stands there. Eventually Swetland looks up and realizes Larry Page is standing there too.”</p>
<p>There were obviously negative impacts on the team from all of the long hours people were putting in. For example, Tracey Cole witnessed it affecting her ability to hire: “When I was first trying to build my admin team, nobody [from other teams at Google] would come here because they all heard that we worked too hard.”</p>
<p>Tom Moss talked about the effect on the team’s morale: “At the end of my tenure there, we had the lowest morale scores. But the magic is launching. Launching fixes all else. How many times were Swetland and other people like, ‘I’m fucking going to quit!’ Then we’d launch and we’d have a party and we’d all feel good, and we’d all sign up for it again.</p>
<p>“It was great. I loved it. We all loved it. We felt like we were the special forces of the Marines, working on this amazing project. It’s us against the world and we get there by the grit of our teeth and camaraderie. Yeah, we were all depressed and overworking and not sleeping. But turnover was actually incredibly low, for as much as we complained and as much as we said, ‘bad morale.’”</p>
<p>In 2010, Tom left Google to found a startup. He talked to Andy when he left.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_295" title="295"/>“My daughter was born right around the G1 launch time. She was four months by the time we launched the G1. As I was leaving, [Andy] was like, ‘How are you going to do this startup thing with a small child at home?’</p>
<p>“I’m like, ‘Unless they invent a 25th hour in the day, I cannot work any harder than I’ve been working for you for these past four years.’</p>
<p>“It was one of those moments where you’re like, ‘Do you even realize?’”</p>
<p>San Mehat reflected on how hard the team worked: “I loved that team. They were really, really great. I don’t think I could do it again. I think it would kill me.”</p>
<p>Finally, 1.0 was done. An eerie silence descended.</p>
<p>Romain Guy remembered the period leading up to the actual 1.0 release. There were three weeks after they stopped working on the release before the device was available for people to purchase. “We had nothing to do. We didn’t know if we were still in business. I remember being at home at 5 <span class="KeyCaps">pm</span>, which had never happened. I didn’t know what to do. What do people do when they’re home?”</p>
<p>Then 1.0 shipped, the device was in stores, and the machine started up again. The team got back to working hard and cranking more releases out. For one thing, there was constant pressure of delivering each release in time for partner hardware launches. Also, there was a team-wide desire to make Android successful. Although you could squint and see shades of things to come, that first product was not game-changing. It was a decent smartphone, but not enough to really capture the world’s attention. So the team kept running, because they had a long way to go to make Android realize its potential.</p>

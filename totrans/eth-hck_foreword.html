		<p class="noindent">We exist in a time where hackers hold more influence than ever before. Hacking can now impact the lives of millions of people by targeting elections, power grids, and all sorts of infrastructure that people rely on for their day-to-day activities, not to mention their well-being.</p>
		<p class="indent">In 2021, hackers used ransomware to take down the United States’ largest gasoline pipeline. This fueled anxiety, canceled flights, and caused shortages. The well-executed attack was personal for many people who experienced its impact firsthand.</p>
		<p class="indent">With this level of influence, it is imperative that we not only teach ethical hacking but also encourage it. <em>Ethical Hacking</em> is an excellent manual for programmers who want to learn the fundamentals of designing hacking tools, as well as how to implement the various techniques used by professional penetration testers. To get you there, the book guides you through a lab setup and many exercises that will equip you with skills you’ll need.</p>
		<p class="indent">By covering small-scale hacks that could occur in a local coffee shop to large-scale hacks at the corporate level, it also offers an amazing scope, and so is an ideal textbook for a security course at the undergraduate or graduate level. I consider this book’s lessons necessary for current and future technology, policy, and leadership professionals.</p>
		<p class="indent">For better or for worse, hacking is here to stay.</p>

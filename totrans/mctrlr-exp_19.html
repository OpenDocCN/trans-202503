<p class="noindent">There are a lot of constraints to designing with Microchip’s PIC microcontrollers, but they were very convenient in the early Nineties. It was something like the Arduino of its day, used in both hobby projects and commercial products. Available in mask ROM, (E)PROM, EEPROM, and flash memory variants, it is still being used today. There are many ways to unlock these chips, but in this chapter we’ll focus on using ultraviolet light to clear the fuse bits while somehow protecting the main program memory that we would like to read.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Before EEPROM and flash memory devices were available, developers would purchase chips with a quartz crystal window like the one in <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig1">Figure 19.1</a>, called the EPROM variant. The single E means that this is an erasable programmable read only memory device, while the double E would denote an electrically erasable device. Electrically, you can <em>clear</em> bits from one to zero. To <em>erase</em> bits from zero to one, you would bathe them under an ultraviolet lamp for fifteen or twenty minutes, after which the chip can be written with a new program.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The exact same die would be sold in standard, opaque packaging as a PROM or OTP (one time programmable) variant. These come pre-erased, but having no window, they cannot be conveniently erased for a new program. As we saw in <a href="ch18.xhtml#ch18">Chapter 18</a>, we can use red fuming nitric acid (RFNA) to open our own hole in the casing without damaging the die or the bonding wires. That’s the basis of all these attacks, and the trick usually lies in erasing one part while preserving another.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">Protection is controlled by the configuration bits, informally called fuses. These bits control code protection (CP), the watchdog timer (WDTE), and the oscillator (FOSC). On a PIC, they are implemented with the same floating gate technology that produces EPROM, but it is important to understand that the configuration bits are not placed inside of the program memory. They are elsewhere on the die.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Early chips such as the PIC16C56 in <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig2">Figure 19.2</a> are the easiest to break because their configuration bits are erased along with program memory by design. After decapsulating the chip by the RFNA drip method, simply paint over program memory with red nail polish and bake it in an EPROM eraser until the device becomes readable. You don’t strictly need to know where the configuration bits are, as only the more recognizable program memory needs to be protected by the mask.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the PIC16C56, EPROM memory is the dark rectangle near the right side of the left photo that’s covered with a drop of nail polish in the right photo. This particular sample came from a Parallax BASIC Stamp, whose firmware I was able to read after 151 seconds in an ultraviolet sanitizer box. A USB hub inside the sanitizer makes it convenient to read the chip as soon as its fuses have been erased, with a shell script giving me a read at the very instant that the chip unlocks. The transition period took three seconds, after which every read was consistently the same.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">Bit corruption can be a problem, in that imperfect masking will erase the bits that are uncovered. Zeroes are reliably zeroes after a dump, but ones are sometimes ambiguous, in that they might be corrupted zeroes. Caps0ff (2017a) notes a trick to help measure this corruption. The PIC16 allows a 7-bit XNOR of the two halves of each 14-bit instruction to be read, even when the chip is locked. By first dumping all of the checksums, then unlocking the chip and finally dumping code, the author was able to identify the damaged words.<sup><a id="ch19fn_1" href="footnotes.xhtml#ch19fn1">1</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">UV erasure of fuses became a concern for Microchip, and by 1996 the devices in <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19tab1">Table 19.1</a> had defenses against the technique, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_183"/>first with covers that block ultraviolet light and later with additional, redundant fuses. Tarnovsky (2008) documents this in the specific case of the PIC16C558, where some of the configuration bits have a shield in the top metal layer for protection. Two of these bits control the code protection, and they run through an AND gate to ensure that both bits must be erased to unlock the device. Rather than work around this optically, Tarnovsky uses a laser cutter to bridge the outputs of the AND gate to VDD.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve discussed devices with EPROM or EEPROM memory. The same technique works against more recent devices with flash memory, as in Huang (2007), where Bunnie unlocks a PIC18F1320. He used ultraviolet light at a very sharp angle to get under the metal, erasing the protection fuses. Electrical tape masked the code memory to prevent it from being erased.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Caps0ff (2017b) repeats this attack against a PIC16C74 and confirms a few details. First, the angle of the light striking the chip must be <em>very</em> acute for devices that include a cover above the fuse bits. At a 90<em><sup>°</sup></em> angle from the surface to the light source there was no effect, and even at 45<em><sup>°</sup></em> not much seemed to happen, but very sharp angles of incidence and longer bake times resulted in a successful unlock.<sup><a id="ch19fn_2" href="footnotes.xhtml#ch19fn2">2</a></sup> He uses red nail polish instead of the electrical tape in Bunnie’s example. Afraid that tape might damage the bond wires, I strongly prefer the nail polish method in my own lab.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">One further complication is that UV might scatter underneath the mask to reach the fuse. Perhaps that’s why the acute angle works, scattering the light beneath the fuse shields in the top metal layer. When this happens, it can damage some bits of the code memory, requiring tedious reverse engineering to figure out which ones ought to have been zeroes.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_184"/>Before attacking a real target, it’s a good idea to locate the fuse (or fuses) in a test chip that has nothing important inside.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Schaffer (2018a) describes two attempts to unlock the Intel 8752 microcontroller with ultraviolet light, one successful and one failure. Like the PIC16, this device’s fuse bit is a floating gate transistor away from the main memory region. The failed attempt has a slightly larger mask, and the fuse is expected to be in this region. Whenever you fail to unlock a chip, save photos of each attempt and combine them to get an idea of where the fuses might be.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Schaffer (2018b) describes an unlock of the Altera EP900 EPLD, an early ancestor of the modern CPLD. The protection bit for this chip is stored in the main EPROM memory along with the bitstream. This bit was found on a sample chip by selectively masking all but one corner until eventually the test chip unlocked under ultraviolet light.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Skorobogatov (2005) resets the fuses of a PIC16F84 with a microscope’s built-in halogen illuminator, focused at maximum power and high magnification on the unshielded fuses. The halogen bulb does emit ultraviolet light, but it’s not clear from the description whether the mechanism is that some fraction of UV passes through the glass lenses or that other portions of light also have some effect of UV erasure. In a casual test, 24 hours of exposure at high magnification did not flip any bits of a PIC16 on my desktop microscope.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Skorobogatov also describes success in using this technique against the CY7C63001A chip used in USB dongles. Where fuses are located away from the main EEPROM, he suggests that they often use similar structure. The shape of a memory cell in the main EEPROM will also be the shape of fuse cells elsewhere on the die, and this can be used to find them.</p>&#13;

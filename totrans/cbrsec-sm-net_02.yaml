    security improvement for the least amount of time, effort, and money. A good network
    segmentation plan allows you to separate high- and low-risk devices and user types,

    tested, updated, and maintained than your Windows operating system, simply because
    the technology is newer and less widely adopted. This fact makes them inherently
    more vulnerable and less secure than other, more widely used technologies. By
    putting these vulnerable endpoints onto a logically or physically separate network,
    you lower the risk of an adversary exploiting them and moving laterally across
    your network to your computer. Once you’ve separated your devices, you can consider
    additional controls—such as an intrusion detection or prevention system—or other
    network security monitoring and alerting solutions, which we’ll cover in [Chapter

- en: A *network hub* is the most basic type of device that enables multiple computers
    to communicate with each another. A hub can be used in small networks relatively
    safely, whereas in larger networks they would likely cause significant issues.
    When host A, connected to a hub, communicates with host B, connected to the same
    hub, the data (packets represented as Ethernet frames) travel from host A to a
    port on the hub, and the hub then broadcasts that data out through all of its
    other ports. This means every other endpoint on the network receives the data
    destined for host B, which isn’t very secure. Additionally, because hubs aren’t
    intelligent, all ports are part of the same *collision domain*. This means that
    if two or more devices attempt to communicate at the same time, the traffic collides,
    causing network performance problems. When a collision occurs, the sending devices
    have to stop communicating and wait a randomized amount of time before attempting
    to communicate again, ideally without causing a second collision, resulting in
    a further delay.
  prefs: []

    deploy, but they aren’t scalable. If you have more than a handful of devices needing
    to communicate, you’re better off getting a switch.

- en: In contrast to hubs, *switches* forward traffic through a network using the
    physical hardware (MAC) addresses of the endpoints connected to them. When a host
    connected to a switch communicates with another host in the network, the data
    travels from the sender to a port on the switch, and the switch then uses the
    MAC address for which the data is destined to determine to which port it should
    forward that data. Switches keep a MAC address table in memory, so they know where
    each endpoint is located on the network. Each port on a switch has its own distinct
    collision domain, meaning that if two hosts communicate simultaneously, there
    won’t be a collision—the packets won’t meet each other during transmission. This
    also means that data isn’t broadcast to every device on a network, which makes
    a switch inherently more secure than a hub.

    segments. For example, your local intranet, where all of your endpoints are connected,
    is a private network. The internet, a very large, publicly accessible computer
    network, is separate from your private network. A router is the conduit between
    these two networks, enabling you to access one from the other and browse the internet.
    Where a switch uses MAC addresses, a router is primarily concerned with IP addresses.
    All internet-connected networks use a router of some type. In a small network,
    the border router that connects your network to your internet service provider
    is likely the only router you’ll need.

    *trust zones*, which keep your most critical data and assets separate from more
    vulnerable devices. Separating devices that require more security and monitoring

    *virtual local area networks (VLANs)*: groups of systems that appear to be on
    the same local area network but are logically separated from systems on other
    VLANs. Switches capable of creating and managing VLANs are called *managed switches*.
    Each VLAN acts like a virtual switch that exists within your physical switch.

    purposes, such as a management or administration VLAN, a business or personal
    VLAN for your primary endpoints, and a guest VLAN for less-secure device types
    such as mobile and IoT devices.

    they’re inherently less secure than your primary devices; this mitigates the risk
    of an adversary using them as a stepping-stone into your network. This network
    segment can afford to have less strict security controls, because it doesn’t contain
    any critical data or information.

    segmentation like this, other considerations need to be made, such as how devices

    to VLANs to logically segment your network and its devices. An inexpensive managed
    switch such as the Netgear GS308E provides this functionality, and installing
    it in your small network is quick and easy. This is the device we’ll use for the
    following example network configuration. You can purchase the GS308E directly
    from Netgear or other online retailers, or second-hand from marketplaces like
    eBay. Alternatively, I recommend researching the Ubiquiti range of networking
    equipment, which, while more expensive, is user friendly and highly capable.

    by using two different physical switches. If your switch is misconfigured, the
    higher and lower security networks and devices might be able to communicate, but
    if two switches are physically separate, this is less likely. However, in small
    networks, we usually don’t have the luxury of buying multiple devices; it’s cost
    prohibitive. So, we do the next best thing and use VLANs to keep our networks
    virtually separate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note Purchasing two unmanaged switches without advanced functionality like VLANs
    could be cheaper than a single managed switch with VLAN capability. Taking this
    route will result in two or more physically separate networks, each with one switch.
    If both networks require internet access, you’ll need separate internet connections
    for each network, or a gateway device capable of keeping the switched networks
    logically separate. In this case, you’d be better off investing in the slightly
    more expensive managed switch in the first place. The use of unmanaged switches
    is not covered in this book because they are plug-and-play with little additional
    setup required and will result in a less secure architecture than a managed switch.

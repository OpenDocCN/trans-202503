<p class="TX">The objectives of the exercise were to:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Gain an understanding of employees’ roles and responsibilities during a cybersecurity incident.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Improve communication and collaboration across the cybersecurity incident response team.</li>&#13;

</ul>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX2F"><i>Provide a short description of the scenario.</i></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="TX">The exercise’s scenario involves a threat actor gaining control of Old Prairie’s Facebook and X accounts, posting disparaging and unwanted content, and threatening to release stolen data unless a ransom is paid.</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX2F"><i>List process deficiencies.</i></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="TX">The tabletop exercise uncovered several deficiencies in Old Prairie’s processes. These included:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Poor password hygiene for Old Prairie’s social media accounts that conflicts with the organization’s password policies</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">A lack of awareness of defined roles and responsibilities for Old Prairie staff during a cybersecurity incident</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">A lack of legal counsel (whether on staff or retained) able to determine whether Old Prairie needs to perform notifications, and to what jurisdiction, when sensitive data is lost</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX2F"><i>Evaluate the severity of identified process deficiencies.</i></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="TX">While none of the identified deficiencies is particularly severe, they present opportunities to reduce the risk of the organization’s social media accounts being compromised and to improve the efficiency of the incident response process.</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX2F"><i>Describe the plan to address the identified deficiencies.</i></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="TX">Relevant stakeholders will examine the identified deficiencies and test any fixes during a follow-up tabletop exercise to ensure the issues were remediated.</p>&#13;

<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX2F"><i>Describe the process of soliciting feedback.</i></p>&#13;
<p class="EX2">The tabletop exercise concluded with a debrief that included all attendees. Later, a smaller group of key stakeholders performed a second debrief. The development team solicited feedback from both groups about potential improvements and other concerns. In addition, participants completed a post-exercise survey. The following sections summarize the resulting feedback, as well as observations made during the tabletop exercise itself.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX2F"><i>Describe any strengths identified during the tabletop exercise.</i></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="TX">The exercise revealed the following areas of success:</p>&#13;
<p class="LH"><b>Collaboration</b></p>&#13;
<p class="UL">This tabletop exercise highlighted the tremendous teamwork at Old Prairie. All attendees actively engaged with the exercise, expressed their opinions, and worked toward a successful end to the incident, even when they lacked knowledge of incident response.</p>&#13;
<p class="LH"><b>External partnerships</b></p>&#13;
<p class="UL">The technical team’s partnership with several external firms, including an external incident response team and a cyber insurance partner, will help any major incident response effort.</p>&#13;
<p class="LH"><b>Commitment of senior management</b></p>&#13;
<p class="UL">Old Prairie’s senior management devoted over two hours to participating in the tabletop exercise and post-exercise debrief, proving their commitment to the process.</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX2F"><i>Describe any identified issues in detail, including findings and observations, their impacts, and any recommendations for improvement.</i></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="TX">We also identified several weaknesses, listed here, along with recommendations for their improvement.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec9">&#13;
<h4 class="H3" id="sec9"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Improperly Managed Social Media Passwords</span></h4>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX2">Old Prairie’s password management policy (Policy #201b) defines authentication requirements for all accounts in the Old Prairie environment and any external account that contains Old Prairie data. Of particular interest, Policy #201b states:</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">All passwords will contain at least 15 characters, numbers, or symbols.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">All passwords will be changed at a frequency of once every six months.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Passwords will not be shared between employees of Old Prairie.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Multifactor authentication, if available, must be enabled.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">All deviations from Policy #201b require the written approval of Old Prairie’s Chief Information Security Officer.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_163" aria-label="163"/>During the exercise, it was determined that:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">At least three employees shared a single password to Old Prairie’s social media accounts.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Employees used the same password for two social media accounts.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">It was possible for a single employee to lock out the other employees by changing the passwords of the social media accounts.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">The password was an easy-to-guess dictionary word without unique symbols, numbers, or capitalization.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Multifactor authentication, while available, wasn’t enabled.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX2">While the participants were aware of Policy #201b, they didn’t understand its applicability to Old Prairie’s social media accounts.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="LH"><b>Impact</b></p>&#13;
<p class="UL">The identified poor password practices make it easier for threat actors to harm the organization. A compromise of Old Prairie’s Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) accounts could significantly impact Old Prairie’s reputation and concern its customer base.</p>&#13;
<p class="LH"><b>Recommendations</b></p>&#13;
<p class="UL">Old Prairie should reexamine Policy #201b and confirm its applicability to social media and other accounts. After performing any necessary updates, Old Prairie should educate all employees about the policy’s scope. Finally, Old Prairie should update all social media accounts to conform to Policy #201b. Old Prairie should periodically audit both internal and external accounts to ensure policy compliance.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec10">&#13;
<h4 class="H3" id="sec10"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Insufficient Knowledge of Data Loss Notification Requirements</span></h4>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX2">According to Old Prairie’s cybersecurity incident response plan, the organization’s general counsel is responsible for spearheading data loss notifications to the impacted party and regulatory authorities. During the scenario, the general counsel expressed some familiarity with Missouri’s data breach notification laws but was unfamiliar with those of neighboring states, where some of Old Prairie’s customer base resides. Comments from Old Prairie staff suggested that the organization doesn’t currently possess the expertise needed to determine the steps to take during a data loss incident.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="LH"><b>Impact</b></p>&#13;
<p class="UL">A cybersecurity incident may require the swift notification of key regulatory authorities within a defined time period. Without knowledge of data breach laws for relevant jurisdictions, Old Prairie might not be able to perform these notifications in a timely manner. During a cybersecurity incident, when time is valuable, the organization may be forced to waste precious time seeking and procuring appropriate legal resources.</p>&#13;
<p class="LH"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_164" aria-label="164"/><b>Recommendations</b></p>&#13;
<p class="UL">Old Prairie’s general counsel should seek out, evaluate, and retain a law firm with expertise in data breach notification for the entire United States.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec11">&#13;
<h4 class="H3" id="sec11"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Lack of Understanding of Roles During an Incident</span></h4>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX2">The cybersecurity incident response plan describes the roles and responsibilities of staff members during an incident. However, few employees were aware of their specific obligations. During the tabletop exercise, the facilitator asked participants about the actions they would take while responding to a cybersecurity incident. It was rare for these actions to align with those defined in the cybersecurity incident response plan, and in several instances, staff members recommended actions that directly contradicted the plan. When prodded, the majority of attendees admitted that they weren’t aware of the plan’s contents.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="LH"><b>Impact</b></p>&#13;
<p class="UL">All organizations seeking to respond comprehensively to an incident must perform incident response planning. While Old Prairie has a cybersecurity incident response plan, employees lack knowledge of it, which might unnecessarily prolong a response. If stakeholders ignore the plan, they might improperly perform important steps.</p>&#13;
<p class="LH"><b>Recommendations</b></p>&#13;
<p class="UL">Old Prairie staff with roles in the incident response plan should be familiar with their responsibilities during a cybersecurity incident. Old Prairie should educate its entire staff on the existence of the plan and dedicate smaller training sessions for employees with roles.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H2" id="sec12"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Conclusion</span></h3>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX2F"><i>Describe opportunities for improvement and next steps.</i></p>&#13;
<p class="EX2">Old Prairie’s tabletop exercise revealed several opportunities for improvement. Some security shortcomings provide fertile ground for an incident (such as poor social media password practices and policy awareness), while others could hinder the organization’s ability to respond to an incident promptly (such as a lack of awareness of roles and responsibilities or specialized legal counsel to assist with data breach obligations).</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="TX">We will conduct a follow-up exercise within six months to allow time to remediate the key findings.</p>&#13;

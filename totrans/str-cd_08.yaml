    Expert systems were popular in the 1980s, and it was hoped then that they would
    prove helpful as a more general approach to artificial intelligence. We’ll discuss
    whether this hope was realized later in the chapter, but for now, note that the
    large-scale application of expert systems never happened.

    a set of rules and facts. The rules are intended to capture the knowledge of a
    human expert in a specific domain, thereby allowing the software to perform similarly
    depending on the facts available. This is an abstract definition, and there is
    certainly room for other nuanced statements related to what an expert system is,
    but you’ll appreciate what an expert system is as we explore CLIPS.

    developer captured the essential knowledge of the domain expert and properly arranged
    that knowledge in the form of rules firing in response to a particular set of
    facts.

    Prolog, which uses backward chaining. *Forward chaining* systems process the data
    embodied in the facts they know to find valid conclusions. In contrast, *backward
    chaining* systems work from the goal to find true statements that support the
    goal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A forward chaining system explores all known facts to select rules to evaluate,
    or *fire*. A system like CLIPS places rules to fire on an *agenda* and then uses
    *conflict resolution* to select which specific rule to fire. Firing a rule may
    update the set of known facts, causing other rules to fire, in which case, CLIPS
    continues to run until the agenda is empty or until it is explicitly told to stop.

    find conclusions by applying a set of rules to a collection of facts. Unlike the
    other programming languages we’ve explored (except Prolog), CLIPS incorporates
    advanced concepts in its inference engine that are worth digging into if you are
    curious; however, these concepts are well beyond what we intend to explore here.

    CLIPS fires a rule only once for each set of matching conditions. This is known
    as *refraction* (this term is borrowed from neuroscience, where it is related

    `x` is the father of `y` if `x` is a parent of `y` and `x` is male. The LHS of
    the rules captures the relationship from the facts binding variables. For example,
    the `father` rule binds both `?x` and `?y`, meaning it will fire if there is a
    set of `(parent x y)` and `(male x)` facts in the facts list where the same `x`
    is parent of `y` and also male. Therefore, for a rule’s LHS, variables with the
    same name must be the same for every part of the condition to be true. When the
    rule fires, it simply outputs the now proven fact that `x` is the father of `y`.
    Notice that nothing is added to or removed from the facts list by these rules.

    file in the *SNOBOL/datasets* directory. Matching the reported labels against
    the known labels in *iris_test_labels.txt* will tell you that the iris expert
    system is 98 percent accurate, meaning it makes one mistake out of every 50 test
    samples. The SNOBOL nearest neighbor classifier is 96 percent accurate on the
    same test data using the same training data. Therefore, in this case, the expert
    system is quite good. Of course, our “expert knowledge” of iris flowers came from
    the training data in the first place, so we didn’t implement a true expert system.
    We merely encapsulated knowledge synthesized from a statistical model. I’ll have
    more to say about this in the discussion up next.

- en: The examples in this section give us a good feel for CLIPS, but, as stated earlier,
    CLIPS is much more than we can explore here. For example, we ignored CLIPS’s object-oriented
    abilities and the fact that CLIPS is designed to play nicely when integrated into
    other applications. A quick review of Google Scholar shows that academic papers
    referencing CLIPS are still being written, to say nothing of industrial uses for
    CLIPS that are likely never discussed in print.

- en: Expert systems are often considered “old-school” or even “failures,” but that
    isn’t fair. You won’t hear the term *expert system* too much these days, but they
    are alive and well under the term *business rule management system.* For example,
    DROOLS (*[https://www.drools.org/](https://www.drools.org/)*) is an open source
    rules-based system in active development with a large user base and supporting
    documentation, including multiple books. As a general approach to artificial intelligence,
    expert systems are passé, replaced by the phenomenal success of deep learning
    and neural networks, which represent a connectionist view of cognition, not the
    computational view embodied by an expert system.

    the rules often contain gaps, missing elements, or paths that are not specified.
    If a rule-based system claims to cover a topic, how would we know we’ve tested
    all the corner cases and all the possible sets of inputs? It becomes difficult,
    perhaps exponentially difficult, as the rules become more complex and intertwined.

- en: The iris expert system shown earlier used “knowledge” extracted from a machine
    learning model. What if, instead, we needed to extract the rules from an expert
    gardener? The expert certainly knows how to identify iris flowers, but how do
    we get that knowledge out of the expert’s head and into a set of rules for CLIPS?
    The process of mapping an expert’s knowledge to rules is known as *knowledge extraction*,
    and it is an Achilles’ heel of sorts for expert systems. The concept of an expert
    system is seductive, but the realization is difficult at best. To be sure, the
    iris expert won’t know that a petal width less than 0.8 cm means the flower is
    almost certainly *I. setosa*, even if able to identify that species with almost
    perfect precision. How is that then captured and coded? Careful interviewing,
    which is highly time consuming, to say nothing of potentially irritating to the
    interviewee, might generate more general rules, but none would be as specific
    as those extracted by the decision tree. For example, one rule asks in a particular
    circumstance if the petal length is less than 4.75 cm, versus less than 4.85 cm
    in another. I doubt any expert would consider a millimeter difference in petal
    length of any importance.

    still maintained. There are likely many CLIPS-based expert systems out there,
    quietly running in the background and invisible to the general public.

- en: Because of its multiparadigm nature, CLIPS is, of course, a Turing-complete
    language. Indeed, one could use CLIPS without any reference to the rules engine
    if desired. As a framework for an expert system, CLIPS has stood the test of time,
    so if you find yourself in a situation where an expert system seems appropriate,
    CLIPS is an option. For us, CLIPS is an atypical language, but one we should be
    familiar with and keep in our back pocket for those times when the appropriate
    situation arises. In terms of thinking about coding, CLIPS requires a different
    approach if we want to use the rules engine. That fact alone warrants including
    CLIPS in our explorations.

- en: 'The CLIPS expert system was the focus of this chapter. We introduced the language
    and the concept of an expert system before exploring the basics: facts and rules.
    The bulk of the chapter saw us work through four examples illustrating the core
    of CLIPS. We learned how rules respond to facts by building an elementary calculator.
    We then re-explored family relationships to illustrate the difference between
    CLIPS and Prolog when generating inferences from collections of facts. The next
    example used a factory simulation to demonstrate arranging the firing sequence
    of rules by manipulating their salience. The final example was our most elaborate.
    We used a learned decision tree to implement a collection of rules, those that
    might have been created by an expert to let us categorize different types of iris
    flowers by answering a few yes or no questions.'

    our esolangs and into the realm of what I’m calling “eccentric programming languages.”
    We’ll begin with ABC, a tiny language that will serve us well to introduce the
    weirdly wonderful world of esolangs.

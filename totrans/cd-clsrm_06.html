<h1 class="ChapterTitle"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Intentional Development Environments</h1>&#13;
</header>&#13;
<p class="ChapterIntroFirst">The web development tools provide a playful introduction to actual software code that empowers students, but it lacks permanence. Anything your students create with these tools vanishes when they refresh or close the browser. In this chapter, we’ll introduce <em class="EmphasisItalic">development environments</em>, where students can build computational artifacts that they can develop, enhance, and share with others<em class="EmphasisItalic">. </em>Fortunately, the coding environments and their features that we’ll explore in this chapter will be very familiar to your students because of their previous experiences with the web development tools.</p>&#13;
<h2 class="HeadA"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Online Code Playgrounds</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">The advantage of the browser’s web development tools is to immerse students in code as quickly as possible. Similarly, empowering students to construct their own web applications easily and at the earliest opportunity is the power of <em class="EmphasisItalic">code playgrounds</em>. These websites allow programmers to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in an online tool where they can save and execute their code without difficulty. A growing number of code playgrounds are coming online. Sites like JSFiddle, JS Bin, CodePen, and W3Schools offer different options and features. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Because these comprehensive development environments are instantly accessible via a web browser, students can open one and start coding, just like they do with the web development tools. Even better, they can save their work at school and later open a browser at home or at the library to continue coding where they left off. As a result, their efforts become more intentional. They begin working toward a goal in a project-based task that requires deeper content engagement.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Many of these development environments will bear some resemblance to the web development tools in that they have various panels for different kinds of script and code. Figure 6-1 shows part of the interface for JSFiddle, a popular code playground.</p>&#13;
<figure>&#13;
<p class="AnchoredGraphic"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="image/CitC06_01_JSFiddle_labeled_new.png"/></p>&#13;
<figcaption class="Caption">Figure 6-1: JSFiddle user interface</figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="Body">Like the web development tools, Figure 6-1 shows multiple panels for different content. In this code playground, the HTML panel <span class="Wingdings">❶</span> defines the document. The CSS panel <span class="Wingdings">❷</span> defines the look and feel of the web page, and the JavaScript panel <span class="Wingdings">❸</span> contains the programming code that makes the page dynamic and defines how it behaves. As we learned in the preceding chapter, the content, style, and programming are decoupled from one another to make them easier to maintain. The output panel <span class="Wingdings">❹</span> shows the result of combining the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this example, the combination of the three panels renders a 3D model of an alien world covered with light and dark squares to explore how a planet’s albedo (its color) affects its average temperature. Clearly, this coding environment allows for some very sophisticated demonstrations.</p>&#13;

<section class="feature1">&#13;
<h2 class="BoxHead">Accessibility</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">The advantage of having your students separate their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible is best illustrated when coding for accessibility. Many different clients will potentially access your application, including humans, robots, and various devices. It’s a common practice to have CSS definitions and HTML attributes specifically for these clients. Here are some users to keep in mind:</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxListPlainA"><strong class="EmphasisBoldBox">Visual impairment</strong> As mentioned in Chapter 1, developers must be vigilant in making sure their software provides ways for blind, color-blind, and poor-sighted users to use it. A great resource on how to accommodate these users is <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">Section 508</em>, an amendment to the <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">Rehabilitation Act of 1973</em>. The section extends the civil rights protections for people with disabilities to require federal agencies to make information technology platforms accessible. If you’re writing software for the US government, it must adhere to the accessibility requirements. These include providing text alternatives in the HTML for images that screen readers can access, avoiding color-coded information, avoiding font and background colors that are too similar, and adding tab indexes to the HTML content that allow users to use the <span class="Keycap">tab</span> key rather than the mouse to quickly find what they need.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxListPlainB"><strong class="EmphasisBoldBox">Different devices</strong> Not everyone who accesses your application will view it on a laptop or desktop using a keyboard and mouse. More and more users are browsing on tiny smartphones where screen space is limited. Columns of content that are so convenient on a wide monitor can be illegible on a small screen. It’s a common practice now to include CSS definitions that check the client’s screen dimensions and reformat the entire site layout for their device. Some users might not even be accessing your content on a screen; instead, they’re printing it on paper. Additional CSS definitions are needed to accommodate them as well.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxListPlainC"><strong class="EmphasisBoldBox">Web crawlers</strong> Not every user that accesses your site is human. Search engines regularly deploy <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">web crawlers</em>, software that systematically indexes all content on the web for inclusion in search results. Some web crawlers will evaluate your site on its accessibility to smartphones and other devices. Sites the crawler considers inaccessible will be dropped further down the results. These crawlers are highly focused on the content aspects of your site and the HTML, so keeping that content clean of styling and programming directives, like CSS and JavaScript code, will make it easier for the bot to index. Additionally, many crawlers can’t handle complex JavaScript and will improperly evaluate content that can’t be accessed without it.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Many free and comprehensive tools are available online and in the browser that students can use to evaluate their sites and applications. <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">Simulators</em> that run on their computer screens allow developers to view how their site will appear on a small screen. Additionally, free sites are available where students can provide the URL to their application and have it evaluated for Section 508 compliance or search engine optimization.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">The subject of accessibility is broad and complex, with new developments happening all the time. For now, students should be aware of the accessibility issue at a high level, but their focus at this point should be on learning the development environment basics.</p>&#13;
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
</aside><p class="Body">You should carefully consider which code playground your students will work in. Because students will be spending a great deal of time working in this environment, you need to choose the most feature-rich and flexible platform for them. The following subsections provide some features to consider when you’re evaluating code playgrounds.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>User Interface Features</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Numerous features are built into development platforms that can make code easier to read and debug. Your students will already be familiar with many of these features from working with the web development tools. For example, <em class="EmphasisItalic">syntax highlighting </em>is a common feature where code is color coded to make different elements readily identifiable. In syntax-highlighted CSS, the <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">html</span> selectors might be red, the <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">id</span> selectors green, the properties blue, and their values purple. The JavaScript might use green for function names, blue for keywords, red for conditional logic, yellow for strings, and purple for integers. This color coding makes the syntax pop out and the code easier to read. It also allows the coder to ignore what isn’t immediately relevant and focus on the task at hand.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Other useful user interface (UI) features include having the interface alert the user to syntactically incorrect code, similar to how most word processors highlight misspelled words. UIs that allow for <em class="EmphasisItalic">code folding</em>, expanding and collapsing code, let students hide the extraneous parts and simplify the view. Typing in the editor makes code completion and automatic code indentation more convenient.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>Simplicity</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Another characteristic to keep in mind when you’re evaluating development environments is their simplicity. A feature-rich development environment might offer a multitude of conveniences, but it also offers an abundance of menu options that can overwhelm a novice programmer. So much of software development involves the art of mitigating complexity. Make sure the development environment you choose helps manage that complexity rather than increasing it.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Recall from Chapter 5 when students first opened the web development tools and we asked them to think about how they felt. The web development tools can be overwhelming, which is why this book restricts students to only using a few of those tabs. Once students are comfortable with the DOM Inspector and web console, they can slowly explore the other features, such as Network, Performance, Memory, Security, and Debugger. Your students can engage with a highly complex development environment if you have them focus on just a few key features at the outset. </p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>Collaboration and Portability Features</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Very little software is written by lone programmers. Even software developers working alone build on solutions that came before them and make existing code their own. A feature available to many code playgrounds is the ability to <em class="EmphasisItalic">fork</em> a project: that is, to take an existing code example, click a button, and get a copy of it to modify along a new path, or <em class="EmphasisItalic">branch</em>. Forking an application from the playground and building it along a new branch provides students with existing code from which to learn new coding skills and lets them extend that solution to make it their own.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Forking and branching code relate to <em class="EmphasisItalic">versioning</em> in software development. Versioning is the use of unique names or labels to track changes in the state of a software project over time. The Chapter 2 exercise “Iterative You” mentioned having students view themselves as iteratively improving through version labels 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and so on. Each version marked a milestone in their self-improvement up to version 1.0 on graduation day. Code playgrounds with built-in versioning features allow students to track their coding progress. More important, students can revert to previous code versions if they accidentally introduce a bug in a more current version.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">When students feel confident in their creations, the code playground should provide them with the means to share their work. Each project should have a unique URL that students can provide to their peers to show off what they’ve made. Taking this a step further, some playgrounds can make creations <em class="EmphasisItalic">embeddable</em>: students can embed their work in other websites, like forums, and can share their work in such a way that their peers don’t even need to follow a link.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Another feature to consider in a playground is <em class="EmphasisItalic">portability</em>. How easy is it to take a solution elsewhere? If students want to move their solution to another playground, can they easily transfer their work? What if the student wants to start working in a local environment, coding on a local hard drive rather than the cloud? Does the playground allow them to download their work to take it elsewhere? As long as students can access their code in the playground, they can migrate, even if it means copy-pasting their code into a new environment. But it’s best to consider at the start how easy it is to move their code.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>Licensing</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Tied to collaboration and the ability to take someone else’s code and make it your own is <em class="EmphasisItalic">licensing</em>. Specifically, you need to help students understand the proper-use policies, terms of service, and copyright status of code posted publicly to the playground. The policies will almost certainly include language that states it’s not acceptable to post copyrighted or offensive content to the site. Actually, your students should be observing such conduct already. But what is the copyright status of original work they find or create on the site?</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Ideally, code posted to the site will be explicitly defined as <em class="EmphasisItalic">free software, open source software</em>, or<em class="EmphasisItalic"> copyleft </em>license, which grants users the right to update and redistribute the software. Even better, the playground might allow users to select a license from a list of permissive and restrictive licensing options.</p>&#13;
<aside epub:type="sidebar">&#13;
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
<section class="feature1">&#13;
<h2 class="BoxHead">Software License Agreements</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Whenever we sign up for a new online service or install new software, we must explicitly acknowledge that we “Read and accept” the Terms of Service (ToS) or End-User License Agreement (EULA). These windows pop up with a seemingly endless scrolling mountain of text; however, very few of us read this text despite it being a legally binding contract between the software provider and the end user and carrying some potentially very serious repercussions. Software license agreements are an important issue for new digital citizens to be aware of and a topic you should challenge your students to think about.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">These agreements can make some shocking assertions. For example, a social network’s software agreement might require the user to grant the company permission to track their usage and share their personal information with third-party advertisers. Then users will see targeted ads based on personal interests tracked from interactions on the social network. These networks might claim co-ownership of the private photos you upload or that the media you’ve purchased in the cloud can be revoked at any time. </p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">When we click the “Accept” button for these agreements, we’re giving our <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">informed consent</em>. We grant specific permissions to the software provider with an understanding of the consequences. Informed consent is a tricky subject regarding software legal agreements. These documents are often extremely verbose and written in <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">legalese</em>, a term for dense and highly technical language that is difficult for non-legal professionals to understand.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">For example, Facebook’s base ToS spans 10 printed pages with more than 3,000 words and nearly a dozen links to other terms and policies covering additional use cases for the social network. Reading and understanding such a document is a significant time investment. So what if the user doesn’t agree to the policies within the agreement? They might decline, but then they can’t use the software. What if there is no alternative software or if all providers make the same unacceptable demands? How do we strike a balance between protecting software providers and their users’ rights?</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Review some software license agreements in class. Take the time to read through one to demonstrate how challenging they are. Find articles that explain some of the more outrageous claims these agreements demand of their users. Some of the clauses in software licenses can seem silly. For example, the Apple App Store license prohibits users from using the product in the manufacture of “nuclear, missile, or chemical or biological weapons.” For a time, the Safari browser for Windows license agreement barred the user from installing the software on a non-Apple-labeled computer.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">Other licensing clauses are not as amusing—for example, when a license attempts to restrict your right to sue the manufacturer. What are the implications of users not being aware of what they’re giving up when they agree to such conditions?</p>&#13;
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
</aside><p class="Body">Many sites simply take no stand on licensing and place the responsibility on users to sort out rights violations between one another. As a best practice, students should include licensing information in their code to make it clear to others what rights are given and withheld when using the software. Similarly, students should look for licensing information for the projects they find in the repository or contact the owner for permission before clicking the fork button. Listing 6-1 shows an example of a free software license comment embedded in code. The <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">/*</span> and <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">*/</span> syntax are opening and closing tags that indicate to the browser that this is a comment intended only for humans reading the code and should be ignored by the browser.</p>&#13;

<p class="Listing">Listing 6-1: Sample MIT License notice comment in JavaScript</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Figure 6-1 shows the MIT License, a license that’s highly popular due to its brevity and compatibility with free and restrictive licenses. For example, a software solution with a restrictive license can include solutions that are MIT Licensed as long as those components are identified as open source. Other open source licensing options include GNU General Public License (GPL), Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), or even releasing to the public domain. Have a dialogue with your students to decide on a license that will ensure collaboration within your classroom and beyond it.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>Software Frameworks</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Some intermediate features that your students might want to explore early on are <em class="EmphasisItalic">software frameworks</em>, which extend and enhance core programming languages. In JavaScript programming, software frameworks can empower your students to easily render 3D models, code video games, or train an artificial intelligence device. Most code playgrounds allow users to select frameworks from a drop-down list to reference in the code. These features are sometimes called <em class="EmphasisItalic">dependencies</em>, because the software students write will depend on including a framework.</p>&#13;
<aside epub:type="sidebar">&#13;
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
<section class="feature1">&#13;
<h2 class="BoxHead">Cross-Browser Compatibility and JavaScript Frameworks</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">In the early days of JavaScript programming, various web browsers would interpret the same code very differently. As a result, web developers would spend much time testing their code for <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">cross-browser compatibility</em>, making sure the code exhibited the same behaviors in all browsers. Often, developers would need to write an <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">if-then</span> statement to detect which browser it was running in and execute an entirely different set of instructions based on the outcome. Listing 6-2 shows a code example that detects whether the browser is Netscape Navigator. This code snippet was found in so much code that almost all modern browsers will evaluate this code to <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">true</span> to prevent such legacy code from breaking. Run this code in the console to see how your browser responds.</p>&#13;
<pre>if(navigator.appName.indexOf("Netscape")&gt;(-1)){&#13;
  document.write(&#13;
    "This is a Netscape browser"&#13;
  ) &#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<p class="BoxListing">Listing 6-2: Old JavaScript browser detection</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Although this code works, it’s now considered bad practice to use it. Instead, developers should run <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">feature detection</em> to see whether the browser supports specific features before running code that takes advantage of them. Listing 6-3 shows an example. Its code detects whether the browser supports <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">speechSynthesis</em>, a feature that reads text to the user through the speakers. Try executing this code in your console to see whether your browser can speak to you.</p>&#13;
<pre>if ('speechSynthesis' in window) {&#13;
  window.speechSynthesis.speak(&#13;
    new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(&#13;
      "Browser supports speech."&#13;
    )&#13;
  );&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<p class="BoxListing">Listing 6-3: JavaScript to detect speechSynthesis in the browser</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">The power of frameworks is that they should abstract away this kind of code into their functions so the developer can focus on what they’re trying to accomplish. When it was introduced in 2006, the jQuery framework, which was feature rich and simplified coding JavaScript, appealed to developers for how it abstracted away the complexity of managing browser compatibility.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">Students should have a solid understanding of the programming language before incorporating frameworks so they can best differentiate what code is base functionality and what is a framework extension. Frameworks can also bring some highly advanced software methodologies into play that students can adopt without fully understanding what the methodology is attempting to solve. Students should be empowered to work with frameworks. But they should also be mindful of how those frameworks extend the core programming language and what specific problem domains their framework addresses.</p>&#13;
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
</aside><p class="Body">Like working with JavaScript code, the framework’s abstractions have their own syntax. The framework has its own documentation for students to learn about its many features. If the framework is well established, like jQuery, students will find many questions answered and examples posted in online forums. Similarly, the framework’s website will have an examples page with demonstrations of what developers can do with its extensions.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Code playgrounds make separating the content, style, and behavior clear; color code the syntax; highlight errors; and make including frameworks easy. But students can also learn some aspects of web application development by working with local files on a computer. After all, developers don’t code proprietary software on free sites in the business world. Becoming familiar with how local development differs from code playground development is important.</p>&#13;
<h2 class="HeadA"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Local Development</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Code playgrounds are invaluable for the way they accelerate development and abstract away many of the web programming details. But once your students know how to develop code in the playground you chose, it’s critical that you familiarize them with developing web applications in a local environment. Doing so will give them a more nuanced and detailed understanding of how web applications are structured. It will also give them access to the wide world of applications other coders have developed and shared outside the playgrounds.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">As with the rationale for introducing web development tools and code playgrounds, making development as convenient as possible is vital to your students’ enjoyment of working in this new local environment. For this reason, you should provide students with a basic template in which to begin their work. This is also good practice, as writing a template from scratch is a painstaking and error-prone process. As students will learn when they become proficient coders, it’s much faster and more accurate to grab code when developin<a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>g.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">The template package you develop and provide to your students should include three files: an <em class="EmphasisItalic">index.html</em> file in the root folder for the content, a <em class="EmphasisItalic">styles.css</em> file in a <em class="EmphasisItalic">css</em> folder for the styling, and a <em class="EmphasisItalic">scripts.js</em> file in a <em class="EmphasisItalic">js</em> folder for the JavaScript code. The <em class="EmphasisItalic">index.html</em> file provides the basic starting HTML from which students can work; it should look very similar to Listing 6-4.</p>&#13;
<pre>&lt;!doctype html&gt;&#13;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;&#13;
  &lt;head&gt;&#13;
    &lt;title&gt;[STUDENT NAME]'s Web App&lt;/title&gt;&#13;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;&#13;
    &lt;meta name="description" content="My first local web app"&gt;&#13;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css?v=0.1"&gt;&#13;
    &lt;script&#13;
  src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.4/jquery.min.js"&gt;&#13;
    &lt;/script&gt;&#13;
    &lt;script src="js/scripts.js?v=0.1"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#13;
  &lt;/head&gt;&#13;
  &lt;body&gt;&#13;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
    &lt;img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150.png" alt="Placeholder" /&gt;&#13;
  &lt;/body&gt;&#13;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>&#13;
<p class="Listing">Listing 6-4: HTML template from which students can begin local development</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Several new elements are in this code for your students to understand; most likely, they were abstracted away in the coding playground. Instead of three panels that separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we have three different files that need to be edited individually in a text editor. The <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">&lt;link rel="stylesheet"&gt;</span> tag indicates the location of the CSS file relative to the <em class="EmphasisItalic">index.html</em> file in the <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">href</span> property, which is in a file named <em class="EmphasisItalic">styles.css</em> in the <em class="EmphasisItalic">css</em> folder. Similarly, the second <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">&lt;script&gt;</span> tag in this example defines the location of the JavaScript file in the <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">src</span> property relative to the <em class="EmphasisItalic">index.html</em> file, which is in a file named <em class="EmphasisItalic">scripts.js</em> in the <em class="EmphasisItalic">js</em> folder. </p>&#13;
<aside epub:type="sidebar">&#13;
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
<section class="feature1">&#13;
<h2 class="BoxHead">Text Editors and IDEs</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Although code playgrounds provide instant access to start developing through the browser window, local development requires students to have access to at least a text editor to modify their code. All operating systems come with a text editor, but these will only provide the minimum functionality. Because students are now accustomed to the syntax highlighting, code completion, and auto-indentation features in code playgrounds, they might become frustrated in a plain vanilla text editor.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Fortunately, many free, feature-rich text editors are available to choose from, such as Atom, Vim, Sublime Text, and Notepad++. When you’re evaluating editors, look for the same features available in the code playground. Sometimes these features will come in the form of <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">plug-ins</em> for the editor: a plug-in is an extension that provides additional functionality, such as JavaScript syntax highlighting, code completion, or integration with online services. In this local development style, coding happens in the text editor and is tested in the browser.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">For a more advanced environment, it’s worth your time to research <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">integrated development environments (IDEs)</em>, which are software platforms—such as Eclipse, Microsoft Visual Studio, and NetBeans—that provide a complete, comprehensive coding environment. In addition to syntax highlighting and code completion, this software might offer refactoring suggestions, track functions and styles available across files, provide code searching, and include visual design tools and debugging features. Similar to moving from code playgrounds to local development, moving from text editors to an IDE might be another step to include on your students’ learning ladder, if time and resources permit.</p>&#13;
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
</aside><p class="Body">Additional details in Listing 6-4 give us an opportunity to explore why the code is the way it is. Consider the first <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">&lt;script&gt;</span> tag, which references the jQuery JavaScript framework hosted on a Google server. Why isn’t this file saved in the <em class="EmphasisItalic">js</em> folder? Why rely on a third-party service to host the file? To understand the strategy here, students need to know about browser <em class="EmphasisItalic">caching</em>. Caching occurs when the browser saves copies of most web content to the local computer to prevent having to download it in the future, which speeds up page loads. By referencing the <em class="EmphasisItalic">jquery.min.js</em> file in this open JavaScript library, there’s a good chance the file will already be stored in a visitor’s browser cache and the client won’t need to download it again.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Also, consider the content of the <em class="EmphasisItalic">jquery.min.js</em> file. If you enter the URL for this resource into a web browser to view its contents, you’ll see code similar to Figure 6-2.</p>&#13;
<figure>&#13;
<p class="AnchoredGraphic"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" src="image/CitC06_02_jQueryMinified.png"/></p>&#13;
<figcaption class="Caption">Figure 6-2: jQuery framework minified code snippet</figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="Body">This snippet of JavaScript code is illegible to humans but still accessible to computers. The code is <em class="EmphasisItalic">minified</em>, condensed to make the file size as small as possible so the browser can quickly download it. It’s been stripped of all line breaks and indentations, and intuitive variable and function names are replaced with cryptic identifiers just a few characters long.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">With the coding playground, including frameworks is often as simple as selecting them from a drop-down list without needing to add any code. Other examples of details that are abstracted out when working in code playgrounds instead of locally include the <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">&lt;meta&gt;</span> tags that provide information, such as author, keyword, and site description, to web crawlers. Also, the <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">&lt;doctype&gt;</span> tag that comes before the <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">&lt;html&gt;</span> tag tells the browser what kind of document it’s reading and how to interpret its tags. In addition, the <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">?v=0.1</span> is appended to the filenames: it will be incremented to <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">?v=0.2</span> and so forth as the files are updated, to let client browsers know to refresh the cached versions of these files with the latest one. You can discuss endless little details and changing best practices in class to give your students the best understanding of why certain elements exist and are defined the way they are in the code students work with.</p>&#13;

<h2 class="BoxHead">The World Wide Web and the Internet</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Many people, even technically proficient people, make the mistake of thinking the internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) are the same when in fact they’re two very different technical concepts. The confusion stems from the fact that people take the two terms for granted and use them interchangeably. Understanding how these concepts differ will give your students a deeper understanding of the systems architecture.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">The <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">internet</em> is a network of computers and other devices all over the world; each device has its own <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">internet protocol (IP) address</em> uniquely identifying it on the network. The internet makes sharing information among devices possible. It’s a decentralized network of networks, meaning each computer is independent and no one can own or control the entire network.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Many <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">internet protocols</em> run on the internet define various <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">interfaces </em>for different kinds of data. For example, <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">file transfer protocol (FTP)</em> copies files over the network. <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP)</em> is a standard that sends emails over the internet. <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)</em> enables communication between website servers and web browsers.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">The <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">WWW</em> is the vast collection of linked documents and online applications that are sent from web servers to web clients via HTTP. Web browsers are beginning to hide their protocol portion, but a complete web address might read <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">http://www.example.com/</em>. The “http” portion defines the protocol, and the “www” somewhat redundantly identifies the site as part of the world of linked documents. Combined, HTTP and WWW are just one of many protocols running on the network of networks that is the internet.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">It’s important to note that HTTP and WWW weren’t always the only standard for sharing documents online. The <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">Gopher </em>protocol was an early competitor to WWW. It offered a standard that some considered more efficient and organized than WWW but was also more hierarchical. The Gopher protocol is still used by enthusiasts, and knowledge of some of its history might help students understand how the protocols we take for granted today weren’t inevitable.</p>&#13;

</aside><p class="Body">One aspect of local development we’ll learn in more detail in Chapter 9 is how to collaborate when working in the local file system. We’ll explore tools that allow students to work on their code locally while still collaborating with others. For the immediate future, the projects students work on will be mostly individual exercises of solo problem-solving and class exercises of evaluating code as a group, before moving on to collaborate on larger projects in smaller groups. As the educator, you’ll keep tabs on the best practices in web development and iteratively improve the starting-point code you provide students in code playgrounds and as local files.</p>&#13;
<h2 class="HeadA"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>Summary</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, we explored code playgrounds as an important step toward intentional development and had students work in longer-term, more permanent projects. We learned about the features and functionality of a good code playground, from separating the content, style, and functionality into different development panels to the UI features that make coding easier, features for collaboration and porting code to other platforms, licensing options, and JavaScript frameworks that empower students to make magic. We briefly learned about separating content, styling, and code into different files for local development and the additional details code playgrounds abstract away.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">The power of the web development tools is that they instantly give students existing code to experiment with. The power of code playgrounds is the ability to easily fork existing code to adopt, adapt, and improve into permanent projects. The power of local development is being exposed to all the details the other environments abstract away and seeing the whole picture, just like an application developer working in the field. Each tool levels up the student from playing with existing code and into intentional development.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Once you have an established development environment, either in an online code playground or the local file system in which your students will begin to intentionally extend existing code and begin making their own ideas manifest, we can start exploring some concrete code projects for this environment. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">In the next chapter, we’ll review some exercises to challenge and enlighten your students to build their coding confidence.</p>&#13;

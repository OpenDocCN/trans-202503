<p class="chapterintro">I hope that you’ve enjoyed reading this book half as much as I’ve enjoyed writing it. For me, this project was a new, exciting, and illuminating endeavor. It’s my first, and quite possibly only, book. If you had told me upon high school graduation that I’d someday be an author, I never would’ve believed you.</p>
<p class="tx">I was a math kid, and I also excelled at a BASIC coding course that was offered my senior year. I did well enough in English, but I then considered writing to be a chore. In college, I enjoyed two technical writing courses as part of my major, but the idea of a book still would’ve seemed absurd. After many years of reading different types of books and articles, I slowly began to appreciate the creative outlet that is writing. I dabbled here and there but never published anything, not even a blog. Sometime around my 50th birthday and after years of coding bat files, the hint of an inkling of an idea for writing this book took shallow root, but I wasn’t yet ready to act upon this most bizarre midlife crisis, if that’s what it was.</p>
<p class="tx"><span aria-label=" Page 424. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_424" role="doc-pagebreak"/>More than two years later, in May 2020, two events collided that left me with some spare time allowing me to put fingertips to keyboard. (By this point in the computer age, we should have a better digital euphemism for “put pen to paper.”) First, the realization that the coronavirus pandemic would last more than a couple of months became glaringly obvious. I had plenty of vacation time and no travel plans. Second, after a decade and a half of intense parenting, including the coaching of several youth sports teams, my son reached an age where instead of demanding my time, he demanded the exact opposite (like most teenagers).</p>
<p class="tx">My wife and I (while sometimes dragging our son along) did a fair amount of hiking that summer. I also did a lot of running, but I returned to the idea of this book, especially with the knowledge that normality wouldn’t be returning before temperatures dropped in the Northeast. Sporadically and in no particular order, I wrote a chapter here and there, not knowing if I’d post them on a blog or find some other medium, but before long I knew that I wanted to write a book, an actual physical book. As the mercury dropped, I wrote every weekend, and this continued through to the spring and summer ... and the next fall, and beyond. (I code fast but write slow.) My wife to me in early June 2021: “So what do you want for Father’s Day, other than to be left alone so that you can write?”</p>
<p class="tx">After a couple of years, I presented what I thought was a finished product to No Starch Press. To my amazement, my publisher of first choice signed me up. Being a novice, my manuscript was raw, and they had some great ideas about how I could organize and improve what I had without losing my voice. (As for my voice, I write first for myself and then consider possible critiques. Who would write “the hint of an inkling of an idea?” Is it pretentious or just inane? I don’t know, but I like it and can only hope you do too.)</p>
<p class="tx">More than 90 percent of what’s in this book represents the type of coding and techniques that I’ve used often personally and professionally. As for the small amount of material that I had to research, I hope that I’ve blended it seamlessly (and indistinguishably) with what’s in my wheelhouse.</p>
<p class="tx">For most coding languages, the idea of a single book covering the majority of the language’s functionality would be ludicrous. For instance, there are introductory Python books, others for Python and web development, and yet others for Python and databases, just to name a few. But Batch scripting is a more manageable subject. I hope that I’ve included most of the important features about the language for beginners and experts alike, but no book can be truly comprehensive.</p>
<p class="tx">Many commands haven’t made it into these pages. For instance, the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">curl</span> command transfers data from and to a server, <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">cipher</span> encrypts and decrypts files, and <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">runas</span> runs a bat file under a different user profile. There are other commands specific to system administration that I haven’t covered, and I’ve left others out because I simply don’t find them useful. I haven’t mentioned the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">replace</span> command (until now) because Batch has much better tools available for replacing one file with another.</p>
<p class="tx">For those remaining pieces of Batch that I haven’t covered, I hope you now have the tools to perform your own research. More than once, I’ve <span aria-label=" Page 425. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_425" role="doc-pagebreak"/>mentioned that you can find a full list of commands including a description, syntax, options, and examples at <i class="calibre6"><a href="https://ss64.com/nt/" class="calibre3">https://<wbr/>ss64<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/nt<wbr/>/</a></i>. You can scroll through the list of commands looking for something that might be useful for a particular problem or if you’ve heard of a certain command for configuring internet protocols and want to learn more, just click on <b class="calibre10">ipconfig</b> and explore. No book is going to have everything, but I hope that you’ve found this one to contain the essentials, and much more.</p>
<p class="tx">For the coders finishing this book, the next time you’re working on a simple bat file that needs something a little out of the ordinary—arrays, booleans, floating-point arithmetic, stacks, maybe even an object—I hope that you don’t immediately fall back on writing some compiled code. Depending on the situation, a few lines of Batch might be the most efficient solution.</p>
<p class="tx">For the noncoders, if you made it all the way through <span class="xref"><a href="part3.xhtml" class="calibre3">Part III</a></span>, consider yourself an honorary coder. But more to the point, the next time you have a redundant task that must be done at certain intervals, perhaps daily, consider Batch. Run a simple bat file at the end of the day to copy your day’s work to a backup server or a shared directory. If a few reports need to be merged into a single file, don’t cut and paste. Impress your boss and co-workers, and maybe even yourself.</p>
<p class="tx">Along these lines, I have one last bat file to share. As I was writing this book, I obviously backed up to the cloud, but I also wanted a date-stamped folder of the current state of all Word documents, bat files, and anything else associated with this book, and I wanted to make this backup at the end of each day of writing. Just before logging off, I would plug a thumb drive into my laptop and run a bat file containing just this code from my desktop:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">set @=%date%
xcopy C:\Batch\*.* D:\Batch\%@:~10,4%%@:~4,2%%@:~7,2%\ /F /S /Y
pause
</code></pre>
<p class="tni">This quick and dirty bat file builds a datestamp for the target folder name under <i class="calibre6">D:\Batch\</i>. The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">xcopy</span> command creates my backup from <i class="calibre6">C:\Batch\</i>, and the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">pause</span> command holds the window open so that I’ll know if I’ve run out of disk space. This was an incredibly simple solution that fit my needs, but you can expand on this to build a more robust bat file.</p>
<p class="tx">I consider myself a scripting evangelist, in general, and a Batch evangelist, in particular. Coders too often fall back on compiled code for tasks more easily and efficiently performed with a script. In <span class="xref"><a href="chapter1.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 1</a></span>, I defined the word <i class="calibre6">batphile</i> as a “lover of nocturnal flying mammals.” I’d now like to assign to it a secondary definition, “lover of bat files.” (Batfilephile is painfully clunky.) I hope that if you weren’t already, you’re now a proud batphile—in at least one sense of the word. Some fear the flying mammals, but they’re fascinating animals and rather adorable.</p>

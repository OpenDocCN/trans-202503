Are you without a nice project and\njust dying to cut your teeth on a OS you can try to modify for your\nneeds? Are you finding it frustrating when everything works on minix?\nNo more allnighters to get a nifty program working? Then this post\nmight be just for you :-)\n...\nI can (well, almost) hear you asking yourselves \"why?\". Hurd will be\nout in a year (or two, or next month, who knows), and I've already got\nminix. This is a program for hackers by a hacker. I've enjouyed doing\nit, and somebody might enjoy looking at it and even modifying it for\ntheir own needs. It is still small enough to understand, use and\nmodify, and I'm looking forward to any comments you might have. I'm\nalso interested in hearing from anybody who has written any of the\nutilities/library functions for minix. If your efforts are freely\ndistributable (under copyright or even public domain), I'd like to\nhear from you, so I can add them to the system.\n...\nDrop me a line if you are willing to let me use your code.\nLinus\n```", "```\n$ sudo losetup --find --read-only --partscan --show image.raw\n/dev/loop0\n$ ls /dev/loop0* \n/dev/loop0 /dev/loop0p1 /dev/loop0p2\n```", "```\n$ sudo fdisk -l /dev/loop0\nDisk /dev/loop0: 20 GiB, 21474836480 bytes, 41943040 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisklabel type: dos\nDisk identifier: 0xce7b65de\n\nDevice        Boot     Start       End   Sectors   Size Id Type\n/dev/loop0p1            2048  24188109  24186062  11.5G 83 Linux\n/dev/loop0p2        24188110  41929649  17741540   8.5G 82 Linux swap / Solaris\n```", "```\n$ program < file\n$ program > file\n$ program >> file\n$ program1 | program2\n$ program1 | program2 | program3\n$ program1 < file1 | program2 | program3 > file2\n```"]

<p class="noindent">The key to efficient algorithms is information.” It was Professor Drecker’s mantra, barked at the cadets at the start of every Police Algorithms class, ferociously enough to sear itself permanently into Frank’s memory. “A good algorithm depends on finding the structure in the data and using it. It depends on information.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank smiled to himself at the memory as he turned onto Three Bit Lane, a rutted dirt road lined with a combination of seedy bars and upscale coffee shops. He nodded politely to a pair of passing knights, who clanged as they jittered past in their armor, and made a mental note to grab a Triple-Bold Espresso before he left. First he needed information, something to help guide his search. He knew exactly where to start.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Glass Box Billy would be in one of the establishments by now, sitting quietly and listening to the wisps of conversation drifting through the room. People didn’t mean to say things around Billy; they simply didn’t notice he was there. Billy had been blessed with a single notable talent: utter inconspicuousness. Whatever he tried, there was something about Billy that meant people just didn’t notice him. Maybe it was his pale skin or his small physique; maybe it was <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_10"/>his exceptionally mundane taste in clothing. Whatever it was, Billy had long ago decided to put his one talent to use by eavesdropping, collecting information, and selling it to anyone who would buy.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0010-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank eyed the eight storefronts hunched together in Three Bit Lane and wondered which one Billy would have chosen. He ran through half a dozen search algorithms in his head, but it was pointless. Frank didn’t have any information to go on. Billy could be in any one of the bars or coffee shops.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">He’d have to use an exhaustive search—simply try all the possibilities until he found Billy. It didn’t sit well with him. Years of the detective and private investigation game had taught him that there was almost always a better algorithm than exhaustive search, and he hated resorting to something so inefficient.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Grumbling, Frank started his search. He walked into the first bar on the street, The Absolute Value.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_11"/><img src="../images/f0011-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The bartender, a surly man named Abe, glared at Frank as he entered and pointedly dropped his hand below the scarred counter. The message was clear: “I am now holding a weapon. I’ll let you guess what kind. But if you hassle me, I’ll give you a very close look.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I don’t want any trouble, Abe,” said Frank, holding up his hands. “I’m just here to see Billy.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Well, Billy ain’t here,” said the barman.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank almost smiled in relief. “Then I’ll be on my way,” he said.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Abe gave a curt nod and watched Frank leave, his hand still under the counter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank took a couple of deep breaths and shook his head in the cool air. Abe held a grudge longer than anyone else Frank had ever met. Then again, Frank had arrested four of his siblings.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The next establishment on the street was The Brazen Boolean, a modern coffee shop decorated in typical Boolean style—stark black and white. The inhabitants of the City of Bool were renowned for their fanatic devotion to the absolute concepts of logic, viewing everything as either True or False. They made good witnesses. As the only Boolean café in town, The Brazen Boolean was a haven for expats. After all, either you were a Boolean or you weren’t.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0011-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank popped his head in the door and asked everyone in general, “Is Billy here?” There was a brief silence as twenty pairs of eyes carefully scanned every inch of the cafe. Booleans wouldn’t answer a question until they were absolutely sure.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_12"/>“No,” came the precise reply.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank continued his exhaustive search.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0012-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The third and fourth shops proved equally fruitless, although significantly more pleasant. The bartender of the Constant Const greeted Frank warmly and invited him in to reminisce about the good old days together, which was odd considering Frank had only met him the month before. And the crowd of the Daring Double, a notoriously loud wizards’ hangout, cheered at each new arrival and sang happily over their steaming mugs.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0012-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank found Billy in the fifth shop, the Exponentiated Expresso. It was by far the loudest and tackiest coffee shop on the street, but it managed to draw the most devoted following on account of its triply caffeinated beans. On a good day, every table would be packed with jittery people who seemed to think the key to a good conversation was volume.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0012-03.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_13"/>This morning, the Exponentiated Expresso hosted a comparatively subdued crowd. Only a handful of tables were occupied, and most of those by lone coffee drinkers who shook and mumbled quietly to themselves.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Billy sat at a central table, leaning awkwardly toward a nearby conversation. Nobody seemed to notice him. Frank had even missed him on his first scan of the room.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Billy!” Frank called.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Billy jumped up guiltily. “Frank?” He grinned, happy that someone had acknowledged him, and sat back down. “Pull up a chair.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I’m looking for some information,” explained Frank as he took a seat across from Billy.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Could be that I have some,” said Billy. “I have such a hard time remembering these days,” he said, glancing toward a long-empty mug that probably wasn’t his.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank signaled the barista, who soon placed a fresh mug on the table. “Remember anything about a theft at the police station?” Frank asked Billy.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Billy’s eyes widened and he flinched. “A robbery, you say?” he asked unconvincingly. His eyes darted around the room, but, as always, nobody paid him any attention.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank laid two gold pieces on the table, ignoring the sour feeling in his gut. He couldn’t afford to spend this type of money, especially without knowing if he was paying for a lead or idle gossip. But he’d known this wasn’t going to be cheap. He leaned in close. “Two nights ago,” he said quietly, “the thieves took a whole pile of documents.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Doesn’t sound like the sort of thing that would be healthy to remember,” said Billy. He eyed the gold pieces. “Afraid you’re asking the wrong guy, Frank.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“That’s gold,” Frank growled.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Sorry. I can’t help you,” Billy said. He surveyed the room again before adding, “Even if I did know something about a robbery, it’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_14"/>the sort of thing I would try to forget. Even if I did know something small, like who might have helped with logistics, it’s not worth the risk of waking up to find my shoes packed with yak dung.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank stared, but Billy had gone silent. For someone who made a living sharing information, Billy had an odd habit of not saying things.“Yak dung?” asked Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Billy nodded, but didn’t offer any more.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“You couldn’t be more specific, could you?” asked Frank. “Are we talking about Northern or Southern yaks?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Does it matter?” asked Billy. “The point is that if I knew anything about who arranged transportation, I wouldn’t remember it. Especially not if those people happened to have a large farm about five miles out of town where they could easily make someone disappear. And very doubly especially if the family that owns the farm has a history of illegal activity and an unhealthy sense of humor. Nope. It definitely wouldn’t be healthy to remember anything in that case.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Too bad,” Frank said with a smile. “Maybe next time then.” He nodded toward the coins. “Incentive to remember things in the future.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">With that, Frank stood and strode from the Exponentiated Expresso. He turned left and continued up the street. Once off Three Bit Lane, he could swing around and make for Crannock’s farm—the only farm remotely matching Billy’s description.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As he passed the Faulty Register, he noticed a shadow dart into a nearby alley. He cursed under his breath, but kept going. Of course he had a tail already; the captain hadn’t exactly been discreet about his visit.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But by the time he left the city and was on the rough dirt lane to Crannock’s farm, he found himself in a good mood. Billy hadn’t given him much, but even a little information could mean the difference between an efficient search algorithm and an exhaustive one.</p>&#13;

<p class="sbsub"><em><strong>Excerpt from Professor Drecker’s Lecture</strong></em></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">An exhaustive search algorithm searches every possibility in the entire search space for the target value. The most common exhaustive search is a <em>linear search</em>, which simply checks all the different possibilities in order.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Consider what happens when you chase a robber into the second-floor hallway of an abandoned hotel. The hall has 30 doors, all of them closed. If you’ve followed correct police procedures, your partner has already blocked off the opposite staircase, and the robber is trapped somewhere on that floor. How do you find him? Do you pick random doors, running back and forth until you get lucky? No! You search down the hall, kicking in one door at a time.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Or consider an algorithm that scans a list of numbers (an <em>array</em>), searching for a target value. The algorithm moves along the list from number to number, checking each value in turn so as not to miss any, and stops when it reaches the target. If we are searching an array for the number 5, then the search would progress as follows:</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0015-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_16"/>The advantage of linear search algorithms is that they are simple to implement in the field and they work even on unstructured data. You don’t have to make any assumptions about which room the robber chose; you just check everything. The downside is that exhaustive algorithms are often not the most efficient algorithm if the data has structure that can be used. If you know where the robber went, you can save yourself from kicking a lot of doors by using that information.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The key to efficient algorithms is information!</p>&#13;

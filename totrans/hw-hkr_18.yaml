    I’ve often wondered why the “I am not a lawyer” disclaimer is necessary. It was
    explained to me that even the appearance of dispensing legal advice without the
    disclaimer can make me guilty of practicing law without a proper license. I could
    also be held accountable for bad decisions made by people who construe the opinions
    as legal advice.[*](ch04.xhtml#fn_8) Specifically, Apache 2.0, section 3 reads,
    “Grant of Patent License. ... If You institute patent litigation against any entity
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
    patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
    for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.”[†](ch04.xhtml#fn_9)

    it has notions of followers, likes/dislikes, karma, and moderators. Guanxi predates
    the modern legal system and can be more effective than the civil code for resolving
    or avoiding all manners of disputes. Guanxi is also essential in facilitating
    new deals and relationships.'

<h2 class="h2" id="ch00"><a id="page_xv"/><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<div class="image1"><img alt="image" src="graphics/common-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="noindent">Science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke wrote that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” If we don’t know how something works, then it might as well be explained by supernatural forces. By that standard, we live in an age of magic.</p>
<p class="indent">Software is woven into our lives, into everyday things like online transactions, special effects in movies, and streaming video. We’re forgetting we used to live in a world in which the answer to a question wasn’t just a Google search away, or where finding a route for a car trip began with unfolding a cumbersome map.</p>
<p class="indent">But few of us have any idea how all this software works. Unlike many innovations of the past, you can’t take software apart to see what it’s doing. Everything happens on a computer chip that looks the same whether the device is performing an amazing task or isn’t even turned on. Knowing how <a id="page_xvi"/>a program works seems to require spending years of study to become a programmer. So it’s no wonder that many of us assume that software is beyond our understanding, a collection of secrets known only to a technological elite. But that’s wrong.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec01"><strong>Who This Book Is For</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Anyone can learn how software works. All you need is curiosity. Whether you’re a casual fan of technology, a programmer in the making, or someone in between, this book is for you.</p>
<p class="indent">This book covers the most commonly used processes in software and does so without a single line of programming code. No prior knowledge of how computers operate is required. To make this possible, I’ve simplified a few processes and clipped some details, but that doesn’t mean these are mere high-level overviews; you’ll be getting the real goods, with enough details that you’ll truly understand how these programs do what they do.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec02"><strong>Topics Covered</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentb">Computers are so ubiquitous in the modern world that the list of subjects I could cover seems endless. I’ve chosen topics that are most central to our daily lives and with the most interesting explanations.</p>
<p class="bull">• <strong><a href="ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1: <em>Encryption</em></a></strong> allows us to scramble our data so that only we can access it. When you lock your phone or password-protect a <em>.zip</em> file, you’re using encryption. We’ll see how different scrambling techniques are combined in modern encryption software.</p>
<p class="bull">• <strong><a href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2: <em>Passwords</em></a></strong> are the keys we use to lock our data and how we identify ourselves to remote systems. You’ll see how passwords are used in encryption and learn the surprising steps that must be taken to keep passwords safe from attackers.</p>
<p class="bull">• <strong><a href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3: <em>Web Security</em></a></strong> is what we need to safely purchase goods online or access our accounts. Locking data for transmission requires a different method of scrambling called public-key encryption. You’ll discover how a secure web session requires all the techniques covered in the first three chapters.</p>
<p class="bull">• <strong><a href="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4: <em>Movie CGI</em></a></strong> is pure software magic, creating whole worlds out of mathematical descriptions. You’ll discover how software took over traditional cel animation and then learn the key concepts behind making a complete movie set with software.</p>
<p class="bull">• <strong><a href="ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5: <em>Game Graphics</em></a></strong> are impressive not just for their visuals but also for how they are created in mere fractions of a second. We’ll explore a host of clever tricks games use to produce stunning images when they don’t have time for the techniques discussed in the previous chapter.</p>
<p class="bull"><a id="page_xvii"/>• <strong><a href="ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6: <em>Data Compression</em></a></strong> shrinks data so that we can get more out of our storage and bandwidth limits. We’ll explore the best methods for shrinking data, and then see how they are combined to compress high-definition video for Blu-ray discs and web streams.</p>
<p class="bull">• <strong><a href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7: <em>Search</em></a></strong> is about finding data instantly, whether it’s a search for a file on our own computer or a search across the whole Web. We’ll explore how data is organized for quick searches, how search zeros in on requested data, and how web searches return the most useful results.</p>
<p class="bull">• <strong><a href="ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8: <em>Concurrency</em></a></strong> allows multiple programs to share data. Without concurrency, multiplayer video games wouldn’t be possible, and online bank systems could allow only one customer at a time. We’ll talk about the methods that enable different processors to access the same data without getting in each other’s way.</p>
<p class="bull">• <strong><a href="ch09.html#ch09">Chapter 9: <em>Map Routes</em></a></strong> are those instant directions we get from mapping sites and in-car navigators. You’ll discover what a map looks like to software and the specialized search techniques that find the best routes.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec03"><strong>Behind the Magic</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">I think it’s important to share this knowledge. We shouldn’t have to live in a world we don’t understand, and it’s becoming impossible to understand the modern world without also understanding software. Clarke’s message can be taken as a warning that those who understand technology can fool those who don’t. For example, a company may claim that the theft of its login data poses little danger to its customers. Could this be true, and how? After reading this book, you’ll know the answer to questions like these.</p>
<p class="indent">Beyond that, though, there’s an even better reason to learn the secrets of how software works: because those secrets are <em>really cool</em>. I think the best magic tricks are even more magical once you learn how they are done. Read on and you’ll see what I mean.<a id="page_xviii"/></p>

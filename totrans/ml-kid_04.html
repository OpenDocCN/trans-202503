<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="OpenerCap"><img src="Images/Alphabet-I.png" alt="Alphabet-I" class="dropcap"/></span>n the last few chapters, you’ve been training a computer to recognize images. There are lots of useful jobs that computers can help us do if they know how to see. One such job, <em>optical character recognition</em><em/><em/><em> (OCR)</em>, is when a computer is able to recognize a picture of a letter or number after it has seen lots of examples of that character. </p>
<p class="ChapterIntroContinued">A computer trained to do OCR can read the printed words in newspapers and books. </p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="68" id="Page_68"/>When combined with a text-to-speech system that can read the recognized words out loud, OCR is used to help visually impaired people read text that they might not be able to see for themselves.  </p>
<p>Historians, librarians, and archivists use OCR to study historical books and printed documents. ML makes it possible to search through publications going back hundreds of years, because OCR can recognize the words.</p>
<p>On our roads, OCR systems recognize letters and numbers on license plates. <em>Automatic number plate recognition</em><em> (ANPR) </em>is used to keep traffic flowing by enabling fast and efficient tolls and to improve road safety by recognizing when a car is driving too fast as it passes a checkpoint.</p>
<p>Businesses use OCR to help process forms and documents. If you fill in a form or write a check, an ML system will often use OCR to automatically recognize what you’ve written. </p>
<p>If you’ve traveled abroad, you may have used translation apps. You can point a smartphone at a sign or menu in a foreign language and have the phone translate that into your own language. OCR is used to recognize the words and letters in the picture. </p>
<p>One common use of OCR is to help sort mail, which is what we’ll do in this chapter. You’ll train a computer to recognize handwriting and see how OCR can be used to quickly sort letters. You’ll create a mail sorting office in Scratch that can automatically sort letters by recognizing the postcode written on the envelope (see <a id="figureanchor6-1" href="#figure6-1">Figure 6-1</a>).</p>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>

<h2 id="h1-500563c06-0001"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="69" id="Page_69"/>Build Your Project</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">First, choose three big cities that you want your sorting office to be able to recognize letters for.</p>
<p>For my screenshots, I chose three cities in the UK: Edinburgh, Oxford, and Southampton. </p>
<p>Next, you need to choose some codes that can be used to identify those cities. In the UK, where I live, these are called <em>postcodes</em>. (In the United States, they’re known as ZIP codes.) To make this project quicker, I used the first couple of letters of each postcode.</p>
<p>For my project, I used:</p>
<ul>
<li>EH as the postcode for Edinburgh addresses</li>
<li>OX as the postcode for Oxford addresses</li>
<li>SO as the postcode for Southampton addresses</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re in the United States, instead of the ZIP code, you can use the postal abbreviation for the state where your cities are located. For example, you could use TX to represent Dallas addresses, or MA to represent Boston addresses. </p>
<p>Choose <em>three</em> cities with <em>three different short codes</em> to represent them. </p>
<h3 id="h2-500563c06-0001">Train Your Model</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">To train the computer to recognize the postcodes you’ve chosen, you’ll draw examples of those codes and use them to train an ML model. </p>

<p class="BodyFirst">You’ve trained an ML model to recognize handwriting on an envelope, and you’ve created a project in Scratch that uses OCR to automatically sort letters!</p>
<p>How could you improve your project?</p>
<p>Try getting someone else to test your project. Can it recognize their handwriting? If the model makes a lot of mistakes with their handwriting, ask them to add some examples to your training buckets in the Train phase. (Make sure that you train a new ML model in the Learn &amp; Test phase so that the computer can learn from both of your examples.)</p>
<p>The wider the variety of examples you use to train the computer, the better the ML model should be at recognizing different handwriting styles.</p>
<p>What else could you do to improve your project?</p>
<h2 id="h1-500563c06-0003">What You Learned</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Sorting mail is a common use of <em>optical character recognition</em><em/><em/>. Large sorting offices around the world use OCR systems to recognize and sort letters in a fraction of a second. Your project just recognized a postcode, but real-world multiline optical character readers can recognize several lines of an address. The basic idea is very similar, and it helps make large-scale mail sorting efficient and practical.</p>
<p>All of your projects so far have used images, but computers can be trained to recognize many different types of data. In the next chapter, you’ll train an ML model to recognize text!</p>

And like many programmers, I was probably surprised and seduced by the simplicity of <code class="literal">make</code>’s syntax without realizing the hidden depths and power of this universal program.</p><p>After many years of working with a variety of real makefiles, blogging about my findings, and answering GNU <code class="literal">make</code> questions from my blog readers, I gained real-world insights and a deep appreciation for GNU <code class="literal">make</code>. Many of these insights came from founding a company called Electric Cloud, where one of my projects was to completely replicate the functionality of GNU <code class="literal">make</code>. To do so, I absorbed the GNU <code class="literal">make</code> manual; wrote countless test makefiles to ensure that my “GNU <code class="literal">make</code>,” written in C++, worked like the real program; and spent hours testing my version against enormous real-world makefiles supplied by our customers.</p><p>From my experiences with GNU <code class="literal">make</code> came my desire to write a book to share tips, warnings, solutions, and further possibilities, big and small, that would help programmers get the most out of this sometimes difficult but ultimately indispensable program. The core <code class="literal">make</code> syntax results in makefiles that are terse and understandable (at least small parts are) but can be difficult to maintain. On the bright side, <code class="literal">make</code> provides just enough functionality for software builds without including too many extra features. Many <code class="literal">make</code> replacements have found niches but have failed to displace GNU <code class="literal">make</code> (and other similar <code class="literal">make</code> programs).</p><p>I hope this book will be a practical source of help for those of you who wrangle makefiles daily or for anyone who has wondered, “Now, how do I do <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> using <code class="literal">make</code>?” If you’re new to GNU <code class="literal">make</code>, I recommend that you start with <a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. The Basics Revisited">Chapter 1</a> and work your way through the book. Otherwise, feel free to skip around. In any case, I hope you will find ideas to help you spend less time debugging makefiles and more time running fast builds.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="pref03note01"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Because GNU <code class="literal">make</code> is sensitive about different types of whitespace, whenever a tab character is needed I’ve used</em></span> → <span class="emphasis"><em>for clarity.</em></span></p></div><p>I’d particularly like to thank the following people who encouraged me in my makefile hacking and GNU <code class="literal">make</code> programming: Mike Maciag, Eric Melski, Usman Muzaffar (who pops up in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Pitfalls and Problems">Chapter 4</a>), John Ousterhout, and the maintainer of GNU <code class="literal">make</code>, Paul Smith. Finally, I’m very grateful to the team at No Starch Press who jumped at the idea of publishing a book about GNU <code class="literal">make</code> when I emailed them out of the blue; they have been a great team to work with.</p></div></body></html>

    and a black leather jacket pulled up on a red motorcycle. On the back of the bike
    was a huge bag full of packages and envelopes.

    somewhere.” He rummaged around in his bag and handed Laurie a plain envelope.
    When she opened it, all she found inside was the strangest nonsense:'

    Let’s see what we’ve got here.” Xor crawled onto the message for a closer look.
    The paper was white, so of course his skin turned black.

    said Xor.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Kings always want something silly, like a book about everything or a chariot
    with no weak parts,” he said. “This king decided that he wanted a perfect map
    as large as his kingdom. That way, the royal cartographers could fit *everything*
    in, down to the last pebble and flower. It took seven whole years to finish it.
    But it was a disaster!”

    you had to travel exactly that distance,” the lizard explained. “By that time
    you were already there.”

    to put the map except right where it was. It was a huge bother, what with the
    map sitting on top of people’s houses, and none of the crops could grow. The people
    finally overthrew the king and tore up the map. They say you can still see huge
    pieces of paper blowing around in the desert.”

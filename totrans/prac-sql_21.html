<p class="ChapterIntro">This appendix contains resources to help you stay informed about PostgreSQL developments, find additional software, and get help. Because software resources are likely to change, I’ll maintain a copy of this appendix at the GitHub repository that contains all the book’s resources. You can find a link to GitHub via <a href="https://nostarch.com/practical-sql-2nd-edition/" class="LinkURL">https://nostarch.com/practical-sql-2nd-edition/</a>.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065b01-0001">PostgreSQL Development Environments</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Throughout the book, we’ve used the graphical user interface pgAdmin to connect to PostgreSQL, run queries, and view database objects. Although pgAdmin is free, open source, and popular, it’s not your only choice for working with PostgreSQL. The wiki entry “PostgreSQL Clients” at <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_Clients" class="LinkURL">https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_Clients</a> catalogs many alternatives.</p>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="408" id="Page_408"/>The following list shows several tools I’ve tried, including free and paid options. The free tools work well for general analysis work. If you wade deeper into database development, you might want to upgrade to the paid options, which typically offer advanced features and support.</p>&#13;
<ol class="none">&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Beekeeper Studio</span>  Free and open source GUI for PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, and other platforms. Beekeeper works on Windows, macOS, and Linux and features one of the more refined app designs among database GUIs (see <a href="https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/" class="LinkURL">https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/</a>).</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">DBeaver</span>  Described as a “universal database tool” that works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and many other databases, DBeaver includes a visual query builder, code autocompletion, and other advanced features. There are paid and free versions for Windows, macOS, and Linux (see <a href="https://dbeaver.com/" class="LinkURL">https://dbeaver.com/</a>).</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">DataGrip</span>  A SQL development environment that offers code completion, bug detection, and suggestions for streamlining code, among many other features. It’s a paid product, but the company, JetBrains, offers discounts and free versions for students, educators, and nonprofits (see <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/" class="LinkURL">https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/</a>).</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Navicat</span>  A richly featured SQL development environment with versions that support PostgreSQL as well as other databases, including MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, and Microsoft SQL Server. There is no free version of Navicat, but the company offers a 14-day free trial (see <a href="https://www.navicat.com/" class="LinkURL">https://www.navicat.com/</a>).</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Postbird</span>  A simple cross-platform PostgreSQL GUI for writing queries and viewing objects. Free and open source (see <a href="https://github.com/Paxa/postbird/" class="LinkURL">https://github.com/Paxa/postbird/</a>).</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Postico</span>  A macOS-only client from the maker of Postgres.app that takes its cues from Apple design. The full version is paid, but a restricted-feature version is available with no time limit (see <a href="https://eggerapps.at/postico/" class="LinkURL">https://eggerapps.at/postico/</a>).</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p>A trial version can help you decide whether the product is right for you.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065b01-0002">PostgreSQL Utilities, Tools, and Extensions</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">You can expand the capabilities of PostgreSQL via numerous third-party utilities, tools, and extensions. These range from additional backup and import/export options to improved formatting for the command line to powerful statistics packages. You’ll find a curated list online at <a href="https://github.com/dhamaniasad/awesome-postgres/" class="LinkURL">https://github.com/dhamaniasad/awesome-postgres/</a>, but here are several to highlight:</p>&#13;
<ol class="none">&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Devart Excel Add-in for PostgreSQL</span>  An Excel add-in that lets you load and edit data from PostgreSQL directly in Excel workbooks (see <a href="https://www.devart.com/excel-addins/postgresql.html" class="LinkURL">https://www.devart.com/excel-addins/postgresql.html</a>).</li>&#13;

</ol>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065b01-0003">PostgreSQL News and Community</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Now that you’re a bona fide PostgreSQL user, it’s wise to stay on top of community news. The PostgreSQL development team updates the software on a regular basis, and changes might affect code you’ve written or tools you’re using. You might even find new opportunities for analysis.</p>&#13;
<p>Here’s a collection of online resources to help you stay informed:</p>&#13;
<ol class="none">&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Crunchy Data blog</span>  Posts from the team at Crunchy Data, which provides enterprise PostgreSQL support and solutions (see <a href="https://blog.crunchydata.com/blog/" class="LinkURL">https://blog.crunchydata.com/blog/</a>).</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead"><b>The EDB Blog</b></span>  Posts from the team at EDB, a PostgreSQL services company that provides the Windows installer referenced in this book and also leads development of pgAdmin (see <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/" class="LinkURL">https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/</a>).</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead"><b>Planet PostgreSQL</b></span>  Aggregates blog posts and announcements from the database community (see <a href="https://planet.postgresql.org/" class="LinkURL">https://planet.postgresql.org/</a>).</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Postgres Weekly</span>  An email newsletter that rounds up announcements, blog posts, and product announcements (see <a href="https://postgresweekly.com/" class="LinkURL">https://postgresweekly.com/</a>).</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">PostgreSQL mailing lists</span>  These lists are useful for asking questions of community experts. The pgsql-novice and pgsql-general lists are particularly good for beginners, although note that email volume can be heavy (see <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/list/" class="LinkURL">https://www.postgresql.org/list/</a>).</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead"><b>PostgreSQL news archive</b></span>  Official news from the PostgreSQL team (see <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/newsarchive/" class="LinkURL">https://www.postgresql.org/about/newsarchive/</a>).</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">PostgreSQL nonprofits</span>  PostgreSQL-related charitable organizations include the United States PostgreSQL Association and PostgreSQL Europe. Both provide education, events, and advocacy around the product (see <a href="https://postgresql.us/" class="LinkURL">https://postgresql.us/</a><em> </em>and<em> </em><a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/" class="LinkURL">https://www.postgresql.eu/</a>).</li>&#13;
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="410" id="Page_410"/><span class="RunInHead">PostgreSQL user groups</span>  A list of community groups that offer meetups and other activities (see <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/community/user-groups/" class="LinkURL">https://www.postgresql.org/community/user-groups/</a>).</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">PostGIS blog</span>  Announcements and updates about the PostGIS extension (see <a href="https://postgis.net/blog/" class="LinkURL">https://postgis.net/blog/</a>).</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p>Additionally, I recommend paying attention to developer notes for any of the PostgreSQL-related software you use, such as pgAdmin.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065b01-0004">Documentation</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Throughout this book, I’ve made frequent reference to pages in the official PostgreSQL documentation. You can find documentation for each version of the software along with an FAQ and wiki on the main page at <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/" class="LinkURL">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/</a>. It’s worth reading sections of the manual as you learn more about a topic, such as indexes, or search for all the options that come with functions. In particular, the “Preface,” “Tutorial,” and “SQL Language” sections cover much of the material presented in the book’s chapters.</p>&#13;
<p>Other good resources for documentation are the Postgres Guide at <a href="http://postgresguide.com/" class="LinkURL">http://postgresguide.com/</a> and Stack Overflow, where you can find questions and answers posted by developers at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/postgresql/" class="LinkURL">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/postgresql/</a>. You can also check out the Q&amp;A site for PostGIS at <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/postgis/" class="LinkURL">https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/postgis/</a>.</p>&#13;

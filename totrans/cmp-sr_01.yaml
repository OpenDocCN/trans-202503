    is a *desktop*, which sits on or under your desk and isn’t portable. The smallest
    computer you’ll find is a *tablet*, which you can carry around with you everywhere.
    A *laptop* is somewhere in between. Deciding between a desktop, a laptop, and
    a tablet is the first important choice to make when buying a new computer. Let’s
    take a look at each of these.

    of a *tower*, which does all the actual work of the computer, and a *monitor*,
    which is the screen you look at. Desktops have large screens, which is great if
    you need items on the screen to look bigger.

    usually just stay at a desk in your home and aren’t intended to be portable. This
    means you won’t be able to take your desktop with you on vacation! They also take
    up more space than other types of computers, which can be a downside if you live
    in a small apartment.

    lap, which is wonderful if you like the idea of using your computer while lounging
    in your favorite chair. Most laptops weigh only a few pounds, so you can easily
    move them from room to room, work on them at the dining table or in front of the
    TV, or even take them with you on vacation. The battery should last for a few
    hours while the laptop is not plugged in, so you can use it on the go.

    is smaller than that of a desktop, and a laptop is often a little less powerful
    than a desktop of the same price. We’ll look at what makes a computer powerful
    a little later.

    computer is built into the small screen. They’re great for carrying around with
    you and are easy to use on the train, on vacation, or at a coffee shop. Tablets
    don’t come with a keyboard, so you’ll need to tap the screen to type anything.
    This can be a bit awkward, so many tablet users buy separate keyboards, but they’re
    clunky and detract from the portability a bit. Tablets also have much smaller
    screens and relatively little space for storing photos, music, and other files.
    They tend to be more expensive than desktops or laptops of comparable power or
    storage space.

    the faster and more responsive your computer will be. When we say a computer is
    powerful, we’re saying that it has a lot of *processing power*. Some common processors
    are the Intel Pentium, Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7\. An Intel Pentium or Core
    i3 will be fine for most computer tasks, like sending emails and browsing the
    internet, but a Core i5 or Core i7 will perform better, making your computer run
    faster and feel more responsive. If you’re unsure, a Core i3 or Core i5 is usually
    a safe bet!

    a person trying to remember lots of different numbers, names, and tasks at the
    same time, your computer can become slow if it’s trying to juggle too many tasks
    at once—the more RAM it has, the more tasks it can do simultaneously.'

    things open on your computer at one time.

    computer to use again, including letters, photos, videos, songs, and programs,
    is stored on the hard drive. The bigger the hard drive, the more you can store
    on your computer! Like RAM, hard drives are also measured in gigabytes. However,
    because hard drives can be a lot larger than RAM, you might also see them advertised
    in *terabytes (TB)*, where 1 terabyte is equal to 1000 gigabytes.

    that’s 60GB or larger will be perfectly fine. If you’re a movie or music buff
    and plan to keep a collection on your computer, look for a hard drive with at
    least 500GB. Generally, 1GB of hard drive space stores around an hour of home
    video or around 200 photos or songs, but remember that you’ll also need room for
    your apps, emails, and Windows itself! You can expect these to use up at least
    40GB of your hard drive.

    desktops and many laptops come with a DVD drive, but tablets don’t. The one downside
    about a DVD drive in a laptop is that it makes the laptop heavier and thicker,
    so it’s more difficult to take it around with you. Nonetheless, if you think you’re
    likely to need a DVD drive, make sure the computer you buy has one.

    so it’s a good idea to make sure that you get one that’s big enough to read comfortably.
    Keep in mind, though, that the bigger the screen, the bulkier and less portable
    the computer will be. Screen sizes are measured diagonally in inches, just like
    TV screens. Most desktops have screens between 20" and 27". Most laptops are between
    11" and 18", while most tablets are between 7" and 13". If you want to take your
    laptop on frequent trips, a 13" screen is ideal. If you don’t mind leaving your
    computer at home and want to avoid straining your eyes, you should find a 20"
    to 24" screen very comfortable.

- en: Before you set up your computer, it’s worth looking at a few keyboard skills,
    too. As you’ll see in the lessons, pressing a letter or number key on the keyboard
    places that letter or number on the screen wherever the cursor ( ) is located.
    The following diagram outlines some of the important parts of the keyboard that
    you’ll need to know.

<h2 class="h2a">MAKING CHOICES</h2>
<div class="image1"><img src="Image00001.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Now that we’ve covered how to create constants and variables, you’re ready to learn how to tell your computer to make choices. This chapter is about controlling the flow of a computer program by telling the computer which path to take. When we talk about <em>flow</em>
 , we’re referring to the order in which the statements of the program are executed.</p>
<p class="indent">Up to this point, you’ve only seen statements performed in the order you’ve typed them. You’ve done some cool things with this, but by telling the computer how to make choices about the order of executing <span id="page_36"></span>
 statements, you can do even more. To get the computer to make a choice, we’ll use <em>conditional statements</em>
 that tell the computer to run some code based on a condition’s value.</p>
<p class="indent">You already use conditional statements to make choices every day! For example, before you leave home in the morning, you check the weather. If it’s sunny, you may put on a pair of sunglasses. If it’s raining, you grab your umbrella. In each case, you’re checking a condition. If the condition “it is raining” is true, then you take your umbrella when you leave the house. When the condition could be true or false, it’s called a <em>Boolean expression</em>
 . The <span class="code">Bool</span>
 data type that you learned about in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 is used to represent the value <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00076.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec1">
<strong>BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A common type of Boolean expression is one that compares two values using a <em>comparison operator</em>
 . There are six comparison operators. Let’s start with two simple ones: <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec1">
<strong>IS EQUAL AND IS NOT EQUAL</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll use the <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 comparison operators a lot. <em>Is equal</em>
 is written with two equal signs next to each other, like this: <span class="code">==</span>
 . <em>Is not equal</em>
 is written with an exclamation mark and one equal sign, like this: <span class="code">!=</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s try them both out in the playground!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00077.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In plain English, the line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 says, “three plus two equals five,” which is a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement, and the output in the right pane will confirm this as soon as you finish typing it. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the line says, “three is not equal to five,” which is also a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement. Note that <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is an error. Do you know why? While <span class="code">=</span>
 and <span class="code">==</span>
 look a lot alike, remember that a single equal sign (<span class="code">=)</span>
 assigns values. That statement reads, “Put the value of 8 into something called 3 + 5,” which doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="indent">In Swift, the <span class="code">==</span>
 operator also works with other data types, not just numbers. Let’s try making some other comparisons.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_37"></span>
 <img src="Image00078.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is a tricky one; did you expect it to be <span class="code">true</span>
 ? Those two strings are close but not exactly the same, and an <em>is equal</em>
 comparison is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if the two values match exactly. The constant <span class="code">myName</span>
 has a value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 with a capital <em>G</em>
 , which is not the same as <span class="code">"gloria"</span>
 with a lowercase <em>g</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Remember in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 when we said that you can’t use math operators like <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">*</span>
 on things that aren’t the same data type? The same is true for comparisons. You can’t compare things that are different types. The line at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 will cause an error because one is a <span class="code">String</span>
 and the other is a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2">
<strong>GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>

 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />

<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>

 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<h2 class="h2a">MAKING CHOICES</h2>
<div class="image1"><img src="Image00001.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Now that we’ve covered how to create constants and variables, you’re ready to learn how to tell your computer to make choices. This chapter is about controlling the flow of a computer program by telling the computer which path to take. When we talk about <em>flow</em>
 , we’re referring to the order in which the statements of the program are executed.</p>
<p class="indent">Up to this point, you’ve only seen statements performed in the order you’ve typed them. You’ve done some cool things with this, but by telling the computer how to make choices about the order of executing <span id="page_36"></span>
 statements, you can do even more. To get the computer to make a choice, we’ll use <em>conditional statements</em>
 that tell the computer to run some code based on a condition’s value.</p>
<p class="indent">You already use conditional statements to make choices every day! For example, before you leave home in the morning, you check the weather. If it’s sunny, you may put on a pair of sunglasses. If it’s raining, you grab your umbrella. In each case, you’re checking a condition. If the condition “it is raining” is true, then you take your umbrella when you leave the house. When the condition could be true or false, it’s called a <em>Boolean expression</em>
 . The <span class="code">Bool</span>
 data type that you learned about in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 is used to represent the value <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00076.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec1">
<strong>BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A common type of Boolean expression is one that compares two values using a <em>comparison operator</em>
 . There are six comparison operators. Let’s start with two simple ones: <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec1">
<strong>IS EQUAL AND IS NOT EQUAL</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll use the <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 comparison operators a lot. <em>Is equal</em>
 is written with two equal signs next to each other, like this: <span class="code">==</span>
 . <em>Is not equal</em>
 is written with an exclamation mark and one equal sign, like this: <span class="code">!=</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s try them both out in the playground!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00077.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In plain English, the line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 says, “three plus two equals five,” which is a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement, and the output in the right pane will confirm this as soon as you finish typing it. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the line says, “three is not equal to five,” which is also a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement. Note that <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is an error. Do you know why? While <span class="code">=</span>
 and <span class="code">==</span>
 look a lot alike, remember that a single equal sign (<span class="code">=)</span>
 assigns values. That statement reads, “Put the value of 8 into something called 3 + 5,” which doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="indent">In Swift, the <span class="code">==</span>
 operator also works with other data types, not just numbers. Let’s try making some other comparisons.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_37"></span>
 <img src="Image00078.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is a tricky one; did you expect it to be <span class="code">true</span>
 ? Those two strings are close but not exactly the same, and an <em>is equal</em>
 comparison is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if the two values match exactly. The constant <span class="code">myName</span>
 has a value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 with a capital <em>G</em>
 , which is not the same as <span class="code">"gloria"</span>
 with a lowercase <em>g</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Remember in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 when we said that you can’t use math operators like <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">*</span>
 on things that aren’t the same data type? The same is true for comparisons. You can’t compare things that are different types. The line at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 will cause an error because one is a <span class="code">String</span>
 and the other is a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2">
<strong>GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">The first item of the table shows that something that is NOT <span class="code">true</span>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>

<br />

 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<p class="noindent">Now that we’ve covered how to create constants and variables, you’re ready to learn how to tell your computer to make choices. This chapter is about controlling the flow of a computer program by telling the computer which path to take. When we talk about <em>flow</em>
 , we’re referring to the order in which the statements of the program are executed.</p>
<p class="indent">Up to this point, you’ve only seen statements performed in the order you’ve typed them. You’ve done some cool things with this, but by telling the computer how to make choices about the order of executing <span id="page_36"></span>
 statements, you can do even more. To get the computer to make a choice, we’ll use <em>conditional statements</em>
 that tell the computer to run some code based on a condition’s value.</p>
<p class="indent">You already use conditional statements to make choices every day! For example, before you leave home in the morning, you check the weather. If it’s sunny, you may put on a pair of sunglasses. If it’s raining, you grab your umbrella. In each case, you’re checking a condition. If the condition “it is raining” is true, then you take your umbrella when you leave the house. When the condition could be true or false, it’s called a <em>Boolean expression</em>
 . The <span class="code">Bool</span>
 data type that you learned about in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 is used to represent the value <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec1">
<strong>BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A common type of Boolean expression is one that compares two values using a <em>comparison operator</em>
 . There are six comparison operators. Let’s start with two simple ones: <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec1">
<strong>IS EQUAL AND IS NOT EQUAL</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll use the <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 comparison operators a lot. <em>Is equal</em>
 is written with two equal signs next to each other, like this: <span class="code">==</span>
 . <em>Is not equal</em>
 is written with an exclamation mark and one equal sign, like this: <span class="code">!=</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s try them both out in the playground!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00077.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In plain English, the line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 says, “three plus two equals five,” which is a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement, and the output in the right pane will confirm this as soon as you finish typing it. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the line says, “three is not equal to five,” which is also a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement. Note that <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is an error. Do you know why? While <span class="code">=</span>
 and <span class="code">==</span>
 look a lot alike, remember that a single equal sign (<span class="code">=)</span>
 assigns values. That statement reads, “Put the value of 8 into something called 3 + 5,” which doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="indent">In Swift, the <span class="code">==</span>
 operator also works with other data types, not just numbers. Let’s try making some other comparisons.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_37"></span>
 <img src="Image00078.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is a tricky one; did you expect it to be <span class="code">true</span>
 ? Those two strings are close but not exactly the same, and an <em>is equal</em>
 comparison is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if the two values match exactly. The constant <span class="code">myName</span>
 has a value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 with a capital <em>G</em>
 , which is not the same as <span class="code">"gloria"</span>
 with a lowercase <em>g</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Remember in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 when we said that you can’t use math operators like <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">*</span>
 on things that aren’t the same data type? The same is true for comparisons. You can’t compare things that are different types. The line at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 will cause an error because one is a <span class="code">String</span>
 and the other is a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2">
<strong>GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>

 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>

<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>

<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>

 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">Now that we’ve covered how to create constants and variables, you’re ready to learn how to tell your computer to make choices. This chapter is about controlling the flow of a computer program by telling the computer which path to take. When we talk about <em>flow</em>
 , we’re referring to the order in which the statements of the program are executed.</p>
<p class="indent">Up to this point, you’ve only seen statements performed in the order you’ve typed them. You’ve done some cool things with this, but by telling the computer how to make choices about the order of executing <span id="page_36"></span>
 statements, you can do even more. To get the computer to make a choice, we’ll use <em>conditional statements</em>
 that tell the computer to run some code based on a condition’s value.</p>
<p class="indent">You already use conditional statements to make choices every day! For example, before you leave home in the morning, you check the weather. If it’s sunny, you may put on a pair of sunglasses. If it’s raining, you grab your umbrella. In each case, you’re checking a condition. If the condition “it is raining” is true, then you take your umbrella when you leave the house. When the condition could be true or false, it’s called a <em>Boolean expression</em>
 . The <span class="code">Bool</span>
 data type that you learned about in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 is used to represent the value <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00076.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec1">
<strong>BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A common type of Boolean expression is one that compares two values using a <em>comparison operator</em>
 . There are six comparison operators. Let’s start with two simple ones: <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec1">
<strong>IS EQUAL AND IS NOT EQUAL</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll use the <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 comparison operators a lot. <em>Is equal</em>
 is written with two equal signs next to each other, like this: <span class="code">==</span>
 . <em>Is not equal</em>
 is written with an exclamation mark and one equal sign, like this: <span class="code">!=</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s try them both out in the playground!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00077.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In plain English, the line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 says, “three plus two equals five,” which is a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement, and the output in the right pane will confirm this as soon as you finish typing it. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the line says, “three is not equal to five,” which is also a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement. Note that <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is an error. Do you know why? While <span class="code">=</span>
 and <span class="code">==</span>
 look a lot alike, remember that a single equal sign (<span class="code">=)</span>
 assigns values. That statement reads, “Put the value of 8 into something called 3 + 5,” which doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="indent">In Swift, the <span class="code">==</span>
 operator also works with other data types, not just numbers. Let’s try making some other comparisons.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_37"></span>
 <img src="Image00078.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is a tricky one; did you expect it to be <span class="code">true</span>
 ? Those two strings are close but not exactly the same, and an <em>is equal</em>
 comparison is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if the two values match exactly. The constant <span class="code">myName</span>
 has a value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 with a capital <em>G</em>
 , which is not the same as <span class="code">"gloria"</span>
 with a lowercase <em>g</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Remember in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 when we said that you can’t use math operators like <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">*</span>
 on things that aren’t the same data type? The same is true for comparisons. You can’t compare things that are different types. The line at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 will cause an error because one is a <span class="code">String</span>
 and the other is a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2">
<strong>GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>

 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">The first item of the table shows that something that is NOT <span class="code">true</span>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>

<br />

 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<p class="indent">Up to this point, you’ve only seen statements performed in the order you’ve typed them. You’ve done some cool things with this, but by telling the computer how to make choices about the order of executing <span id="page_36"></span>
 statements, you can do even more. To get the computer to make a choice, we’ll use <em>conditional statements</em>
 that tell the computer to run some code based on a condition’s value.</p>
<p class="indent">You already use conditional statements to make choices every day! For example, before you leave home in the morning, you check the weather. If it’s sunny, you may put on a pair of sunglasses. If it’s raining, you grab your umbrella. In each case, you’re checking a condition. If the condition “it is raining” is true, then you take your umbrella when you leave the house. When the condition could be true or false, it’s called a <em>Boolean expression</em>
 . The <span class="code">Bool</span>
 data type that you learned about in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 is used to represent the value <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec1">
<strong>BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A common type of Boolean expression is one that compares two values using a <em>comparison operator</em>
 . There are six comparison operators. Let’s start with two simple ones: <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec1">
<strong>IS EQUAL AND IS NOT EQUAL</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll use the <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 comparison operators a lot. <em>Is equal</em>
 is written with two equal signs next to each other, like this: <span class="code">==</span>
 . <em>Is not equal</em>
 is written with an exclamation mark and one equal sign, like this: <span class="code">!=</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s try them both out in the playground!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00077.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In plain English, the line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 says, “three plus two equals five,” which is a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement, and the output in the right pane will confirm this as soon as you finish typing it. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the line says, “three is not equal to five,” which is also a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement. Note that <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is an error. Do you know why? While <span class="code">=</span>
 and <span class="code">==</span>
 look a lot alike, remember that a single equal sign (<span class="code">=)</span>
 assigns values. That statement reads, “Put the value of 8 into something called 3 + 5,” which doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="indent">In Swift, the <span class="code">==</span>
 operator also works with other data types, not just numbers. Let’s try making some other comparisons.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_37"></span>
 <img src="Image00078.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is a tricky one; did you expect it to be <span class="code">true</span>
 ? Those two strings are close but not exactly the same, and an <em>is equal</em>
 comparison is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if the two values match exactly. The constant <span class="code">myName</span>
 has a value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 with a capital <em>G</em>
 , which is not the same as <span class="code">"gloria"</span>
 with a lowercase <em>g</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Remember in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 when we said that you can’t use math operators like <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">*</span>
 on things that aren’t the same data type? The same is true for comparisons. You can’t compare things that are different types. The line at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 will cause an error because one is a <span class="code">String</span>
 and the other is a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2">
<strong>GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

</table>
<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>

 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>

<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>

<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>

 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">You already use conditional statements to make choices every day! For example, before you leave home in the morning, you check the weather. If it’s sunny, you may put on a pair of sunglasses. If it’s raining, you grab your umbrella. In each case, you’re checking a condition. If the condition “it is raining” is true, then you take your umbrella when you leave the house. When the condition could be true or false, it’s called a <em>Boolean expression</em>
 . The <span class="code">Bool</span>
 data type that you learned about in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 is used to represent the value <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00076.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec1">
<strong>BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A common type of Boolean expression is one that compares two values using a <em>comparison operator</em>
 . There are six comparison operators. Let’s start with two simple ones: <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec1">
<strong>IS EQUAL AND IS NOT EQUAL</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll use the <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 comparison operators a lot. <em>Is equal</em>
 is written with two equal signs next to each other, like this: <span class="code">==</span>
 . <em>Is not equal</em>
 is written with an exclamation mark and one equal sign, like this: <span class="code">!=</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s try them both out in the playground!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00077.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In plain English, the line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 says, “three plus two equals five,” which is a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement, and the output in the right pane will confirm this as soon as you finish typing it. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the line says, “three is not equal to five,” which is also a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement. Note that <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is an error. Do you know why? While <span class="code">=</span>
 and <span class="code">==</span>
 look a lot alike, remember that a single equal sign (<span class="code">=)</span>
 assigns values. That statement reads, “Put the value of 8 into something called 3 + 5,” which doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="indent">In Swift, the <span class="code">==</span>
 operator also works with other data types, not just numbers. Let’s try making some other comparisons.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_37"></span>
 <img src="Image00078.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is a tricky one; did you expect it to be <span class="code">true</span>
 ? Those two strings are close but not exactly the same, and an <em>is equal</em>
 comparison is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if the two values match exactly. The constant <span class="code">myName</span>
 has a value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 with a capital <em>G</em>
 , which is not the same as <span class="code">"gloria"</span>
 with a lowercase <em>g</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Remember in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 when we said that you can’t use math operators like <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">*</span>
 on things that aren’t the same data type? The same is true for comparisons. You can’t compare things that are different types. The line at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 will cause an error because one is a <span class="code">String</span>
 and the other is a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2">
<strong>GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<strong>BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A common type of Boolean expression is one that compares two values using a <em>comparison operator</em>
 . There are six comparison operators. Let’s start with two simple ones: <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec1">
<strong>IS EQUAL AND IS NOT EQUAL</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll use the <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 comparison operators a lot. <em>Is equal</em>
 is written with two equal signs next to each other, like this: <span class="code">==</span>
 . <em>Is not equal</em>
 is written with an exclamation mark and one equal sign, like this: <span class="code">!=</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s try them both out in the playground!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00077.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In plain English, the line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 says, “three plus two equals five,” which is a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement, and the output in the right pane will confirm this as soon as you finish typing it. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the line says, “three is not equal to five,” which is also a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement. Note that <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is an error. Do you know why? While <span class="code">=</span>
 and <span class="code">==</span>
 look a lot alike, remember that a single equal sign (<span class="code">=)</span>
 assigns values. That statement reads, “Put the value of 8 into something called 3 + 5,” which doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="indent">In Swift, the <span class="code">==</span>
 operator also works with other data types, not just numbers. Let’s try making some other comparisons.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_37"></span>
 <img src="Image00078.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is a tricky one; did you expect it to be <span class="code">true</span>
 ? Those two strings are close but not exactly the same, and an <em>is equal</em>
 comparison is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if the two values match exactly. The constant <span class="code">myName</span>
 has a value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 with a capital <em>G</em>
 , which is not the same as <span class="code">"gloria"</span>
 with a lowercase <em>g</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Remember in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 when we said that you can’t use math operators like <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">*</span>
 on things that aren’t the same data type? The same is true for comparisons. You can’t compare things that are different types. The line at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 will cause an error because one is a <span class="code">String</span>
 and the other is a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2">
<strong>GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>

 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec1">
<strong>BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A common type of Boolean expression is one that compares two values using a <em>comparison operator</em>
 . There are six comparison operators. Let’s start with two simple ones: <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec1">
<strong>IS EQUAL AND IS NOT EQUAL</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll use the <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 comparison operators a lot. <em>Is equal</em>
 is written with two equal signs next to each other, like this: <span class="code">==</span>
 . <em>Is not equal</em>
 is written with an exclamation mark and one equal sign, like this: <span class="code">!=</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s try them both out in the playground!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00077.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In plain English, the line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 says, “three plus two equals five,” which is a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement, and the output in the right pane will confirm this as soon as you finish typing it. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the line says, “three is not equal to five,” which is also a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement. Note that <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is an error. Do you know why? While <span class="code">=</span>
 and <span class="code">==</span>
 look a lot alike, remember that a single equal sign (<span class="code">=)</span>
 assigns values. That statement reads, “Put the value of 8 into something called 3 + 5,” which doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="indent">In Swift, the <span class="code">==</span>
 operator also works with other data types, not just numbers. Let’s try making some other comparisons.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_37"></span>
 <img src="Image00078.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is a tricky one; did you expect it to be <span class="code">true</span>
 ? Those two strings are close but not exactly the same, and an <em>is equal</em>
 comparison is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if the two values match exactly. The constant <span class="code">myName</span>
 has a value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 with a capital <em>G</em>
 , which is not the same as <span class="code">"gloria"</span>
 with a lowercase <em>g</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Remember in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 when we said that you can’t use math operators like <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">*</span>
 on things that aren’t the same data type? The same is true for comparisons. You can’t compare things that are different types. The line at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 will cause an error because one is a <span class="code">String</span>
 and the other is a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2">
<strong>GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">A common type of Boolean expression is one that compares two values using a <em>comparison operator</em>
 . There are six comparison operators. Let’s start with two simple ones: <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec1">
<strong>IS EQUAL AND IS NOT EQUAL</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll use the <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 comparison operators a lot. <em>Is equal</em>
 is written with two equal signs next to each other, like this: <span class="code">==</span>
 . <em>Is not equal</em>
 is written with an exclamation mark and one equal sign, like this: <span class="code">!=</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s try them both out in the playground!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00077.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In plain English, the line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 says, “three plus two equals five,” which is a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement, and the output in the right pane will confirm this as soon as you finish typing it. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the line says, “three is not equal to five,” which is also a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement. Note that <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is an error. Do you know why? While <span class="code">=</span>
 and <span class="code">==</span>
 look a lot alike, remember that a single equal sign (<span class="code">=)</span>
 assigns values. That statement reads, “Put the value of 8 into something called 3 + 5,” which doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="indent">In Swift, the <span class="code">==</span>
 operator also works with other data types, not just numbers. Let’s try making some other comparisons.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_37"></span>
 <img src="Image00078.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is a tricky one; did you expect it to be <span class="code">true</span>
 ? Those two strings are close but not exactly the same, and an <em>is equal</em>
 comparison is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if the two values match exactly. The constant <span class="code">myName</span>
 has a value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 with a capital <em>G</em>
 , which is not the same as <span class="code">"gloria"</span>
 with a lowercase <em>g</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Remember in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 when we said that you can’t use math operators like <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">*</span>
 on things that aren’t the same data type? The same is true for comparisons. You can’t compare things that are different types. The line at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 will cause an error because one is a <span class="code">String</span>
 and the other is a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>

<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec1">
<strong>IS EQUAL AND IS NOT EQUAL</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll use the <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 comparison operators a lot. <em>Is equal</em>
 is written with two equal signs next to each other, like this: <span class="code">==</span>
 . <em>Is not equal</em>
 is written with an exclamation mark and one equal sign, like this: <span class="code">!=</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s try them both out in the playground!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00077.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In plain English, the line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 says, “three plus two equals five,” which is a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement, and the output in the right pane will confirm this as soon as you finish typing it. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the line says, “three is not equal to five,” which is also a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement. Note that <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is an error. Do you know why? While <span class="code">=</span>
 and <span class="code">==</span>
 look a lot alike, remember that a single equal sign (<span class="code">=)</span>
 assigns values. That statement reads, “Put the value of 8 into something called 3 + 5,” which doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="indent">In Swift, the <span class="code">==</span>
 operator also works with other data types, not just numbers. Let’s try making some other comparisons.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_37"></span>
 <img src="Image00078.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is a tricky one; did you expect it to be <span class="code">true</span>
 ? Those two strings are close but not exactly the same, and an <em>is equal</em>
 comparison is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if the two values match exactly. The constant <span class="code">myName</span>
 has a value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 with a capital <em>G</em>
 , which is not the same as <span class="code">"gloria"</span>
 with a lowercase <em>g</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Remember in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 when we said that you can’t use math operators like <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">*</span>
 on things that aren’t the same data type? The same is true for comparisons. You can’t compare things that are different types. The line at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 will cause an error because one is a <span class="code">String</span>
 and the other is a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2">
<strong>GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

</table>
<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . This means that the expressions on both sides of the <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 operator must be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 . A compound expression that is <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 <span class="code">false</span>
 will evaluate to <span class="code">false</span>
 . And a compound <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 expression in which both conditions are <span class="code">false</span>
 will also evaluate to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When it comes to the OR operator, only one of the expressions on either side of the <span class="code">||</span>
 operator must be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the <span class="code">||</span>
 expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 . Therefore, a <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">||</span>
 <span class="code">true</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , and a <span class="code">true ||</span>
 <span class="code">false</span>
 is also <span class="code">true</span>
 . Only a compound OR expression in which both sides are <span class="code">false</span>
 ends up being <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">You’ll use the <em>is equal</em>
 and <em>is not equal</em>
 comparison operators a lot. <em>Is equal</em>
 is written with two equal signs next to each other, like this: <span class="code">==</span>
 . <em>Is not equal</em>
 is written with an exclamation mark and one equal sign, like this: <span class="code">!=</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s try them both out in the playground!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00077.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In plain English, the line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 says, “three plus two equals five,” which is a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement, and the output in the right pane will confirm this as soon as you finish typing it. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the line says, “three is not equal to five,” which is also a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement. Note that <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is an error. Do you know why? While <span class="code">=</span>
 and <span class="code">==</span>
 look a lot alike, remember that a single equal sign (<span class="code">=)</span>
 assigns values. That statement reads, “Put the value of 8 into something called 3 + 5,” which doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="indent">In Swift, the <span class="code">==</span>
 operator also works with other data types, not just numbers. Let’s try making some other comparisons.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_37"></span>
 <img src="Image00078.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is a tricky one; did you expect it to be <span class="code">true</span>
 ? Those two strings are close but not exactly the same, and an <em>is equal</em>
 comparison is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if the two values match exactly. The constant <span class="code">myName</span>
 has a value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 with a capital <em>G</em>
 , which is not the same as <span class="code">"gloria"</span>
 with a lowercase <em>g</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Remember in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 when we said that you can’t use math operators like <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">*</span>
 on things that aren’t the same data type? The same is true for comparisons. You can’t compare things that are different types. The line at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 will cause an error because one is a <span class="code">String</span>
 and the other is a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2">
<strong>GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">The first item of the table shows that something that is NOT <span class="code">true</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Similarly, something that is NOT <span class="code">false</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">With the AND operator, only something that is <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 <span class="code">true</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . This means that the expressions on both sides of the <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 operator must be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 . A compound expression that is <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 <span class="code">false</span>
 will evaluate to <span class="code">false</span>
 . And a compound <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>

<p class="indent">When it comes to the OR operator, only one of the expressions on either side of the <span class="code">||</span>

 is <span class="code">true</span>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>

<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>

</html>
<p class="indent">Let’s try them both out in the playground!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00077.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In plain English, the line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 says, “three plus two equals five,” which is a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement, and the output in the right pane will confirm this as soon as you finish typing it. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the line says, “three is not equal to five,” which is also a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement. Note that <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is an error. Do you know why? While <span class="code">=</span>
 and <span class="code">==</span>
 look a lot alike, remember that a single equal sign (<span class="code">=)</span>
 assigns values. That statement reads, “Put the value of 8 into something called 3 + 5,” which doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="indent">In Swift, the <span class="code">==</span>
 operator also works with other data types, not just numbers. Let’s try making some other comparisons.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_37"></span>
 <img src="Image00078.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is a tricky one; did you expect it to be <span class="code">true</span>
 ? Those two strings are close but not exactly the same, and an <em>is equal</em>
 comparison is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if the two values match exactly. The constant <span class="code">myName</span>
 has a value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 with a capital <em>G</em>
 , which is not the same as <span class="code">"gloria"</span>
 with a lowercase <em>g</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Remember in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 when we said that you can’t use math operators like <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">*</span>
 on things that aren’t the same data type? The same is true for comparisons. You can’t compare things that are different types. The line at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 will cause an error because one is a <span class="code">String</span>
 and the other is a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2">
<strong>GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

</table>
<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>

<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>

<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>

 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">

 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>

 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00077.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In plain English, the line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 says, “three plus two equals five,” which is a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement, and the output in the right pane will confirm this as soon as you finish typing it. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the line says, “three is not equal to five,” which is also a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement. Note that <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is an error. Do you know why? While <span class="code">=</span>
 and <span class="code">==</span>
 look a lot alike, remember that a single equal sign (<span class="code">=)</span>
 assigns values. That statement reads, “Put the value of 8 into something called 3 + 5,” which doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="indent">In Swift, the <span class="code">==</span>
 operator also works with other data types, not just numbers. Let’s try making some other comparisons.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_37"></span>
 <img src="Image00078.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is a tricky one; did you expect it to be <span class="code">true</span>
 ? Those two strings are close but not exactly the same, and an <em>is equal</em>
 comparison is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if the two values match exactly. The constant <span class="code">myName</span>
 has a value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 with a capital <em>G</em>
 , which is not the same as <span class="code">"gloria"</span>
 with a lowercase <em>g</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Remember in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 when we said that you can’t use math operators like <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">*</span>
 on things that aren’t the same data type? The same is true for comparisons. You can’t compare things that are different types. The line at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 will cause an error because one is a <span class="code">String</span>
 and the other is a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2">
<strong>GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">

<p class="indent">The first item of the table shows that something that is NOT <span class="code">true</span>

<p class="indent">With the AND operator, only something that is <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00088.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<p class="indent">In plain English, the line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 says, “three plus two equals five,” which is a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement, and the output in the right pane will confirm this as soon as you finish typing it. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the line says, “three is not equal to five,” which is also a <span class="code">true</span>
 statement. Note that <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is an error. Do you know why? While <span class="code">=</span>
 and <span class="code">==</span>
 look a lot alike, remember that a single equal sign (<span class="code">=)</span>
 assigns values. That statement reads, “Put the value of 8 into something called 3 + 5,” which doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="indent">In Swift, the <span class="code">==</span>
 operator also works with other data types, not just numbers. Let’s try making some other comparisons.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_37"></span>
 <img src="Image00078.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is a tricky one; did you expect it to be <span class="code">true</span>
 ? Those two strings are close but not exactly the same, and an <em>is equal</em>
 comparison is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if the two values match exactly. The constant <span class="code">myName</span>
 has a value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 with a capital <em>G</em>
 , which is not the same as <span class="code">"gloria"</span>
 with a lowercase <em>g</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Remember in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 when we said that you can’t use math operators like <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">*</span>
 on things that aren’t the same data type? The same is true for comparisons. You can’t compare things that are different types. The line at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 will cause an error because one is a <span class="code">String</span>
 and the other is a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2">
<strong>GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>

 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>

 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">In Swift, the <span class="code">==</span>
 operator also works with other data types, not just numbers. Let’s try making some other comparisons.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_37"></span>
 <img src="Image00078.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is a tricky one; did you expect it to be <span class="code">true</span>
 ? Those two strings are close but not exactly the same, and an <em>is equal</em>
 comparison is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if the two values match exactly. The constant <span class="code">myName</span>
 has a value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 with a capital <em>G</em>
 , which is not the same as <span class="code">"gloria"</span>
 with a lowercase <em>g</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Remember in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 when we said that you can’t use math operators like <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">*</span>
 on things that aren’t the same data type? The same is true for comparisons. You can’t compare things that are different types. The line at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 will cause an error because one is a <span class="code">String</span>
 and the other is a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2">
<strong>GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

</table>
<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<div class="image"><span id="page_37"></span>
 <img src="Image00078.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is a tricky one; did you expect it to be <span class="code">true</span>
 ? Those two strings are close but not exactly the same, and an <em>is equal</em>
 comparison is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if the two values match exactly. The constant <span class="code">myName</span>
 has a value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 with a capital <em>G</em>
 , which is not the same as <span class="code">"gloria"</span>
 with a lowercase <em>g</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Remember in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 when we said that you can’t use math operators like <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">*</span>
 on things that aren’t the same data type? The same is true for comparisons. You can’t compare things that are different types. The line at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 will cause an error because one is a <span class="code">String</span>
 and the other is a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2">
<strong>GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">The first item of the table shows that something that is NOT <span class="code">true</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Similarly, something that is NOT <span class="code">false</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">With the AND operator, only something that is <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 <span class="code">true</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>

 operator must be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>

 <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">The line at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is a tricky one; did you expect it to be <span class="code">true</span>
 ? Those two strings are close but not exactly the same, and an <em>is equal</em>
 comparison is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if the two values match exactly. The constant <span class="code">myName</span>
 has a value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 with a capital <em>G</em>
 , which is not the same as <span class="code">"gloria"</span>
 with a lowercase <em>g</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Remember in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 when we said that you can’t use math operators like <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">*</span>
 on things that aren’t the same data type? The same is true for comparisons. You can’t compare things that are different types. The line at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 will cause an error because one is a <span class="code">String</span>
 and the other is a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2">
<strong>GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>

 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>

 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>

</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Remember in <a href="text00012.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 when we said that you can’t use math operators like <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">*</span>
 on things that aren’t the same data type? The same is true for comparisons. You can’t compare things that are different types. The line at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 will cause an error because one is a <span class="code">String</span>
 and the other is a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2">
<strong>GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec2">
<strong>GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">The first item of the table shows that something that is NOT <span class="code">true</span>

<p class="indent">With the AND operator, only something that is <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />

      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>

<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at four other comparison operators. We’ll start with <em>greater than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&gt;</span>
 ) and <em>less than</em>
 (written as <span class="code">&lt;</span>
 ). You probably already have a good idea of how these work. A Boolean expression like <span class="code">9 &gt; 7</span>
 , which reads “9 is greater than 7,” is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Often, you’ll also want to know if something is greater than or equal to something or less than or equal to something. There are two more operators that cover those cases: <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&gt;=</span>
 ) and <em>less than or equal to</em>
 (which looks like <span class="code">&lt;=</span>
 ). Let’s try these out with some more examples:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00079.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note the difference between <em>greater than or equal to</em>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and <em>greater than</em>
 at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . The sum of <span class="code">3 + 4</span>
 is not greater than <span class="code">7</span>
 , but it is greater than or equal to <span class="code">7</span>
 . Similarly, <span class="code">5 + 6</span>
 is less than or equal to <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , but it’s not less than <span class="code">11</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>
 .</p>

</table>
<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>

 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>

 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">The first item of the table shows that something that is NOT <span class="code">true</span>

<p class="indent">With the AND operator, only something that is <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>

<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>

      <span class="blue">print</span>

 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>

 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>

<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>

 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

 ends up being <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec2">
<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">You’ll find yourself using these operators often when you write conditional statements.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec3">
<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">The first item of the table shows that something that is NOT <span class="code">true</span>

<p class="indent">With the AND operator, only something that is <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 <span class="code">true</span>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>

<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<strong>COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>
 .</p>

</table>
<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">

<p class="indent">The first item of the table shows that something that is NOT <span class="code">true</span>

<p class="indent">With the AND operator, only something that is <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 <span class="code">true</span>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<p class="noindent">Compound Boolean expressions are simple Boolean expressions that have been joined together. It’s a lot like making compound sentences in English with the words <em>and</em>
 and <em>or</em>
 . In programming, there is a third case: <em>not</em>
 . In Swift, we call these words <em>logical operators</em>
 . A logical operator either combines a Boolean expression with another one or negates it. The three logical operators in Swift are shown in <a href="text00013.html#ch3tab2">Table 3-2</a>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>

 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>

<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>

<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

 is also <span class="code">true</span>
 . Only a compound OR expression in which both sides are <span class="code">false</span>
 ends up being <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec2">
<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00088.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00088.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">With logical operators, you can write statements that test if a value falls within a range, such as, “Is this person’s age between 10 and 15?” You would do this by testing if the age is greater than 10 <em>and</em>
 less than 15 at the same time, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00080.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />

 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">The first item of the table shows that something that is NOT <span class="code">true</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>

<p class="indent">With the AND operator, only something that is <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 <span class="code">true</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>

  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>

<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">The statement <span class="code">age &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; age &lt; 15</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 because both the conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 : <span class="code">age</span>
 is greater than 10 and less than 15. An AND statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 only if both conditions are <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>

</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_39"></span>
 Try changing the value of <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18 to see what happens:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">The first item of the table shows that something that is NOT <span class="code">true</span>

<p class="indent">With the AND operator, only something that is <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00081.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">The first item of the table shows that something that is NOT <span class="code">true</span>

<p class="indent">With the AND operator, only something that is <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>

 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Because we changed <span class="code">age</span>
 to 18, only one side of the statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 . The variable <span class="code">age</span>
 is still greater than 10, but it’s no longer less than 15, so our expression evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>

  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />

<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Now test out OR by entering this code in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>

<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>

  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00082.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>

<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>

 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>

 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">First, we make up a person named Jacqueline by setting the constant <span class="code">name</span>
 to <span class="code">"Jacqueline"</span>
 . Next, we test some conditions to see if they are <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Because <span class="code">name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , the OR statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 even though <span class="code">name == "Jack"</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . In English, this statement says, “This person’s name is Jack <em>or</em>
 this person’s name is Jacqueline.” In an OR statement, only one of the conditions needs to be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the whole expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

</div>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00083.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">

 operator must be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the <span class="code">||</span>
 expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 . Therefore, a <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">||</span>
 <span class="code">true</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , and a <span class="code">true ||</span>
 <span class="code">false</span>

 . Only a compound OR expression in which both sides are <span class="code">false</span>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00088.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using some NOT statements. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">
<a href="text00013.html#ch3tab3">Table 3-3</a>

 <span class="code">true</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . This means that the expressions on both sides of the <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 operator must be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 . A compound expression that is <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 <span class="code">false</span>
 will evaluate to <span class="code">false</span>
 . And a compound <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 expression in which both conditions are <span class="code">false</span>
 will also evaluate to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When it comes to the OR operator, only one of the expressions on either side of the <span class="code">||</span>
 operator must be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the <span class="code">||</span>

 . Therefore, a <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">||</span>
 <span class="code">true</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , and a <span class="code">true ||</span>

 is also <span class="code">true</span>
 . Only a compound OR expression in which both sides are <span class="code">false</span>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00084.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00088.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">!</span>
 operator is used in the compound Boolean statement <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , which you could read as “Our person is <em>not</em>
 a girl <em>and</em>
 our person is named Jack.” That statement has two logical operators, <span class="code">!</span>
 and <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 . You can combine as many logical operators as you want when you write compound Boolean expressions.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Sometimes it’s a good idea to use parentheses to let the computer know what to evaluate first. Parentheses also make the code easier to read. This is similar to how you use parentheses when you use several math operations in one equation, as described in “<a href="text00012.html#ch02lev2sec8">Ordering Operations with Parentheses</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_30">page 30</a>
 . At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we use parentheses to tell the computer to first check <span class="code">!isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jack"</span>
 and then check <span class="code">isAGirl &amp;&amp; name == "Jacqueline"</span>
 . After it has evaluated both parts, the computer can evaluate the OR part for the entire statement, which will be <span class="code">true</span>
 because the second part is <span class="code">true</span>
 . Again, in an OR statement, the whole expression is <span class="code">true</span>
 if any of the conditions is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

 . And a compound <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 expression in which both conditions are <span class="code">false</span>
 will also evaluate to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When it comes to the OR operator, only one of the expressions on either side of the <span class="code">||</span>
 operator must be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the <span class="code">||</span>
 expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 . Therefore, a <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">||</span>
 <span class="code">true</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , and a <span class="code">true ||</span>
 <span class="code">false</span>
 is also <span class="code">true</span>
 . Only a compound OR expression in which both sides are <span class="code">false</span>
 ends up being <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>

 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<p class="indent">The first item of the table shows that something that is NOT <span class="code">true</span>
 is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Similarly, something that is NOT <span class="code">false</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">With the AND operator, only something that is <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 <span class="code">true</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . This means that the expressions on both sides of the <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 operator must be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 . A compound expression that is <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 <span class="code">false</span>
 will evaluate to <span class="code">false</span>
 . And a compound <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 expression in which both conditions are <span class="code">false</span>
 will also evaluate to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When it comes to the OR operator, only one of the expressions on either side of the <span class="code">||</span>
 operator must be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the <span class="code">||</span>
 expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 . Therefore, a <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">||</span>
 <span class="code">true</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , and a <span class="code">true ||</span>
 <span class="code">false</span>
 is also <span class="code">true</span>
 . Only a compound OR expression in which both sides are <span class="code">false</span>
 ends up being <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>

<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">

This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">With the AND operator, only something that is <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 <span class="code">true</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . This means that the expressions on both sides of the <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 operator must be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 . A compound expression that is <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 <span class="code">false</span>
 will evaluate to <span class="code">false</span>
 . And a compound <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
 expression in which both conditions are <span class="code">false</span>
 will also evaluate to <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When it comes to the OR operator, only one of the expressions on either side of the <span class="code">||</span>
 operator must be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the <span class="code">||</span>
 expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 . Therefore, a <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">||</span>
 <span class="code">true</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , and a <span class="code">true ||</span>
 <span class="code">false</span>
 is also <span class="code">true</span>
 . Only a compound OR expression in which both sides are <span class="code">false</span>
 ends up being <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec2">
<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>

 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>

 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>

 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>

 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>

 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<p class="indent">When it comes to the OR operator, only one of the expressions on either side of the <span class="code">||</span>
 operator must be <span class="code">true</span>
 for the <span class="code">||</span>
 expression to be <span class="code">true</span>
 . Therefore, a <span class="code">true</span>
 <span class="code">||</span>
 <span class="code">true</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 , and a <span class="code">true ||</span>
 <span class="code">false</span>
 is also <span class="code">true</span>
 . Only a compound OR expression in which both sides are <span class="code">false</span>
 ends up being <span class="code">false</span>
 .</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec2">
<strong>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement. These statements present the computer with a condition that the computer makes a choice based on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>

<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>

 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />

 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>

 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>

  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>

 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>

 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<p class="noindent">Conditional statements fall into two categories: the <span class="code">if</span>

<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>

 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>

 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />

 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec4">
<strong>IF STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>

 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>

</html>
<p class="noindent">An <span class="code">if</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 followed by a <em>condition</em>
 , which is always a Boolean expression. The computer examines the condition and executes the code inside the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement if the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 or skips over that code if the condition is <span class="code">false</span>
 . Let’s write some code that tests whether a kid is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">49.5</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00087.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>

      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>

<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_41"></span>
 Here, we set 48 inches as the minimum height at which a kid can ride our roller coaster alone, and we set our rider’s height to 49.5 inches. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we test whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . If it is, the program says that they are tall enough to ride the roller coaster. To write our <span class="code">if</span>
 statement, we put the keyword <span class="code">if</span>
 in front of the condition <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 . Then we wrap the code that we want to execute when that condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 in a set of braces <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Because our rider is tall enough, the computer will print <span class="code">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00085.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>

 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>

 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>

  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>

<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

</div>
<p class="noindent">Hooray!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec5"><span id="page_44"></span>
 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>

      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Let’s see what happens if we change our rider’s height. Change <span class="code">height</span>
 to a number less than 48.0. This time, because the condition in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 , the program skips all of the code in the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and nothing happens.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec1">
<strong>else Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideWithAdult = <span class="blue1">36.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 )<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00086.jpg" alt="image" />

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch03fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">

<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>

 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>

 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>
 . In plain English, this is like saying, “If the rider is tall enough to ride the roller coaster, say they can ride it. Else, say they can’t.”</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">let</span>
 heightToRideAlone = <span class="blue1">48.0</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>

<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 height = <span class="blue1">47.5</span>
<br />
  <span id="page_42"></span>
 <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone."</span>
 )<br />

  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than or equal to <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>

 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00090.jpg" alt="image" />
 <span id="page_46"></span>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to tell the computer to do one thing if a statement is <span class="code">true</span>
 but something else if that statement is <span class="code">false</span>
 . To do this, after the <span class="code">if</span>
 statement and block of code, just type the keyword <span class="code">else</span>
 followed by another block of code that you want to execute when the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition isn’t <span class="code">true</span>
 . If the rider isn’t tall enough to meet the condition, let’s have the computer tell them they can’t ride the roller coaster:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">height</span>
 &gt;= <span class="green1">heightToRideAlone</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 )<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now if you change the rider’s height to less than 48 inches, you’ll see <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
 That’s because the <span class="code">else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 tells the computer to print that message if the statement evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>

<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="ch03lev3sec2">
<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">

 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>

 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 to find out.</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>

<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>

 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>

 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>

<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />

<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>

<strong>else if Statements</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We could also test different conditions for the rider’s height to create more rules for riding the roller coaster. We can do this by adding <span class="code">else if</span>
 conditions. Let’s add a new minimum height that requires the kid to ride with an adult:</p>
<div class="box">

  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 checks whether the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>

 . If a rider is shorter than 48 inches but taller than 36 inches, then the line <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 appears in the results pane. If they are too short to ride alone or with an adult, then the computer prints <span class="code">"Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster."</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />

    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />

</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>

This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read.

<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />

 <span class="blue1">1</span>

      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>

      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>

<br />

 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>

      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>

<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>

<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />

 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />

 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>

      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>

<br />

 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>

      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>

<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>

<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="code">else if</span>
 statements are neat because you can use them to test lots of different conditions, but it’s very important that you pay attention to the order of these conditions. To show you what we mean, change the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 to <span class="code">50.0</span>
 so that they are tall enough to ride alone. Then, change the order of the conditions in our <span class="code">if else</span>
 statement by making <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 the first condition and <span class="code">height &gt;= heightToRideAlone</span>
 the second condition. What do you think will be printed? Take a look at <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>

 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>

 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>

<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

 <em>Figure 3-1: Be careful with your ordering of <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>
 —and that <span class="code">else</span>
 must be last. The <span class="code">else</span>
 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<p class="box-title">
<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>

 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>

<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>

<p class="indent">You can see that even though the rider is taller than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 , the program prints <span class="code">"You can ride this roller coaster with an adult."</span>
 which is the expected output for a rider whose <span class="code">height</span>
 is greater than <span class="code">heightToRideWithAdult</span>
 but less than <span class="code">heightToRideAlone</span>
 . We get this result because the rider’s <span class="code">height</span>
 <span id="page_43"></span>
 matches the first condition, so the computer prints the first sentence and doesn’t bother checking anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">Once any part of an <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement is found to be <span class="code">true</span>
 , the rest of the conditions won’t be checked. In our example in <a href="text00013.html#ch03fig1">Figure 3-1</a>
 , the first condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , so the rest of the conditions are skipped. This can lead to unexpected results in your programs, so if you ever run into problems in your <span class="code">if</span>
 or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, check the order of the conditions!</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re working with <span class="code">if</span>
 , <span class="code">else</span>
 , or <span class="code">else if</span>
 statements, there are a few important rules. The first is that you can’t have an <span class="code">else</span>
 or an <span class="code">else if</span>
 statement unless you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement first. The second is that although you can have as many <span class="code">else</span>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 s as you want after an <span class="code">if</span>
 , you can have only one <span class="code">else</span>

 is the catch-all case if none of the other things has happened.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 and write a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement that makes the computer do something different based on the value of <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finds the first match, that block of code is executed. Take a look at the following code, which assigns student projects for different grade levels:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentGrade = <span class="blue1">5</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 studentProject = <span class="red">"To be determined"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">switch</span>
 <span class="green1">studentGrade</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A country of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">2</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"The Iditarod"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">3</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Native Americans"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">4</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"A state of the student's choice"</span>
<br />
  <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">5</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Colonial times"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">case</span>
 <span class="blue1">6</span>
 , <span class="blue1">7</span>
 , <span class="blue1">8</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"Student's choice"</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="pink">default</span>
 :<br />
      <span class="green1">studentProject</span>
 = <span class="red">"N/A"</span>
<br />
  }</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>

<p class="indent">The <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement starts with the keyword <span class="code">switch</span>
 followed by the <em>control expression</em>
 . In this example, the control expression is the variable <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">After the control expression, a set of braces begins at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , and the body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is inside these braces.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00089.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The body of the <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement is made up of one or more cases. In this example, there are six cases total. Each case starts with the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 followed by a value and a colon, as shown at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . If a <span class="code">case</span>
 statement matches the control expression, the code just after the case will run. Each case must have at least one line of code, or you’ll get an error. In this example, <span class="code">switch</span>
 is used to change the string assigned to the variable <span class="code">studentProject</span>
 from <span class="code">"To be determined"</span>
 to the string in the case that matches the control expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_45"></span>
 Note that you can have multiple cases all do the same thing. You can see that students in grades 6, 7, and 8 all get to choose their own projects <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . We specify this by writing the keyword <span class="code">case</span>
 and then a comma-separated list of values.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

<strong>CODE WITH STYLE</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Pay close attention to the coding style that we use in this book. By <em>coding style</em>
 , we mean the way that the code is written, the number of spaces used, the indentation of certain lines, and what things go on a new line. Take a look at this code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// The opening brace, {, of a block of code goes on<br />
// the same line as the condition<br />
if height &gt;= heightToRideAlone {<br />
<br />
    // Statements inside a block of code should be indented by 4 spaces<br />
    print("You are tall enough to ride this roller coaster alone.")<br />
<br />
// The closing brace, }, of a block of code goes at the start of a new line<br />
} else if height &gt;= heightToRideWithAdult {<br />
<br />
    // Extra blank lines can be added between statements<br />
    // to make the code look less crowded<br />
<br />
    print("You can ride this roller coaster with an adult.")<br />
<br />
} else {<br />
<br />
    print("Sorry. You cannot ride this roller coaster.")<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Notice that after the <span class="code">if</span>
 condition we leave a space and then place the opening brace, <span class="code">{</span>
 , on the same line. The block’s closing brace, <span class="code">}</span>
 , always goes at the start of the next new line. The statements contained within the braces are indented by four spaces. This is something that Xcode does automatically for you to make the code more readable. Feel free to add blank lines if it makes it easier for you to read. In general, you should always have at least one blank line before a chunk of code such as an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement.</p>

 <strong>SWITCH STATEMENTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Whereas an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement is used only to evaluate a Boolean expression (something that must be <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 ), a <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement can evaluate and branch out on any number of conditions. You could use a <span class="code">switch</span>
 to check the value of an integer and tell the computer to do one thing if the integer equals <span class="code">1</span>
 , something else if the integer equals <span class="code">2</span>
 , and so on. Or, you could create a string called <span class="code">dayOfTheWeek</span>

 statement must account for every possible case or value of the control expression. In our example, because <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , our <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement needs to have a case for all possible <span class="code">Int</span>
 values. But this would take a really long time to write since there are so many! For example, –7 is an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , as is 1,000. Do you really want to write 1,000 cases?</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of writing a separate case for every value, you can use the keyword <span class="code">default</span>
 as the last case, as we did at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . You simply type <span class="code">default</span>
 followed by a colon (<span class="code">default:</span>
 ) and then whatever code you want to run if none of the other cases match. Notice that the <span class="code">default</span>
 case doesn’t have the word <span class="code">case</span>
 in front of it. The <span class="code">default</span>
 case is really helpful for taking care of values that you might not expect and lets you avoid writing so many <span class="code">case</span>
 statements. In this example, we expect a value only of 1 through 8 for <span class="code">studentGrade</span>
 , so we use the <span class="code">default</span>
 case to cover all other possible values.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this <span class="code">switch</span>
 statement and see what you get. Then try changing the values to test for different conditions. Play around with it!</p>

<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to program the computer to make choices based on conditions using <span class="code">if</span>
 and <span class="code">switch</span>
 statements. You learned how to write Boolean expressions and compound expressions, and about the different comparison operators. Conditional statements are an essential programming tool and are seen in almost every useful program. In <a href="text00014.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 , we’re going to tackle another important type of programming statement—the loop. Loops tell the computer to do something over and over again until it is time to stop the loop.</p>

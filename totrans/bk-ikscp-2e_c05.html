			</header>
			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="77"/>There are few useful things you
can do in Inkscape without first selecting some
object or objects. Of all Inkscape operations, selecting has, by far, the greatest number of methods,
tools, dialogs, and shortcuts available. You need to know
a good portion of them to be able to work efficiently—and at least a few to be
able to work in Inkscape at all.</p>
			<p>By itself, selecting or deselecting objects does not change the document in any way. Therefore, none
of the techniques described in this chapter are undoable actions, and none require your
document to be saved.</p>
			<a id="section5.1"/><h2>5.1 The Selection Cue</h2>
			<p>
				As you probably know by now, Inkscape's selection is just a list of objects, which
may include anything—from no objects (empty selection, nothing selected) to all the objects in
the document. Selection is local to the editing window; if you open a second window with
the same document (<a href="c03.xhtml#section3.6">3.6</a>), that window will have its own independent list of selected
objects.  Selected objects can be anywhere on the canvas, in any layer or group;
multiple selected objects don't have to be <a id="78"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_78" title="78"/>children of the same parent. The only thing 
you <em>cannot</em> do is select an object and its ancestor at the same time (<a href="#section5.10">5.10</a>).</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						Even hidden or locked objects can be included in the selection. While most tools will refuse to select a hidden or locked object directly, it is still
possible, for example, by using the XML Editor (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.10">4.10</a>).</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				On the canvas, each selected object is marked by the selection cue. By
default, this cue is a dashed frame around an object, showing that object's
bounding box (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.3">4.3</a>). This frame is drawn on top of all objects using a contrasting color,
so it is visible on any background.</p>
			<p>
				You can switch to a different selection cue: a small diamond-shaped
mark in the bottom left corner of each object's bounding box, as shown in <a href="#fig5-1">Figure 5-1</a>.
To change the type of the selection cue or to turn it off
altogether, go to the <span class="ui"><strong>Tools<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Selector</strong></span> subpage of the <span class="ui"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> dialog.</p>
			<a id="fig5-1"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="06/selcue.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 5-1: The two possible types of selection cues</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Also, you can control which tools display the selection cue and which do not. For
this, look for checkboxes labeled <span class="ui">Show selection cue</span> on each tool's 
page in the<span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog. By default, every tool shows the selection cue, except
for the Measure, Eraser, Tweak, Calligraphy, and Paint bucket tools—that is, those tools where the cue is not very useful or may be a distraction. (Of course, the
selection is still there whether the cue is displayed or not—it remains the same no
matter how you switch tools.)</p>
			<a id="section5.2"/><h2>5.2 Selection and the Status Bar</h2>
			<p>
				A lot of things happen throughout the program when you select or deselect 
objects. Inkscape instantly redirects all its attention to the new selection. It
redraws the selection cues, scrolls the canvas if necessary to show the selected objects 
(<a href="c03.xhtml#section3.12">3.12</a>), and updates various displays and indicators all over the interface.</p>
			<p>
				One of the most important sources of hints in Inkscape, the status bar, displays as
much information about a selection as would reasonably fit into it. For a
single selected object, it tells you the type of object, lists certain additional properties
for some of the types (such as the number of nodes for paths, font family and size for text objects), 
names the layer in which this object resides, and gives some useful advice, as shown in <a href="#fig5-2">Figure 5-2</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig5-2"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="06/statusbar-single.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 5-2: Status bar: a single selected object</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="79"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_79" title="79"/>For multiple selected objects, Inkscape tells you how many are selected and lists their types (<a href="#fig5-3">Figure 5-3</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig5-3"/>
			<figure>
				<img alt="" src="06/statusbar-multiple.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 5-3: Status bar: multiple
selected objects</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				If objects in more than one layer are selected, Inkscape gives you the number of objects and their layers along with the object types (<a href="#fig5-4">Figure 5-4</a>).</p>
				<a id="fig5-4"/>
				<figure>
				<img alt="" src="06/statusbar-multiple-layers.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 5-4: Status bar: multiple
selected objects of multiple types in multiple layers</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				To the left of the status bar message area is the current layer
indicator (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.9.3">4.9.3</a>). Since selected objects can be in different layers, this widget is not directly
connected to the selection. However, when you select a single object by clicking, Inkscape assumes
that you now want to work in that object's layer—so it makes that layer current, which
the indicator reflects.</p>
			<p>
				Further to the left is the <em>selected style indicator</em>, which always reflects
the style of the current selection (if many objects with different styles are selected,
it displays their averaged style or says "Different" if the styles cannot be averaged). I discuss this important widget in 
detail in <a href="c08.xhtml#section8.2">8.2</a>.</p>
			<a id="section5.3"/><h2>5.3 Subselection</h2>
			<p>
				Some tools allow a finer-grained type of selection so as to
work on part of a selected object rather than an entire object.
This selected part of a selected object is sometimes called the <em>subselection</em>.</p>
			<p>
				One example is the Text tool. You can select an entire text object, but then you can
select a <em>fragment</em> of text inside that object by using Shift with arrow keys,
or by dragging with the mouse, just like you do in a text editor (<a href="c15.xhtml#section15.1.1">15.1.1</a>). That selected part of the
text is the text subselection.</p>
			<p>
				Another example is the Gradient tool. A gradient can have many stops (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.5">10.5</a>),
and the tool can select one or more of those stops at a time. Naturally, gradient stops are visible only 
for selected objects—so if you select a stop, you're creating a subselection within
the regular object selection.</p>
			<p>
				When you change subselection, some things in Inkscape behave the same as when you
change selection. In particular, the selected style indicator in the status bar 
(<a href="c08.xhtml#fig8-2">Figure 8-2</a>) displays the
style of the subselection—that is, the style of the selected text fragment and not the
entire text, or the style of the selected gradient stop and not the entire object. Also,
any style-setting commands (such as clicking a color on the palette, or pasting a style by pressing
Shift-Ctrl-V) will apply to the subselection if it is present. In other words,
subselection allows you to deal with parts of your objects almost as though they were
objects in their own right.</p>
			<a id="section5.4"/><h2>
				5.4 <a id="80"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_80" title="80"/>Selecting by Clicking: the Selector</h2>
			<p>You may know already that the topmost tool in the toolbar is the Selector and
that clicking an object with that tool selects that object. Of course, there is much
more to the Selector tool than that, but let's look at this simple action in more
detail.</p>
			<p>
				First, note that clicking an object <em>deselects</em> any previous selection. Also,
with the Selector tool, you can not only select objects but also <em>drag</em> the selected
objects in any direction. Combined, these two features make it easy and
natural to move objects around—almost without thinking about "selection" at all. You
see an object, you click and drag it to where you want it. The click selects it,
deselecting anything else, and the drag moves it.</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes, this behavior can be annoying. Especially if you use a tablet with a pen instead of a mouse,
you may find it too easy to nudge an object accidentally when
all you wanted to do was to select it by clicking. To make this less of a problem,
go to the <span class="ui"><strong>Input/Output<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Input Devices</strong></span> page of the <span class="ui"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> dialog and adjust the<span class="ui"><strong>Click/drag threshold</strong></span> value. This is the allowed "slippage" of the mouse,
the default being 4 screen pixels; if you click and drag an object by less than this many pixels, your
action is still considered a click and the object does not move. Increase this
value if you often end up accidentally moving objects instead of clicking them;
conversely, decrease it if you find that objects annoyingly "stick" more than you like
when you really want to move them.</p>
			<p>Before you click anything, however, you want to be sure that you're clicking in the
right place and that your click will not be wasted. Inkscape tries to be helpful: it
changes your mouse cursor, by appending a cross-with-arrows icon to it, 
when you are over a clickable area of an object—as opposed to
an empty canvas where the cursor is a plain arrow.</p>
			<p>
				Play with this cursor-changing capability a little. You will discover that objects
with no fill cannot be selected by clicking inside them and that fully transparent
objects are not selectable by clicking at all (although you can select them with the rubber band, as
you'll see in the next section). In Outline mode (<a href="c03.xhtml#section3.14">3.14</a>), you can select an object only
by clicking its outline.</p>
			<p>
				As you can imagine, this changing cursor is less helpful in complex 
drawings where the entire canvas is often covered with objects. However, if you separate
background objects into a layer and lock that layer (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.9">4.9</a>), those 
objects, now unselectable, will no longer change the cursor—so you can again sense
the foreground objects by moving your mouse over them.</p>
			<p>Also, you will notice that every clickable object has an invisible margin several
pixels wide on all sides. Clicking in that margin still selects the
object. This is handy for selecting small objects that would otherwise be almost
impossible to click upon accurately. On the downside, this also explains why it's sometimes
difficult to select the bottom object in a stack even if that bottom object protrudes
a little from under the top one.</p>
			<p>
				If you don't like the size of this clickable margin, you can change it on the<span class="ui">Input/Output<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Input Devices</span> page of the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog.
This is the <span class="ui">Grab sensitivity</span>
value, the default being 8 screen pixels. Note that both this value and the<span class="ui">Click/drag threshold</span> are in screen pixels, which means they do not
depend on <a id="81"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_81" title="81"/>zoom; of course, you will find it easier to
perform small moves and select small objects when you're zoomed in.</p>
			<a id="section5.5"/><h2>5.5 Selecting by Clicking: Other Tools</h2>
			<p>One of the principles of Inkscape's user interface is consistency.
Unless there's a reason to do otherwise, all tools and modes strive to behave the same.
This means that many tools, just like the Selector, can select an object by
clicking it.</p>
			<p>
				Clicking to select works in the following tools: Node (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5">12.5</a>), all of the
shape tools (<a href="c11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>), Text (<a href="c15.xhtml#ch15">Chapter 15</a>), Connector (<a href="c01.xhtml#section1.2">1.2</a>), Gradient (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.1">10.1</a>), and Mesh (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.7">10.7</a>) tools. The
tools that <em>cannot</em> select by clicking are different for a reason—in those tools,
a single click is reserved for a different function specific to that tool.</p>
			<p>
				Unlike the Selector, all these tools directly select individual objects even
when they are inside groups (in
other words, in these tools a simple click is equivalent to Ctrl-click in
Selector, <a href="#section5.10">5.10</a>). This makes sense; all of these tools work on individual objects of
various types, so in most cases, selecting a group is not what you really want to do. For
example, if you select a group with the Node tool, you would not be able to do anything useful
with it—a group has no path nodes to edit. That's why this tool always directly selects
the <em>path</em> you clicked, whether it's grouped or not.</p>
			<p>
				Also, unlike the Selector, other tools don't change the cursor over selectable
objects. The only exception is the Text tool that switches to the text insertion cursor
when over an editable text object (<a href="c15.xhtml#section15.1">15.1</a>).</p>
			<a id="section5.6"/><h2>5.6 Adding to a Selection</h2>
			<p>A selection can contain more than one object.
If you’ve already made the effort to select some objects, and then want to select some other objects as well, can you do so
without starting the selection all over again?</p>
			<p>
				To <em>add</em> another object to the current selection, Shift-click
it. Conversely, if you Shift-click an already selected object, it will be<em>removed</em> from selection. This shortcut works as a toggle that
inverts the selected status of the object that you Shift-click.</p>
			<a id="section5.7"/><h2>5.7 Selecting with the Rubber Band</h2>
			<p>
				Another way to select multiple objects in the Selector is by dragging <em>around</em> them.
Imagine a rectangle surrounding all the objects you want to select and drag from one
corner of that rectangle to the opposite corner. (The exact direction of the drag—top left to bottom right versus top right to bottom left, for example—does not matter.)
This rectangle (shown in <a href="#fig5-5">Figure 5-5</a>), which is visible while you're dragging, is called the <em>rubber band</em> or <em>marquee</em>.</p>
			<a id="fig5-5"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="06/marquee2.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 5-5: Using the rubber band (mouse drag) to select multiple
objects</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Selecting by rubber band is <em>not a toggle</em>; once you start a new rubber band, any
previous selection is deselected. This is why, logically, single-clicking on empty
space (not an object) deselects anything—it's just a zero-sized
rubber band that deselects the old selection without creating a new one.</p>
			<p><a id="82"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_82" title="82"/>The rubber band selects fully enclosed objects in all visible and unlocked layers—in other words, across
the z-order stack of the entire document, not the current layer only. (For this reason,
selecting by rubber band does not change the current layer, even if it resulted in selecting
a single object in a layer different from the current one.) Also, the rubber band 
selects those objects that you cannot select by clicking—those that are
underneath others, those without fill and stroke, and those that are fully
transparent (have zero opacity). However, objects that are hidden or locked (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.1">4.1</a>)
still cannot be selected.</p>
			<p>
				In short, if an object's bounding box is completely inside the rubber band rectangle and
that object is at all selectable, it <em>will</em> get selected.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="box">
					<h2>Rubber Band Behavior</h2>
					<p>
						In Adobe Illustrator, the rubber band works differently. It selects all
objects whose bounding box lies within <em>or intersects</em> its rectangle. Inkscape's default
behavior—selecting only what is <em>completely</em> inside the rubber band—matches that of the CorelDRAW
and Xara vector editors.</p>
					<p>
						Inkscape also can emulate Adobe Illustrator's selection behavior.
Press the <span class="ui"><strong>Toggle selection box to select all touched objects</strong></span> button on the Selector's controls bar (fourth from left)
to change the selection rubber band's behavior. In this mode, the rubber band is shown as a red dashed line.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				It's tempting to assume that, as with clicking, dragging the rubber band with
Shift would give you a toggle behavior. This is not quite the case,
however.  Shift-dragging with the Selector tool works like simple dragging
except that it <em>always</em> creates a rubber band, even if you start from an object and not from an
empty canvas, and <em>then</em> adds (not toggles) enclosed objects to selection.
Without Shift, dragging from a (selectable) object will select and
move that object, but pressing Shift and dragging <em>forces</em> the rubber band—which makes
it a lot more useful in complex drawings where empty canvas may be hard to come by.</p>
			<a id="section5.8"/><h2>
				5.8 <a id="83"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_83" title="83"/>Touch Selection</h2>
			<p>
				Touch selection is a close relative of the rubber band. In the Selector tool, 
with no previous selection, drag
from an empty canvas with Alt. You will see a red trail left by your mouse
cursor—the <em>touch path</em>. After you release mouse button,
all objects <em>touched by</em> (not included in) this trail will become
selected (<a href="#fig5-6">Figure 5-6</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig5-6"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="06/touchsel.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 5-6: Using touch selection (Alt-drag). Objects that will
be selected after you release the mouse are marked with darker gray.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>This means you can literally "paint" over the objects you want to select, which is convenient
when the objects you need are close together but their bounding boxes are too big
(or too intertwined with other objects) to use the rubber band.</p>
			<p>Unlike the rubber band, touch selection does not select completely transparent
objects or those obscured by others—that is, objects that you cannot really "touch."
In fact, touch selection behaves exactly as if it were a series of
Shift-clicks along the touch path so that each touched object gets one such click.</p>
			<p>
				If there is a selection, Alt-drag has a different function: it
moves the selection regardless of where you drag (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.1">6.1</a>).  What if you already have
something selected and want to <em>add</em> to it with touch selection? Use
Shift-Alt-drag: just like Shift forces
the rubber band even if you start from an object, with touch selection, it forces the touch path
even if you have a previous selection. The touched objects are then <em>added</em> to
the selection.</p>
			<p>
				If you touch-select objects so you can then delete them, the
Delete mode of the Eraser tool (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.4">14.4</a>) performs both functions at once: drag over
objects, and they'll be deleted once you release the mouse. You don't need
to hold Alt in the Eraser tool.</p>
			<a id="section5.9"/><h2>5.9 Selecting Objects from Underneath</h2>
			<p>One of the common problems with selecting objects in complex drawings is that
some objects obscure others. Even if the top object is partially transparent and you can
see another object underneath, simply clicking it will still select the
top object.</p>
			<p>If the bounding box of the bottom object is smaller than that of the top one, you can
Shift-drag a rubber band around the small bottom object, and this will select it without
selecting the top object. However, this is not always possible.</p>
			<a id="section5.9.1"/><h3>
				5.9.1 <a id="84"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_84" title="84"/>Alt-click</h3>
			<p>
				To select objects that aren’t at the top of the z-order, use Alt-click, which <em>selects under</em>
the currently selected object. This
means that the result of an Alt-click depends on the current selection; if
nothing is selected, or if you Alt-click outside the current selection, the result is
the same as if you simply clicked without Alt.</p>
			<p>If, however, you click a selected object and there are other objects underneath
it, Alt-click will deselect the selected object and instead select the object
immediately beneath it. The next Alt-click will select a still deeper object,
and so on. When you reach the bottommost object at the click point, the next
Alt-click again selects the topmost one.</p>
			<p>Imagine you have three stacked objects, numbered 1, 2, 3, from bottom to
top. With nothing selected, Alt-clicking them selects the topmost one, 3. The next Alt-click
selects 2, then 1, then 3 again, and so on.</p>
			<p>Shift-Alt-click differs from Alt-click in the same way
that Shift-click differs from a simple click: it adds to the
selection or removes from it without unselecting it completely. So, in our 1, 2, 3 stack
of objects, the first Shift-Alt-click selects 3; after another
Shift-Alt-click, you will have 2 and 3 selected; one more
Shift-Alt-click adds the bottommost object to the selection as well. So, after
three Shift-Alt-clicks, you will have 1, 2, and 3 all selected.
Further Shift-Alt-clicks will toggle the selected status of 3 while keeping 1 and 2 selected.</p>
			<a id="section5.9.2"/><h3>
				5.9.2 Alt-scroll <span class="NoteHead">[1.1]</span></h3>
			<p>If you have a mouse with a scroll wheel, there’s another way to select underneath an object.  Rotating the wheel with Alt selects objects in the stack under the mouse cursor, one by one in turn, one object per notch. Rotating forward goes from top to bottom in the stack; rotating backward goes from bottom to top. Thus, in the 1-2-3 stack example from the previous section, Alt-scrolling forward over it will select objects in the order 3, 2, 1, 3, 2,... and Alt-scrolling backward will select 1, 2, 3, 1, 2,....</p>
			<p>
				To make this even more intuitive, Inkscape temporarily adjusts the opacity of all the objects in the stack
while you Alt-scroll, overriding any opacity they might naturally have (<a href="#fig5-7">Figure 5-7</a>).
Once you start rotating, all the objects in the stack become semitransparent, except for the newly selected object, 
which becomes fully opaque. This way, you can see at once where in the stack you are and how much 
you need to scroll to get to the object you need.</p>
			<a id="fig5-7"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="06/alt-scroll.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 5-7: Using Alt-scroll wheel (rotating forward) to select one from a stack of objects</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="85"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_85" title="85"/>If you add Shift to Alt-scrolling, Inkscape will no longer deselect the object it had selected
at the previous notch of wheel rotation. This way, you can add the entire stack of objects under the cursor
simply by pressing Shift-Alt and rotating all the way up or down until you exhaust the stack.
This is more convenient than Shift-Alt-clicking because there's no back-and-forth toggling of the top object
once you reach the bottom.</p>
			<p>Another difference between Alt-clicking and Alt-scrolling is that the latter ignores grouping and always selects
individual objects, whether they are grouped or not. To do the same with clicking, you will need to add the Ctrl key to the mix,
as you will see in the next section.</p>
			<a id="section5.10"/><h2>5.10 Selecting  in Groups</h2>
			<p>Grouping is a boon when you want to treat a collection of objects as a
whole: simply click any object in a group (with the Selector tool) and the entire group gets
selected. However, quite often you want to select and edit an object inside a group
without ungrouping it. For this, simply Ctrl-click an
object in a group.</p>
			<p>
				Ctrl-clicking  ignores <em>any</em> grouping, no matter how many
levels deep it is. For example, if object A is a member of group B, which, in turn, is
a member of top-level group C, then Ctrl-clicking A will select A, cutting
right through both levels of grouping. There's no way to select group B by
Ctrl-clicking—it will always select the lowest-level nongroup object.</p>
			<p>
				The only way to select group B, which is inside group C, is by <em>entering</em>
group C (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.9.1">4.9.1</a>). Entering C makes it a temporary layer. Once in that layer, you can select
B with a simple click.</p>
			<p>You can combine Ctrl-click with Alt (select
under). Logically, Ctrl-Alt-click does the same thing as Alt-click,
except that it disregards any grouping and browses through the z-order stack of objects
at the click point as if they were all ungrouped. (As for Alt-scrolling, it already
disregards grouping, so adding Ctrl to it has no effect.)</p>
			<p>Similarly, you can combine Ctrl-click with Shift to add an
object to selection or remove it from selection. Finally, you can
Shift-Ctrl-Alt-click, which means "Add to selection the topmost nonselected
object in the z-order stack at this point, ignoring grouping; if all objects at this point are
selected, deselect the topmost one."</p>
			<p>The only limit to the power of selecting by clicking with various modifiers is
that you cannot have both an object and a group that contains that object selected at the same time. So, for
example, if you Ctrl-click an object inside a group and then
Shift-click (without Ctrl!) another object of the same group, thus
trying to add the group to the selection, the group becomes selected, but the first
selected object is deselected. Having both a group and an object inside that
group selected at the same time would lead to all kinds of paradoxes,
so Inkscape does its best to prevent this from happening.</p>
			<a id="section5.11"/><h2>
				5.11 <a id="86"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_86" title="86"/>Selecting with Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
			<p>
				Generally, selecting is a task for a mouse or pen—because, in most cases, it is done by
indicating some points or areas on the screen. However, you can also use keyboard shortcuts
for two very common selection operations: selecting the <em>next</em> or <em>previous
object</em> (Tab or Shift-Tab) and selecting <em>all objects</em>
(Ctrl-A).</p>
			<p>
				Here, <em>next</em> and <em>previous</em> actually refer to the z-order of objects inside
the document (see <a href="c04.xhtml#section4.4">4.4</a>). When you press Tab, you select the object immediately<em>above</em> the currently selected object in the z-order (or above the topmost selected object, if
several objects are selected). Correspondingly, Shift-Tab selects the object
immediately <em>below</em> the (bottommost) selected object.</p>
			<p>If nothing is selected, Tab selects the bottommost object in the current
layer, and Shift-Tab selects the topmost one. Since objects are typically
added to the top of the current layer's z-order, pressing Shift-Tab with no
previous selection is therefore a convenient shortcut for selecting the most recently
added (drawn, pasted, imported) object.</p>
			<p>
				You can change some aspects of this behavior on the<span class="ui">Behavior<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Selecting</span> page of the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog (<a href="#fig5-8">Figure 5-8</a>).</p>

					By default, these keys are limited to the current layer (which may be a group
that you have entered, <a href="c04.xhtml#section4.9.1">4.9.1</a>). That is, once you reach the topmost object of the layer
by pressing Tab, another Tab takes you back to the bottommost object in the same layer; pressing
Ctrl-A selects all objects only in the current layer. The <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog describes this behavior
as <span class="ui">Select only within current layer</span>.
The <span class="ui">Select in current layer and sublayers</span> option works the same except 
it enters inside the sublayers of the current layer (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.9.1">4.9.1</a>), and <span class="ui">Select in all
layers</span> allows Tab or Shift-Tab to cross the boundaries of layers
and Ctrl-A to select all objects in the entire document. Another way to select all objects
in all layers, regardless of preferences, is by pressing Ctrl-Alt-A.</li>
				<li><a id="87"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_87" title="87"/>You can uncheck the two checkboxes, <span class="ui">Ignore hidden objects and layers</span> and <span class="ui">Ignore locked objects and layers</span>,
to allow the keyboard shortcuts to select those objects that are hidden or locked.
If you also choose <span class="ui">Select in all layers</span>, you will be able to reach inside a hidden or locked layer
(<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.9">4.9</a>).</li>

				5.12 Selecting by Properties <span class="NoteHead">[1.1]</span></h2>
			<p>
				A number of commands in the <span class="ui">Edit<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Select Same</span> menu let you select all objects in the document that
are the same—according to some parameter—as the currently selected object. For the selection criteria, you can use
the same fill color, the same stroke color, both fill and stroke color, stroke style (including color, width, dash pattern, <a href="c09.xhtml#ch9">Chapter 9</a>), or the
object type (rectangle, text, group, and so on).</p>
			<a id="section5.13"/><h2>5.13 Selecting by Searching</h2>
			<p>
				Searching for objects is typically only needed in complex documents—but when you
do need it, you'll be glad Inkscape can do it. This chapter on selection is the best
place to discuss searching simply because it is, in essence, yet another way to select objects.
Even though Inkscape's <span class="ui">Find/Replace</span> dialog can do replacing (that is, modifying) 
as well as searching, you still need to search (that is, select) before you can replace.</p>
			<p>
				To open the <span class="ui">Find/Replace</span> dialog (<a href="#fig5-9">Figure 5-9</a>), press Ctrl-F or
use <span class="ui"><strong>Edit<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Find/Replace</strong></span> from the menu.</p>
			<a id="fig5-9"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="06/find.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 5-9: The <span class="ui">Find/Replace</span> dialog</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				To search, type your query in the <span class="ui"><strong>Find</strong></span> field, check the options, then click <span class="ui"><strong>Find</strong></span>.</p>
			<p>
				Choosing the <span class="ui">Text</span> option applies only to text objects (<a href="c15.xhtml#ch15">Chapter 15</a>) by searching
within their text content. Otherwise, you can search in the <span class="ui">Properties</span> (detailed
below) of all kinds of objects.</p>
			<p>
				Default search includes all of the document; you can limit it to the <span class="ui">Current layer</span> or to <span class="ui">Selection</span>. The latter
option is useful for a multistage search—for example, if you want to find text objects that contain both
"day" and "night", search for "day" first and then search for "night" within the selection.</p>
			<p>
				Search can be <span class="ui">Case sensitive</span> (off by default) or require <span class="ui">Exact match</span> (by default, partial matches
will be selected too, such as a text object with the word "selected" when you search for "select").</p>
			<p>
				You can choose to apply search to objects that are <span class="ui">hidden</span> and/or <span class="ui">locked</span> (individually or by being
in hidden/locked layers).</p>
			<p>
				You can search in the <span class="ui">ID</span> attributes of all objects (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.1">4.1</a>), which are unique for each SVG element  (though not very meaningful, unless you edit them yourself).</p>
			<p>
				You can also search within the <span class="ui">Style</span> of
objects. As this is a simple text field, to use this feature, you need
to have at least some idea of how style is encoded in SVG (see <a href="b01.xhtml#sectionA.8">A.8</a>).
When in doubt, you can always check the <code>style</code> attribute of an object
in the XML Editor (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.10">4.10</a>). Here are a few
examples:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Finding all red-filled objects</dt>
				<dd>
					This is possible, but only for one specific
red color. You need to know how to convert that color to the RRGGBB form. Hovering
your mouse over a color  on the palette (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.5">8.5</a>) in the selected style indicator (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.6">8.6</a>)
will give you <a id="88"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_88" title="88"/>the color's RRGGBB in the tool tip. 
For example, if you're searching for the bright red fill (<code>#ff0000</code>), in
an object's style string the color is preceded by the name of the
property, <code>fill</code>, separated by a colon. So your search string will be<code>fill:#ff0000</code>.
				</dd>
				<dt>Finding all objects without stroke or fill</dt>
				<dd>
					Search for <code>stroke:none</code> or <code>fill:none</code>.
				</dd>
				<dt>Finding all fully transparent objects</dt>
				<dd>
					Search for <code>opacity:0;</code>
(note the separator semicolon at the end; without it, it will also find all<em>partially</em> transparent objects—for example, those with <code>opacity:0.5;</code>
in their style).
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>
				Separately, you can search text objects by the name of the <span class="ui">font</span> they use (even though it's usually
also in the <code>style</code> attribute).</p>
			<p>
				More generally, you can search for a string in the <span class="ui">value</span> or <span class="ui">name</span> of any attribute. For example, all objects that you export to bitmap using selection export get the attribute<code>inkscape:export-filename</code>, which stores the filename of the bitmap export
file. So searching for this attribute will select all objects in the document that were
ever exported (following which you can, for example, export them all again, see <a href="c18.xhtml#section18.6">18.6</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Finally, you can limit your search to specific <span class="ui">Object types</span>: uncheck the default <span class="ui"><strong>All types</strong></span>
and select which types you are interested in.</p>
			<a id="section5.14"/><h2>
				5.14 <a id="89"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_89" title="89"/>Following Links</h2>
			<p>As you will see in the following chapters, objects in Inkscape can be linked to each
other in various ways. You will often want to follow such links to find the object to
which your current selected object is linked. Inkscape has a universal keyboard shortcut
for this, Shift-D. Depending on what kind of object is selected, pressing
Shift-D will select:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The original of a clone (<a href="c16.xhtml#section16.4">16.4</a>), if a clone is selected.</li>
				<li>
					The path to which the selected text-on-path object is attached  (<a href="c15.xhtml#section15.2.4">15.2.4</a>).</li>
				<li>
					The path to which the selected linked offset object is attached
(<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.4">12.4</a>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Some document objects may be stored in the<code>defs</code> (see <a href="b01.xhtml#sectionA.4">A.4</a>), in which case, you can reference them from the document, but
they are not visible anywhere on the canvas. If your onscreen clone, text-on-path, or linked
offset refers to an object in <code>defs</code>, Shift-D will fail with an
error message in the status bar.</p>
			<a id="section5.15"/><h2>5.15 Deselecting and Inverting</h2>
			<p>In almost any tool, context, or mode, pressing Escape will deselect the current
selection. If you have a subselection, typically pressing Escape once will
deselect the subselection and the second Escape will deselect the
regular selection.</p>
			<p>
				Another way to deselect is by clicking the empty canvas (or a locked
object with nothing underneath it). This, however, works only in Selector and in those
tools where a simple click selects objects (<a href="#section5.5">5.5</a>). In complex drawings where accessing empty canvas may be
difficult, Escape is by far the most convenient way to deselect.</p>
			<p>
				Also, by default Inkscape deselects when you switch the current layer (see <a href="c04.xhtml#section4.9">4.9</a>). 
You can disable this on the <span class="ui">Behavior<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Selecting</span> page of the <span class="ui">Preferences</span>
dialog.</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes, it's easier to identify things you do <em>not</em> want to select. Inkscape makes
this easy—just select the objects you don't need and do <span class="ui"><strong>Edit<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Invert Selection</strong></span>.
What was selected loses selection; what wasn't selected (within the current layer)
becomes selected.</p>
			<a id="section5.16"/><h2>5.16 Selection Miscellany</h2>
			<p>
				When you undo an action, your current
selection is usually (but not always) deselected; whether this happens depends on what kind of action
you're undoing.  A similar problem is that selection is often lost after an extension
(<a href="c19.xhtml#ch19">Chapter 19</a>) is run. Moreover, if an extension opens a configuration dialog 
and you check the <span class="ui">Live preview</span> checkbox in it, you cannot
change selection (or do anything else on the canvas) while that dialog is open.</p>
			<p>
				Inkscape's powerful command line interface has a special parameter for
selecting objects, <code>--select</code> (<a href="b03.xhtml#sectionC.6">C.6</a>). To use it, you need to know the IDs of the
objects you want to select. This makes it possible to script fully automated Inkscape
editing sessions where a single command loads a document, selects some objects, performs
some actions on them, saves the document, and quits—all without any user interaction.</p>

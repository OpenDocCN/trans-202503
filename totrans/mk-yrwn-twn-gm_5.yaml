    little weird? Don’t worry—that’s normal. Maybe you don’t *feel* like a game designer
    yet. That’s normal too.

    there are so many different ways to be a game designer. For example, game designers
    can be people who work at big companies where everyone makes small contributions
    to a product. Game designers can also be people who sit in their bedrooms making
    things that they find fun.

    and then wonder, “What if we have to toss the ball under our leg?” or “What if
    we’re not allowed to touch the ball with our hands?” There are a million-and-a-half
    different ways to be a game designer.

    cool fact about game design: if you’re doing it right, it should *always* remain
    a mystery to you. Even the people who’ve designed games for years are still asking
    questions about what games could be. “What if you can only move one space every
    day?” “What kind of game can you play at a protest?” “Why don’t games let you
    make friends with the monsters instead of fighting them?”'

    overall shape of your Twine blueprint first by creating passages before writing
    in them. Then go back and fill in the passages to create a story. Let the shape
    of the story guide what you write! What would be in a Twine game shaped like a
    heart? Or a star? How would the passages connect?

    need to tell the reader to turn to page 4 or page 15\. How would your story be
    different when someone is holding it in their hands instead of playing it on a
    computer? What can you do on paper that’s hard to do on the computer?

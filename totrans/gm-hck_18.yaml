    edition* (No Starch Press, 2010) is a wonderful book that can teach you everything
    there is to know about assembly.[2](ch04.xhtml#ch00fn_02). Each command must fit
    within 15 bytes. Most commands are 6 or fewer.[3](ch04.xhtml#ch00fn_03). There
    is also an unsigned multiplication instruction, `MUL`, which only works with a
    single operand.[4](ch04.xhtml#ch00fn_04). Just as `MUL` is to `IMUL`, `DIV` is
    the unsigned counterpart to `IDIV`.'

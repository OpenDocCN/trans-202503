- en: When Android met with Google, Larry Page observed that it would make sense for
    Google to acquire the small company, to help them build a platform that would
    enable Google to enter the mobile market.

  zh: 当Android团队与Google会面时，拉里·佩奇观察到，Google收购这家小公司是合乎逻辑的，这将帮助他们构建一个平台，使Google能够进入移动市场。
- en: 'While both parties agreed in principle, there were many details to be ironed
    out. Nick recalled two large issues that Android needed to resolve with Google.
    The first was money: they needed to agree on the valuation of the company and
    how they would be paid, both initially and in ongoing milestone payments after
    the team joined. The second issue was commitment: Android wanted to make sure
    that they would actually get to accomplish the original goal and not just get
    sucked up into the larger company and forgotten. They needed Google to agree to
    support Android’s efforts after the acquisition and provide internal support on
    an ongoing basis.'

  zh: 尽管双方原则上达成了共识，但仍有许多细节需要解决。Nick回忆起Android需要与Google解决的两个大问题。第一个是资金问题：他们需要就公司的估值和支付方式达成一致，包括初始支付和团队加入后持续的里程碑支付。第二个问题是承诺：Android希望确保他们能够真正实现最初的目标，而不是被吞并进更大的公司后被遗忘。他们需要Google承诺，在收购后继续支持Android的努力，并提供持续的内部支持。
- en: 'The negotiations began in the Spring of 2005\. But Rich Miner had a problem:
    a family vacation conflicted with these time-sensitive meetings. He ended up doing
    both in parallel, calling in to the meetings from a sailboat in the British Virgin
    Islands. “I had to find ports that had mobile phone coverage. I’d have to have
    the boat with everybody off on the beach enjoying themselves during these two-hour
    negotiation phone calls.'

  zh: 谈判始于2005年春季。但Rich Miner遇到了一个问题：一次家庭度假与这些时间紧迫的会议发生了冲突。他最终将两者同时进行，从英国维尔京群岛的一艘帆船上参加会议。“我必须找到有手机信号的港口。在这两个小时的电话会议期间，我得让所有人都上岸去海滩享受时光，只有我一个人在船上。”
- en: “One of the things we were concerned about was, ‘This isn’t strategic to Google.
    You guys haven’t even started focusing on WAP^([1](#c05-footnote-1)) or any mobile
    stuff. We think this is going to be a lot of work, require resources. What happens
    if you don’t want to do this? How do we know we’re going to get the resources
    we need to be successful?’”

- en: 'Larry Page suggested they go talk with Jonathan Rosenberg, a Google executive
    in charge of product and marketing. Rich remembered his advice: “‘Google’s different
    from other companies. A lot of other companies, when projects aren’t going well,
    they throw a lot of resources at it. At Google, we like to give resources to things
    that are going well. So if you do what you’re going to do and you’re executing,
    you’ll get more resources.’ That was, in essence, his Leap of Faith talk; why
    we should, if we believe in ourselves, do this because we’ll get the resources
    if we’re executing.”'

  zh: 拉里·佩奇建议他们去与负责产品和市场的Google高管Jonathan Rosenberg谈谈。Rich记得他的建议：“‘Google与其他公司不同。很多公司，当项目进展不顺利时，他们会投入大量资源。而在Google，我们更愿意将资源投入到顺利进行的项目中。所以，如果你们按照计划执行，表现好，就会得到更多的资源。’这本质上就是他的信任跳跃演讲；如果我们相信自己，就应该做这件事，因为如果我们执行得好，就能获得资源。”

    the pitch deck. This time, it was at an internal meeting at Google, pitching to
    a group of executives. Andy and others were showing what this newly acquired team
    was planning to do. Swetland described the meeting: “We showed the demo we had.
    Andy was running through the deck. I remember when he got to the monetization
    thing, Larry cut him off and said ‘Don’t worry about that. I want you guys to
    build the best possible phone and we’ll figure out the rest later.’”'

    on it.

- en: When Android met with Google, Larry Page observed that it would make sense for
    Google to acquire the small company, to help them build a platform that would
    enable Google to enter the mobile market.

    out. Nick recalled two large issues that Android needed to resolve with Google.
    The first was money: they needed to agree on the valuation of the company and
    how they would be paid, both initially and in ongoing milestone payments after
    the team joined. The second issue was commitment: Android wanted to make sure
    that they would actually get to accomplish the original goal and not just get
    sucked up into the larger company and forgotten. They needed Google to agree to
    support Android’s efforts after the acquisition and provide internal support on
    an ongoing basis.'

    a family vacation conflicted with these time-sensitive meetings. He ended up doing
    both in parallel, calling in to the meetings from a sailboat in the British Virgin
    Islands. “I had to find ports that had mobile phone coverage. I’d have to have
    the boat with everybody off on the beach enjoying themselves during these two-hour
    negotiation phone calls.'

    You guys haven’t even started focusing on WAP^([1](#c05-footnote-1)) or any mobile
    stuff. We think this is going to be a lot of work, require resources. What happens
    if you don’t want to do this? How do we know we’re going to get the resources
    we need to be successful?’”

    in charge of product and marketing. Rich remembered his advice: “‘Google’s different
    from other companies. A lot of other companies, when projects aren’t going well,
    they throw a lot of resources at it. At Google, we like to give resources to things
    that are going well. So if you do what you’re going to do and you’re executing,
    you’ll get more resources.’ That was, in essence, his Leap of Faith talk; why
    we should, if we believe in ourselves, do this because we’ll get the resources
    if we’re executing.”'

    the pitch deck. This time, it was at an internal meeting at Google, pitching to
    a group of executives. Andy and others were showing what this newly acquired team
    was planning to do. Swetland described the meeting: “We showed the demo we had.
    Andy was running through the deck. I remember when he got to the monetization
    thing, Larry cut him off and said ‘Don’t worry about that. I want you guys to
    build the best possible phone and we’ll figure out the rest later.’”'

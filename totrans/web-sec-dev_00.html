<div class="image1"><img src="Images/common01.jpg" alt="image" width="190" height="190"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The web is a wild place. It’s easy to get the impression that the internet was designed very deliberately by experts and that everything works as it does for a good reason. In fact, the evolution of the internet has been rapid and haphazard, and the things we do on the network today go well beyond what the original inventors imagined.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As a result, securing your website can seem like a daunting proposition. Websites are a unique type of software that is available to millions of users immediately upon release, including an active and motivated community of hackers. Big companies routinely suffer security failures, and new data breaches are announced every week. How is a lone web developer supposed to protect themselves in the face of this?</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xx"/><strong>About This Book</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The big secret of web security is that the number of web vulnerabilities is actually rather small—coincidentally, about the size to fit in a single book—and these vulnerabilities don’t change much from year to year. This book you will teach you <em>every</em> key threat you need to know about, and I will break down the practical steps you should take to defend your website.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec2"><strong>Who Should Read This Book</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If you are a web developer who is just starting out in their career, this book is an ideal hitchhiker’s guide to security on the internet. Whether you have just finished a computer science qualification, are fresh out of bootcamp, or are self-taught, I recommend you read this book cover to cover. Everything in this book is essential knowledge, and it is explained in the most straightforward manner with clear examples. Preparing fully now for the threats you will face will save you a lot of trouble down the line.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you are a more experienced programmer, this book will prove useful too. You can always benefit from brushing up on your security knowledge, so use this book to fill in any gaps you may have. Treat it like a reference book and dip into the chapters that seem interesting. You don’t always know what you don’t know! Seasoned programmers like yourself have a responsibility to lead their team by example, and for web developers, that means following security best practices.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You will notice that this book isn’t specific to any particular programming language (though I make various security recommendations for the major languages as needed). A sound understanding of web security will benefit you, no matter which language you choose to program in. Many programmers will use a variety of languages across the course of their careers, so it’s better to learn the principles of web security than to focus too much on individual libraries.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec3"><strong>A Brief History of the Internet</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Before I lay out the contents of the book, it will be useful to recap how the internet arrived at its current state. A lot of clever engineers contributed to the explosive growth of the internet, but as with most software projects, security considerations often took a back seat while features were added. Understanding how security vulnerabilities crept in will give you the context you’ll need when learning how to fix them.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee while working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The research conducted at CERN consists of smashing subatomic particles together in the hope they will split into smaller subatomic particles, thus revealing the essential fabric of the universe, with the understanding that such research has the potential to create black holes right here on Earth.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxi"/>Berners-Lee, apparently less interested than his peers in bringing about an end to the universe, spent his time at CERN inventing the internet as we know it today, as a means of sharing data between universities about their findings. He created the first web browser and the first web server, and invented HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The world’s first website went online in 1993.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Early web pages were text-only. The first browser capable of displaying inline images was Mosaic, created at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. The creators of Mosaic eventually went on to join Netscape Communications, where they helped to create Netscape Navigator, the first widely used web browser. In the early web, most pages were static, and traffic was transmitted without encryption. A simpler time!</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec4"><strong><em>Scripting in the Browser</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Fast-forward to 1995, and a recent hire of Netscape Communications named Brendan Eich took 10 days to invent JavaScript, the first language capable of being embedded in web pages. During development, the language was called Mocha, then renamed LiveScript, then renamed again to JavaScript, before being eventually formalized as ECMAScript. Nobody liked the name ECMAScript, least of all Eich, who claimed it sounded like a skin disease; so everyone continued to call it JavaScript except in the most formal settings.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">JavaScript’s original incarnation combined the clumsy naming conventions of the (otherwise unrelated) Java programming language, the structured programming syntax of C, the obscure prototype-based inheritance of Self, and a nightmarish type-conversion logic of Eich’s own devising. For better or worse, JavaScript became the de facto language of web browsers. Suddenly, web pages were interactive things, and a whole class of security vulnerabilities emerged. Hackers found ways to inject JavaScript code into pages by using cross-site scripting attacks, and the internet became a much more dangerous place.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec5"><strong><em>A New Challenger Enters the Arena</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The first real competitor to Netscape Navigator was Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer had a couple of competitive advantages—it was free and came preinstalled on Microsoft Windows. Explorer rapidly became the world’s most popular browser, and the Explorer icon became “the internet button” for a generation of users learning how to navigate the web.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Microsoft’s attempts to “own” the web led it to introduce proprietary technology like ActiveX into the browser. Unfortunately, this led to an uptick in <em>malware</em>—malicious software that infects users’ machines. Windows was (and remains) the primary target for computer viruses, and the internet proved an effective delivery mechanism.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Internet Explorer’s dominance wouldn’t be challenged for many years, until the launch of Mozilla’s Firefox, and then by Chrome, a snazzy new browser created by the plucky young search startup Google. These newer browsers accelerated the growth and innovation in internet standards. However, by now, hacking was becoming a profitable business, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxii"/>any security flaws were being exploited as soon as they were discovered. Securing their browsers became a huge priority for vendors, and website owners had to keep on top of the latest security news if they wanted to protect their users.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec6"><strong><em>Machines for Writing HTML</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Web servers evolved at the same rapid clip as browser technology. In the first days of the internet, hosting websites was a niche hobby practiced by academics. Most universities ran the open source operating system Linux. In 1993, the Linux community implemented the <em>Common Gateway Interface (CGI)</em>, which allowed <em>webmasters</em> to easily create websites consisting of interlinked, static HTML pages.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">More interestingly, CGI allowed HTML to be generated by scripting languages like Perl or PHP—so a site owner could dynamically create pages from content stored in a database. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, back when the dream was that everyone would run their own web server, rather than uploading all their personal information to a social media behemoth with a questionable data-privacy policy.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">PHP popularized the notion of the <em>template</em> file: HTML with embedded processing tags, which could be fed through the PHP runtime engine. Dynamic PHP websites (like the earliest incarnations of Facebook) flourished across the internet. However, dynamic server code introduced a whole new category of security vulnerabilities. Hackers found novel ways to run their own malicious code on the server by using injection attacks, or to explore the server’s filesystem by using directory traversal.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec7"><strong><em>A Series of Tubes</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The constant reinvention of web technology means that much of today’s internet is powered by what we would consider “old” technology. Software tends to reach a point where it works enough to be useful, then falls into “maintenance” mode, where changes are made only if absolutely necessary. This is particularly true of web servers, which need to be online 24/7. Hackers scan the web for vulnerable sites running on older technology, since they frequently exhibit security holes. We are still fixing security issues first discovered a decade ago, which is why in this book I describe every major security flaw that can affect websites.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">At the same time, the internet continues to grow faster than ever! The trend for internet-enabling everyday devices like cars, doorbells, refrigerators, light bulbs, and cat-litter trays has opened a new vector for attacks. The simpler the appliance connecting to the Internet of Things, the less likely it is to have auto-updating security features. This has introduced huge numbers of unsecured internet nodes that provide a rich hosting environment for <em>botnets</em>, malicious software agents that can be installed and controlled remotely by hackers. This gives an attacker a lot of potential firepower if they target your site.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec8"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiii"/><strong><em>What to Worry About First</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A web developer can easily be discouraged by the difficulties involved with properly securing a website. You should have hope, though: an army of security researchers are out there bravely discovering, documenting, and fixing security flaws. The tools you need to secure your site are freely available and generally easy to use.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Learning about the most common security vulnerabilities, and knowing how to plug them, will protect your systems against 99 percent of attacks. There will always be ways for a very technical adversary to compromise your system, but unless you are running an Iranian nuclear reactor or a US political campaign, this thought shouldn’t keep you up at night.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec9"><strong>What’s in This Book</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindentb">The book is divided into two parts. <a href="part01.xhtml#part01">Part I</a> covers the nuts and bolts of how the internet works. <a href="part02.xhtml#part02">Part II</a> delves into specific vulnerabilities you need to protect against. The content is as follows:</p>&#13;
<p class="noindents"><strong><a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1: Let’s Hack a Website</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindents1">In this introductory chapter, you will learn how easy it is to hack a website. Hint: it’s really easy, so you did well to buy this book.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindents"><strong><a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2: How the Internet Works</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindents1">The “tubes” of the internet run on the Internet Protocol, a series of network technologies that allow computers across the world to communicate seamlessly. You will review TCP, IP addresses, domain names, and HTTP, and see how data can be passed securely on the network.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindents"><strong><a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3: How Browsers Work</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindents1">Users interact with your website via the browser, and many security vulnerabilities manifest there. You will learn how a browser renders a web page, and how JavaScript code is executed in the browser security model.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindents"><strong><a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4: How Web Servers Work</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindents1">Most of the code you will write for your website will run in a web server environment. Web servers are a primary target for hackers. This chapter describes how they serve static content, and how they use dynamic content like templates to incorporate data from databases and other systems. You will also dip into some of the major programming languages used for web programming, and review the security considerations of each.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindents"><strong><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5: How Programmers Work</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindents1">This chapter explains how you should go about the process of writing website code, and the good habits you can develop to reduce the risk of bugs and security vulnerabilities.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindents"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiv"/><strong><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06">Chapter 6: Injection Attacks</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindents1">We will begin our survey of website vulnerabilities by looking at one of the nastiest threats you will encounter: a hacker injecting code and executing it on your server. This often happens when your code interfaces with a SQL database or the operating system; or the attack might consist of remote code injected into the web server process itself. You will also see how file upload functions can allow a hacker to inject malicious scripts.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindents"><strong><a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7: Cross-Site Scripting Attacks</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindents1">This chapter reviews attacks used to smuggle malicious JavaScript code into the browser environment, and how to protect against them. There are three distinct methods of cross-site scripting (stored, reflected, and DOM-based), and you will learn how to protect against each.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindents"><strong><a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8: Cross-Site Request Forgery Attacks</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindents1">You will see how hackers use forgery attacks to trick your users into performing undesirable actions. This is a common nuisance on the internet, and you need to protect your users accordingly.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindents"><strong><a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9: Compromising Authentication</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindents1">If users sign up to your website, it’s essential that you treat their accounts securely. You will review various methods used by hackers to circumvent the login screen, from brute-force guessing of passwords to user enumeration. You will also review how to securely store user credentials in your database.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindents"><strong><a href="ch10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10: Session Hijacking</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindents1">You will see how your users can have their accounts hijacked <em>after</em> they have logged in. You will learn how to build your website and treat your cookies securely to mitigate this risk.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindents"><strong><a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11: Permissions</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindents1">Learn how you can prevent malicious actors from using privilege escalation to access forbidden areas of your site. In particular, if you reference files in your URLs, hackers will try to use directory traversal to explore your filesystem.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindents"><strong><a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12">Chapter 12: Information Leaks</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindents1">You might well be advertising vulnerabilities in your website by leaking information. This chapter tells you how to stop that immediately.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindents"><strong><a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13: Encryption</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindents1">This chapter shows how to properly use encryption and explains why it is important on the internet. Be prepared for some light mathematics.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindents"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxv"/><strong><a href="ch14.xhtml#ch14">Chapter 14: Third-Party Code</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindents1">You will learn how to manage vulnerabilities in other people’s code. Most of the code you run will be written by someone else, and you should know how to secure it!</p>&#13;
<p class="noindents"><strong><a href="ch15.xhtml#ch15">Chapter 15: XML Attacks</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindents1">Your web server probably parses XML, and could be vulnerable to the attacks described in this chapter. XML attacks have been a consistently popular attack vector among hackers for the past couple of decades, so beware!</p>&#13;
<p class="noindents"><strong><a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16">Chapter 16: Don’t Be an Accessory</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindents1">You might unwittingly be acting as an accessory to hacking attempts on others, as you will see in this chapter. Be a good internet citizen by making sure you close these security loopholes.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindents"><strong><a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17">Chapter 17: Denial-of-Service Attacks</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindents1">In this chapter, I will show you how massive amounts of network traffic can take your website offline as part of a denial-of-service attack.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindents"><strong><a href="ch18.xhtml#ch18">Chapter 18: Summing Up</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindents1">The last chapter is a cheat sheet that reviews the key elements of security you learned throughout the book, and recaps the high-level principles you should apply when being security-minded.

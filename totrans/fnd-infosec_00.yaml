- en: When I was in school, I was faced with a choice between pursuing a concentration
    in either information security or software engineering. The software engineering
    courses had terribly boring-sounding titles, so information security it was. Little
    did I know what a twisted and winding path I’d embarked on.

    years, I’ve dealt with large-scale malware outbreaks, collected forensic information
    for court cases, hunted for foreign hackers in computer systems, hacked into systems
    and applications (with permission!), pored over an astonishing amount of log data,
    implemented and maintained all manner of security tooling, authored many thousands
    of lines of code to fit square pegs into round holes, worked on open source projects,
    spoken at security conferences, taught classes, and written somewhere into the
    upper regions of hundreds of thousands of words on the topic of security.

    to anyone wondering what people mean when they use the term *information security*—or
    anyone interested in the field and wondering where to start. The chapters offer
    clear, nontechnical explanations of how information security works and how to
    apply these principles to your own career. It should help you learn about information
    security without making you consult a massive textbook. I’ll first cover the fundamental
    ideas, such as authentication and authorization, needed to understand the field’s
    key concepts, such as the principle of least privilege and various security models.
    I’ll then dive into a survey of real-world applications of these ideas in the
    areas of operations, human, physical, network, operating system, mobile, embedded,
    Internet of Things (IoT), and application security. I’ll finish up by looking
    at how to assess security.

<p class="ChapterIntro">In the mid-1980s, I landed my first software development job, which introduced me to the <em>relational database management system</em><em> (RDBMS)</em>, a system to store and retrieve data from a database. The concept has been around since 1970, when E.F. Codd published his famous paper introducing the relational model. The term <em>relational</em> refers to the fact that the data is stored in a grid of rows and columns, otherwise known as a table.</p>
<p>At the time I started out, commercial database systems weren’t widely available. In fact, I didn’t know anybody else who was using one. The RDBMS I used was imperfect, with no graphical interface and a command line interface that periodically crashed for no apparent reason. Since the World Wide Web had yet to be invented, there were no websites I could turn to for help, so I had no choice but to start my system back up and hope for the best.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxii" id="Page_xxii"/>Still, the idea was pretty cool. I saved large amounts of data in tables I created based on the nature of the information I wanted to store. I defined table columns, loaded data into the tables from files, and queried that data with <em>Structured Query Language (SQL)</em>, a language for interacting with databases that allowed me to add, change, and delete multiple rows of data in a snap. I could manage an entire company’s data using this technology!</p>
<p>Today, relational database management systems are ubiquitous and, thankfully, far more stable and advanced than the clunkers I used in the ’80s. SQL has also vastly improved. The focus of this book is MySQL, which has become the most popular open source RDBMS in the world since its creation in 1995.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">This book will teach you to use MySQL using its Community Server (also known as the Community Edition), which is free to use and has the features most people need. There are also paid versions of MySQL, including the Enterprise Edition, that come with extra features and capabilities. All editions run on a wide variety of operating systems, such as Linux, Windows, macOS, and even the cloud, and have a robust set of features and tools.</p>
<p>Throughout this book, you’ll explore the most useful parts of MySQL development, as well as insights I’ve picked up over the years. We’ll cover how to write SQL statements; create tables, functions, triggers, and views; and ensure the integrity of your data. In the last three chapters, you’ll see how to use MySQL in the real world through hands-on projects.</p>
<p>This book is organized in five parts:</p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Part I: Getting Started</b></p>
<p class="RunInPara"><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 1: Installing MySQL and Tools</span>  Shows you how to download MySQL and offers some tips for installing it on various operating systems. You’ll also install two tools to access MySQL: MySQL Workbench and the MySQL command line client.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">This book is suitable for anyone interested in MySQL, including folks new to MySQL and databases, developers who would like a refresher, and even seasoned software developers transitioning to MySQL from another database system.</p>
<p>Since this book focuses on MySQL <em>development</em> rather than <em>administration</em>, MySQL database administrators (DBAs) may want to look elsewhere. While I occasionally wander into a topic of interest to a DBA (like granting permissions on tables), I don’t delve into server setup, storage capacity, backup, recovery, or most other DBA-related issues.</p>
<p>I’ve designed this book for MySQL beginners, but if you’d like to attempt the exercises in your own MySQL environment, <a class="xref" href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> will guide you through downloading and installing MySQL.</p>
<h2 id="h1-503007f07-0003"><a class="XrefDestination" id="SQLinMySQLvsSQLinOtherDatabaseSystems"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503007f07-004"/>SQL in MySQL vs. SQL in Other Database Systems</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Learning SQL is an important part of using MySQL. SQL allows you to store, modify, and delete data from your databases, as well as create and remove tables, query your data, and much more.</p>
<p>Relational database management systems other than MySQL, including Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, also use SQL. In theory, the SQL used in these systems is standardized according to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) specifications. In practice, however, there are some differences among the database systems.</p>
<p>Each database system comes with its own extension of SQL. For example, Oracle provides a procedural extension of SQL called Procedural Language/SQL (PL/SQL). Microsoft SQL Server comes with Transact-SQL (T-SQL). PostgreSQL comes with Procedural Language/PostgreSQL (PL/pgSQL). MySQL doesn’t have a fancy name for its extension; it’s simply called the MySQL stored program language. These SQL extensions all use different syntaxes.</p>
<p>Database systems created these extensions because SQL is a <em>non-procedural</em> language, meaning it’s great for retrieving and storing data to or from a database, but it isn’t designed to be a procedural programming language like Java or Python that allows us to use <code>if...then</code> logic or <code>while</code> loops, for example. The database procedural extensions add that functionality.</p>
<p>Therefore, while much of the SQL knowledge you learn from this book will be transferable to other database systems, some of the syntax may require tweaking if you want to run your queries with a database system other than MySQL.</p>
<h2 id="h1-503007f07-0004"><a class="XrefDestination" id="UsingtheOnlineResources"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503007f07-005"/>Using the Online Resources</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">This book includes many example scripts, which you can find at <a href="https://github.com/ricksilva/mysql_cc" class="LinkURL">https://github.com/ricksilva/mysql_cc</a>. The scripts for Chapters <a class="xref" href="c02.xhtml">2</a>–<a class="xref" href="c18.xhtml">18</a> follow the naming convention <em>chapter_X.sql</em>, where <em>X</em> is the chapter number. Chapters <a class="xref" href="c15.xhtml">15</a> and <a class="xref" href="c16.xhtml">16</a> have additional scripts in folders named <em>chapter_15</em> and <em>chapter_16</em>.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxv" id="Page_xxv"/>Each script creates the MySQL databases and tables shown in the corresponding chapter. The script also contains example code and answers for the exercises. I recommend attempting the exercises yourself, but feel free to use this resource if you get stuck or want to check your answers.</p>
<p>You can browse through the scripts and copy commands as you see fit. From GitHub, paste the commands into your environment using a tool like MySQL Workbench or the MySQL command line client (these tools are discussed in <a class="xref" href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>). Alternatively, you can download the scripts to your computer. To do this, navigate to the GitHub repository and click the green <b>Code</b> button. Choose the <b>Download ZIP</b> option to download the scripts as a ZIP file.</p>
<p>For more information on MySQL and the tools available, visit <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/" class="LinkURL">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/</a>. The MySQL reference manual is particularly helpful. Documentation for MySQL Workbench can be found at <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/" class="LinkURL">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/</a>, and for documentation on the MySQL command line you can check out <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html" class="LinkURL">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html</a>.</p>

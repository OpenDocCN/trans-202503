- en: The concepts of representation and computation are closely linked. Humans often
    need to represent the state of part of their world, as an aid to their own memories
    or as proof to other humans that something has happened or is going to happen.
    Once you have a representation, you can also use it to perform computations, to
    simulate what would happen if certain actions were done, or to deduce conclusions
    from what is known.

    to be paid. Static representations are useful for these purposes, and once these
    exist we can use them in computations to answer questions such as what would happen
    if we bought something, or how long it will take to repay a debt. Representation
    thus comes before computation, both conceptually and historically. Let’s trace
    how it evolved, from humanity’s first efforts to the symbol systems that we use

    example, represented the actual animal and could probably have been exchanged
    for it. This would have simplified trading, as you could travel from the city
    of Ur to the city of Uruk with 10 animal tokens and make a deal by swapping them
    for, say, 20 beer tokens, with the actual objects only being moved around later,
    after a successful deal. These tokens could also have been divided between groups
    of people or given as tax to the king.

    addition is order O(*m*) in the size of the numbers being added.

    by sealing many tokens in a clay “envelope” called a *bulla*, shown in [Figure
    2-3](ch02.xhtml#ch02fig3). The bulla was sealed both physically, by joining its
    clay to encapsulate the contents, and informationally, by stamping a complex,
    unforgeable mark onto it. (This is the origin of ceremonial seals still used today
    on royal and governmental documents, such as the Great Seal of the USA. It’s also
    the origin of later digital signatures.) The seal guaranteed, probably in the
    name of the king or another powerful and trustworthy person, that a certain number
    of tokens were contained within it. This way, instead of counting out 12 animal
    tokens, you could hand over a bulla of 12 animals at a time. The bulla would function
    like a 12-token coin or banknote, but one that physically contained the 12 tokens
    inside.

    Counting out *n* scratches usually requires *n* operations, but if we replace,
    say, every fifth vertical stroke with a diagonal one going through the previous
    four, we can quickly count how many groups of five we have.

    numbers. Humans appear to perceive the sizes of sets of 1, 2, 3, and 4 objects
    directly and immediately. Beyond this, our immediate perception is of *numerosity*
    or approximate size rather than exact number, based on sizes roughly around 5,
    10, 20, 50, 100, and 1,000\. Most number symbol alphabets reflect this, with Egyptian,
    Chinese, and Arabic numbers having special symbols for 1, 2, 3, and 4 that feature
    the corresponding number of strokes, and more abstract symbols for 5 and above.
    The Roman numeral system also uses symbols to represent the “landmark” numbers,
    such as V = 5, X = 10, L = 50, C = 100, and M = 1,000, with smaller-valued symbols
    positioned before or after to indicate adjustments to the landmark, such as VI

    the first few significant digits, followed by a separate symbol denoting what

    rotate the shaft by a full circle. For the first part of this rotation, the tappets

    the tappets come into contact and the rotating shaft makes the gear rotate along
    with it for *n*-tenths of a rotation, where *n* is the number represented. This
    rotation of the gear is what gives you access to the number. For example, if you

    number to represent each one. You can then use a bunch of natural numbers in an

    Sumerian trading tokens were “typed”—three cow tokens to represent three cows.
    But when we moved from tokens to more abstract numerals, we lost the information
    about what the numbers were supposed to represent. The numbers needed to be accompanied
    by extra symbols describing the type, as in “3 cows.” Writing thus emerged from
    the same trading tokens as numbers, but it forked to become pictograms and then
    text.'

    (pictograms) to represent them. Pictograms appeared in many cultures, then gradually
    transformed into phonetic symbols. The phonetic and semantic uses may coexist
    for a while—as in modern Chinese—but the phonetic use usually becomes dominant.
    Text symbols also evolved over time to become simplified and easier to write,
    losing the original pictorial similarities to their objects. Where writing was
    carved on stone, the symbols evolved to be made from straight lines that are easier
    to carve. The most common symbols evolved fastest into quick-to-write shapes.
    They thus became the handiest to use in phonetic transcriptions, so the phonetic
    letters that survived the transition from pictures to sounds tended to come from
    the most common words.

    English was just under 7 bits. The design decision was to thus use 8-bit representations
    for ASCII characters but to always make the first bit a 0\. In the future, if
    additional characters were needed, this first bit could be used for other purposes.
    This has now happened, giving rise to the modern Unicode Standard.

    sprite, leaving the background intact behind its shape. Non-binary alphas can
    also be used to blend images together by making them partially transparent to
    various degrees. Including an alpha channel is especially convenient because having
    four channels makes a power of two, which plays nicely with binary architectures.
    For example, it is common to use 32-bit colors with four 8-bit channels, rather
    than 24-bit colors with three 8-bit channels, on a 32-bit machine. Of course,
    this requires more storage, so pixel values might be stored as 24 bits and converted

    quality. Consumer media such as Blu-ray uses a depth of 24 bits, around the maximum

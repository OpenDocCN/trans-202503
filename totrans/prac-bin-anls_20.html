<p class="startpara">In <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06">Chapter 6</a>, I used IDA Pro for the recursive disassembly examples and <span class="literal">objdump</span> for linear disassembly, but you may prefer different tools. This appendix lists popular disassemblers and binary analysis tools you may find useful, including interactive disassemblers for reverse engineering and disassembly APIs and debuggers capable of execution tracing.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="appc_1">C.1 Disassemblers</h3>&#13;
<p class="li"><strong>IDA Pro</strong> (Windows, Linux, macOS; <em><a href="http://www.hex-rays.com">www.hex-rays.com</a></em>)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent2">This is the de facto industry-standard recursive disassembler. It’s interactive and includes Python and IDC scripting APIs and a decompiler. It’s one of the best disassemblers out there but also one of the most expensive ($700 for the most basic version). An older version (v7) is available for free, though it supports x86-64 only and doesn’t include the decompiler.</p>&#13;
<p class="li"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_414"/><strong>Hopper</strong> (Linux, macOS; <em><a href="http://www.hopperapp.com">www.hopperapp.com</a></em>)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent2">This is a simpler and cheaper alternative to IDA Pro. It shares many of IDA’s features, including Python scripting and decompilation, albeit less fully developed.</p>&#13;
<p class="li"><strong>ODA</strong> (Any platform; <em><a href="http://onlinedisassembler.com">onlinedisassembler.com</a></em>)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent2">The Online Disassembler is a free, lightweight, online recursive disassembler that’s great for quick experiments. You can upload binaries or enter bytes into a console.</p>&#13;
<p class="li"><strong>Binary Ninja</strong> (Windows, Linux, macOS; <em>binary.ninja</em>)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent2">A promising newcomer, Binary Ninja offers an interactive recursive disassembler that supports multiple architectures as well as extensive scripting support for C, C++, and Python. Decompilation functionality is a planned feature. Binary Ninja is not free, but the personal edition is relatively cheap for a fully featured reversing platform at $149. There’s also a limited demo version available.</p>&#13;
<p class="li"><strong>Relyze</strong> (Windows; <em><a href="http://www.relyze.com">www.relyze.com</a></em>)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent2">Relyze is an interactive recursive disassembler that offers binary diffing functionality and scripting support in Ruby. It’s commercial but cheaper than IDA Pro.</p>&#13;
<p class="li"><strong>Medusa</strong> (Windows, Linux; <em><a href="http://github.com/wisk/medusa/">github.com/wisk/medusa/</a></em>)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent2">Medusa is an interactive, multi-architecture, recursive disassembler with Python scripting functionality. In contrast to most comparable disassemblers, it’s completely free and open source.</p>&#13;
<p class="li"><strong>radare</strong> (Windows, Linux, macOS; <em><a href="http://www.radare.org">www.radare.org</a></em> )</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent2">This is an extremely versatile command line–oriented reverse engineering framework. It’s a bit different from other disassemblers in that it’s structured as a set of tools rather than as a single coherent interface. The ability to arbitrarily combine these tools from the command line makes radare flexible. It offers both linear and recursive disassembly modes and can be used interactively as well as fully scripted. It’s aimed at reverse engineering, forensics, and hacking. This tool set is free and open source.</p>&#13;
<p class="li"><strong>objdump</strong> (Linux, macOS; <em><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/">www.gnu.org/software/binutils/</a></em>)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent2">This is the well-known linear disassembler used in this book. It’s free and open source. The GNU version is part of GNU binutils and comes prepackaged for all Linux distributions. It’s also available for macOS (and Windows, if you install Cygwin<sup><a id="appcfn_1a" href="footnote.xhtml#appcfn_1">1</a></sup>).</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="appc_2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_415"/>C.2 Debuggers</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><strong>gdb</strong> (Linux; <em><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">www.gnu.org/software/gdb/</a></em>)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent2">The GNU Debugger is the standard debugger on Linux systems and is meant primarily for interactive debugging. It also supports remote debugging. While you can also trace execution with <span class="literal">gdb</span>, <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9</a> shows that other tools, such as Pin, are better suited for doing this automatically.</p>&#13;
<p class="li"><strong>OllyDbg</strong> (Windows; <em><a href="http://www.ollydbg.de">www.ollydbg.de</a></em>)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent2">This is a versatile debugger for Windows with built-in functionality for execution tracing and advanced features for unpacking obfuscated binaries. It’s free but not open source. While there’s no direct scripting functionality, there is an interface for developing plugins.</p>&#13;
<p class="li"><strong>windbg</strong> (Windows; <em><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools</a></em>) This is a Windows debugger distributed by Microsoft that can debug user and kernel mode code, as well as analyze crash dumps.</p>&#13;

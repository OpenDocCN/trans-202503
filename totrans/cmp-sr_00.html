This book will help you use your computer to its full potential, taking you from zero knowledge to being comfortable finding your way around. You’ll learn how to keep in touch with friends and family as well as enjoy free music, videos, and books. You’ll also learn how to explore the internet, use practical and entertaining apps, and protect yourself from viruses and other threats.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxii"/>You’ll learn about your computer’s most useful features in a simple and straightforward way. We’ll cover many new features introduced in Windows 10, so whether you’re starting out with your first computer or just want to learn about the newest features available, this is the book for you!</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3"><a id="toc_lev1"/>About This Book</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This book was inspired by our experience working with seniors. We’ve been teaching computer skills to seniors for a combined 30 years and have created our own Seniors IT program dedicated to helping seniors learn how to use computers in a simple way and with easy activities. Over the years, we’ve been asked many times to turn our famous Seniors IT classes into a book so people can learn when and where they want. Well, here we are!</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentt"><em>Computers for Seniors</em> will teach you to use your computer in the same lesson-by-lesson format we teach to seniors in our classrooms. That means we’ll cover only the truly useful features that other seniors have requested, used, and loved. This book provides step-by-step instructions and full-color pictures to make things as easy to follow as possible. No dry reading here! We hope this book will help you learn the things you truly want to know about your computer.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3"><a id="toc_lev2"/>Who Should Read This Book?</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This book is perfect for all seniors, wherever you fall within that age range, who want to use the computer to stay in touch with people via email or calls, play games, manage photos, explore the internet, or just have fun. We start from scratch, so even if you’ve never used a mouse or keyboard before, you’ll be able to follow along in this book. If you have a little more experience, you’re well catered to with our “Explore” sections, which will help guide you to adventure through bigger ideas and products. You’ll also enjoy discovering lots of new Windows 10 features for work and play.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiii"/><a id="toc_lev3"/>What You’ll Need</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You’ll need a computer device with Windows 10 and an internet connection. Your computer might be a desktop computer, a laptop, or a tablet of any brand—and any version of Windows 10 will work perfectly fine! If you’re upgrading to Windows 10 from an older version, like Windows 7 or Windows 8, this book is also for you.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentt">If you don’t have a computer yet, fear not! We’ll begin with a guide to the sort of computer to buy, how to set up Windows 10, and how to connect to the internet.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentt">Some of the topics covered in this book also require a webcam and speakers. A laptop or tablet computer will have these built in, but if you have a desktop, you might need to buy them separately.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3"><a id="toc_lev4"/>How to Read This Book</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">We strongly recommend you read this book in order, because every lesson builds on the previous one. For example, you’ll need to learn to put photos on your computer before you learn to send photos via email!</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentt">Every lesson includes activities that put your learning into practice, so you should aim to complete those activities. There are solutions at the back of the book if you get stuck or would like some guidance (see “<a href="app04.xhtml#app04">Solutions</a>” on <a href="app04.xhtml#page_305">page 305</a>). A couple of lessons and activities will ask you to work with a friend or family member to do things like making and receiving Skype calls. If you can’t find anyone to help you at that moment, feel free to leave the activity and come back to it later.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentt">The “Explore” sections are designed to encourage you to go further on your own and explore features, apps, and websites that might interest you. “Explore” sections provide help and guidance but not step-by-step instructions. Feel free to try out the “Explore” sections that interest you, but they are in no way mandatory.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3"><a id="toc_lev6"/>What Else Do You Need to Know?</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Although every effort has been made to make sure this book is as up-to-date as possible, Windows 10 is constantly improving, and you might find that small details have changed between the time this book was printed and when it reached your hands. For example, the screenshots might look slightly different from what you see onscreen, or a button might have a different name or color. Regardless, you should still be able to identify what you need from the images provided.</p>&#13;

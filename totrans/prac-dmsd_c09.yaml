    cut through the noise of 24-hour news and home in on the real everyday risks—and
    on actions that can make a difference. To make the problem tractable, perhaps
    the most valuable heuristic is to look at our own behavior, rather than worry
    about the whims of fate or the inevitable mistakes of others. We might not be
    able to dodge the occasional falling piano, nor can we get rid of all distracted

    but perhaps muddied by social conventions or politics. Speeding is a perfect example.
    In many circumstances, moderate speeding isn’t terribly dangerous, and overly
    zealous enforcement of speed limits is widely seen as a sham that pads municipal
    budgets and provides entertainment for local cops. Yet, behaviors that can be

    takes an hour of going 10 miles over the limit to make up for being held up for
    several minutes at a gas station or traffic lights. That’s not to say that speeding
    is never defensible. In good weather, going with the prevailing flow of traffic
    is usually the safest choice, and in many regions, that’s faster than what the
    roadside signs say. But flooring it on narrow city roads or unpredictable rural
    thoroughfares, or driving aggressively when bad weather makes visibility or traction
    poor, is a prime example of taking an unproductive risk.

    task. This is in part because familiarity dulls the perception of risk: urban
    and suburban streets are fine most of the season, but all it takes for slick ice
    to form is a warm day followed by a cold night with little traffic on the road.
    Whenever the pavement looks even the tiniest bit suspect, it’s good to exercise
    the utmost care. It can be instructive to test traction by braking on straight
    and level or uphill sections of the road, provided that no other traffic is nearby
    and no other obvious dangers are in sight. Over time, such experiments can give
    you a better sense of which conditions carry the most risk. It’s also important
    to slow down well ahead of any turns, especially when going downhill or navigating
    an overpass. Sliding in a straight line is usually not disastrous, but losing
    traction while the front wheels are turned can put the car in a violent spin.'

    many others at risk. Because of this, it’s a good habit to approach intersections

    is always a good plan. Visibility matters too: in addition to always looking over
    your shoulder, proper adjustment of side mirrors is crucial and often neglected.
    Many novice drivers believe they need to see the sides of their car, thinking
    that it would help them with parallel parking and similar tricky tasks. But it’s

    folly. It’s not just that high-speed rear-end collisions are more deadly, but
    that if animals or debris are on the road, the car in front of you might swerve
    out of the way, but you won’t see the danger until it’s too late. A good rule

    appears to stem from the cognitive burden of trying to hold the steady pace of
    a conversation with a person not aware of conditions on the road, not from having
    one hand occupied. From this perspective, the laws mandating hands-free setups
    make little sense; it’s better to completely refrain from talking on the phone

    a well-executed jump off a chair or a step ladder poses little risk to people
    in their prime, but the nature of many such incidents is that they don’t allow
    us to land on our feet. Falling sideways, possibly hitting railings, curbs, or

    equally difficult to regain your footing if you lose your balance. In essence,
    any misstep turns into a near-certain fall. Whenever possible, it’s best to avoid
    roof walks, but if you must, consider using an inexpensive harness in conjunction

    prescription for opioids in 2015.^([10](b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-10)) Although most
    users escaped any dire consequences, the survey estimated that about 10 million
    people in the country succumb to opioid abuse every year. The abuse often ends

    the prevalence of opioid addiction shouldn’t necessarily be a reason to shun a
    medication when it helps with debilitating pain, but it should motivate us to
    treat that medication with respect and to seek less dangerous alternatives whenever
    possible. It’s equally important to recognize that opioid withdrawal can cause
    debilitating side effects even for people who used the substance responsibly,

    still needed or it would be safe to wean off.

    too. In this context, acetaminophen is of particular note. This popular pain medication
    has a fairly narrow therapeutic index, meaning the difference between a helpful
    dose and a harmful dose is slim. The medicine can cause severe liver injury in
    quantities as low as 3 to 5 grams for children and 7 to 10 grams for adults. Given
    that a typical pill contains between 500 and 650 milligrams, this may seem like
    a lot—but because many “cold & flu” pills, syrups, and powders also contain acetaminophen,
    accidental overdoses can happen when trying to combine several products to combat
    a particularly nasty flu. All in all, acetaminophen overdoses account for around
    50,000 ER visits and 500 deaths annually in the United States.^([13](b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-13))

    worry too much about: for example, major cuts happen all the time in the kitchen,
    and sometimes they need stitches or even nerve repair—but except for concert pianists
    or a handful of other professions requiring top-notch fine motor skills, they
    don’t matter much in the long run.'

    Choking, for example, is a major risk for young children and the elderly, but
    effective mitigations—beyond learning the Heimlich maneuver—are tough. Similarly,
    suffocation and drowning are two common causes of death for infants and toddlers;
    the latter can be partly managed by keeping toddlers away from backyard pools
    and teaching them to swim, but many other interventions are of dubious utility.
    For instance, consumer-type infant oxygen monitors are probably bunk science and
    a waste of your hard-earned cash.^([19](b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-19))

    that may be relevant to every lifestyle. Everyone faces their own unique hazards,
    from motorcyclists, to avid skydivers, to fanciers of venomous snakes. The examples
    outlined in this chapter point to some of the most common harms and the most universal
    ways of dealing with the risks. As always, however, they merely serve as stepping
    stones for fleshing out a personalized action plan.

    to be gained by stoking the flames of vague existential dread. We need a way to
    cut through the noise of 24-hour news and home in on the real everyday risks—and
    on actions that can make a difference. To make the problem tractable, perhaps
    the most valuable heuristic is to look at our own behavior, rather than worry
    about the whims of fate or the inevitable mistakes of others. We might not be
    able to dodge the occasional falling piano, nor can we get rid of all distracted
    drivers on the road, but we can certainly put down our *own* phone whenever we

    is never defensible. In good weather, going with the prevailing flow of traffic

    Whenever the pavement looks even the tiniest bit suspect, it’s good to exercise
    the utmost care. It can be instructive to test traction by braking on straight
    and level or uphill sections of the road, provided that no other traffic is nearby
    and no other obvious dangers are in sight. Over time, such experiments can give
    you a better sense of which conditions carry the most risk. It’s also important

    on actions that can make a difference. To make the problem tractable, perhaps
    the most valuable heuristic is to look at our own behavior, rather than worry
    about the whims of fate or the inevitable mistakes of others. We might not be
    able to dodge the occasional falling piano, nor can we get rid of all distracted

    takes an hour of going 10 miles over the limit to make up for being held up for
    several minutes at a gas station or traffic lights. That’s not to say that speeding
    is never defensible. In good weather, going with the prevailing flow of traffic
    is usually the safest choice, and in many regions, that’s faster than what the
    roadside signs say. But flooring it on narrow city roads or unpredictable rural
    thoroughfares, or driving aggressively when bad weather makes visibility or traction

    and suburban streets are fine most of the season, but all it takes for slick ice
    to form is a warm day followed by a cold night with little traffic on the road.
    Whenever the pavement looks even the tiniest bit suspect, it’s good to exercise
    the utmost care. It can be instructive to test traction by braking on straight
    and level or uphill sections of the road, provided that no other traffic is nearby
    and no other obvious dangers are in sight. Over time, such experiments can give
    you a better sense of which conditions carry the most risk. It’s also important
    to slow down well ahead of any turns, especially when going downhill or navigating
    an overpass. Sliding in a straight line is usually not disastrous, but losing
    traction while the front wheels are turned can put the car in a violent spin.'

- en: Woodworking and DIY home improvement are some of the most popular hobbies in
    America. Reputable statistics are elusive, but by one industry survey, around
    17 million US households partake in wood crafts of some sort.^([16](b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-16))
    Against the backdrop of far more pastoral avocations such as scrapbooking and
    sewing, garage-based pastimes tend to involve major power tools and carry pronounced
    risks.

- en: The task of running a safe workshop can be made difficult because of information
    overload. We live in an era when hammers and toilet plungers come with warning
    labels, and when the instruction manual for every toaster devotes several pages
    to telling us not to gnaw on the wires and cautioning us that the ejected toast
    may be hot. Flipping past the safety instructions has become a natural instinct—and
    even the most diligent reader may have difficulty distinguishing between real
    hazards and the overzealous base-covering of a compliance officer who’s trying
    to make sure that no consumer can ever sue the company for any conceivable harm.

- en: 'Thankfully, statistics on workshop injuries are tracked fairly well in this
    country. They paint a clear picture too: of common garage tools, table saws emerge
    as by far the worst offenders, accounting for around 40,000 hospital visits and
    4,000 amputations a year.^([17](b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-17)) Such injuries often
    start with the material catching on the rear of the spinning blade and shifting
    violently. The ejected workpiece can cause injuries on its own, but a far more
    serious problem is that the operator’s hand is all of a sudden pushing nothing
    but air, potentially making contact with the blade before there’s a chance to
    react. The instinct to grab the piece as it slips away can make things worse.
    Thankfully, the basic cure to table saw woes is simple: always use push sticks
    or sleds that keep your hands well clear of the danger zone and not in direct
    contact with the machined piece.'

  zh: 值得庆幸的是，关于车间伤害的统计数据在这个国家得到了相当好的跟踪。它们也描绘出了一个清晰的图景：在常见的车库工具中，台锯无疑是最危险的，约占每年40,000次住院治疗和4,000次截肢事件的来源。^[17](b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-17)这些伤害通常从材料卡住旋转锯片的后部并剧烈移动开始。被弹出的工件本身就可能造成伤害，但一个更严重的问题是，操作员的手突然只推到空气中，可能会在没有反应时间的情况下与锯片接触。下意识地抓住滑脱的工件可能会使情况变得更糟。幸运的是，解决台锯问题的基本方法很简单：始终使用推动棒或滑架，将双手远离危险区域，不与加工件直接接触。
- en: Another common garage tool known for causing severe injuries is the angle grinder,
    a device where a brittle abrasive wheel spins at extreme speeds and can shatter
    when driven too hard—or for no discernible reason at all. Such a fracture can
    send sharp and extremely fast-moving pieces of shrapnel toward the face of the
    operator or toward people nearby. Face shields, or at the very least impact-resistant
    safety goggles, are a must. Keeping the plane of the wheel away from the body
    and properly positioning the guard can also help.

  zh: 另一个常见的车库工具，也因导致严重伤害而闻名的，是角磨机。角磨机的脆性砂轮以极高的速度旋转，过度使用时可能会破裂——有时甚至没有任何明显的原因。这种破裂会将锋利且迅速移动的碎片飞向操作员的面部或附近的人。面罩，或者至少是防冲击安全眼镜，是必备的。保持砂轮平面远离身体，并正确安置防护罩也有助于防止伤害。
- en: 'Many other power tools deserve deep reverence; for example, planers, jointers,
    miter saws, routers, and lathes are well-known for mangling the extremities of
    tens of thousands of people every year. Similarly, many gruesome injuries and
    deaths are attributed to outdoor equipment such as lawnmowers, snowblowers, wood
    chippers, and chainsaws. When operating such devices, always follow all the applicable
    safety tips. If the manual is too obtuse, look up reputable tutorials and accident
    reports on the internet. Perhaps the most general safety principle can be borrowed
    from the world of firearms: when working with tools that can maim in the blink
    of an eye, always make sure that at least two separate things need to go wrong
    before any serious harm can occur.'

  zh: 许多其他的电动工具也值得深深敬畏；例如，平刨机、接合机、斜切锯、路由器和车床，每年因其导致数以万计的人员伤残而广为人知。类似地，许多可怕的伤害和死亡事件也与户外设备有关，如割草机、吹雪机、木材粉碎机和链锯。当操作这些设备时，务必遵循所有适用的安全提示。如果说明书过于晦涩难懂，可以在互联网上查找可靠的教程和事故报告。也许最普遍的安全原则可以借鉴自枪械世界：当使用那些可能在转瞬之间造成伤害的工具时，务必确保至少需要两件事情同时发生，才能造成任何严重伤害。
- en: 'In addition to your fingers and arms, your hearing and eyesight are also worth
    preserving. For obvious reasons, putting on eyewear should become a habit when
    working with any caustic chemicals, as well as when dealing with any machining
    operations that can eject chips or bits of damaged tools. Hearing protection is
    a more difficult sell, as the injury tends to happen very gradually and without
    any pain. Many people don’t realize the extent of the damage until they start
    having trouble understanding others around the house. Earmuffs are a good idea
    around any power tools, but especially when working with the ultra-loud ones:
    table saws, chainsaws, planers, nail guns, and so on.'

    either claim a life or have its hapless victim rescued in the nick of time. In
    reality, domestic fires are common, but fatalities are comparatively rare. The
    total number of victims hovers around 2,500 a year,^([18](b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-18))
    with many cases involving very young children, intoxicated individuals, and the
    infirm. The number of serious burns and smoke inhalation injuries is more significant,
    but remains a far cry from other causes discussed in this chapter so far. Still,
    fires make for a worthwhile topic: even when all residents escape bodily harm,
    the mental scars of losing one’s home can take a long time to heal—and the odds
    of a disaster are well within our control.'

- en: As hinted earlier in the book, the bulk of household fires begin in the kitchen,
    where food is often left unattended in the oven and where flammable items may
    be placed near or around the stove top. Keeping the kitchen tidy and not storing
    plastics or cardboard anywhere near the sources of heat is a good habit to have;
    so is always setting a loud alarm clock to help keep track of time when baking
    or slow-cooking any foods.

- en: Working fire alarms and reasonably sized fire extinguishers are a wise investment.
    Nuisance alarms can be dealt with by switching to photoelectric sensors or by
    simply repositioning the sensor away from where you cook. Talking to children
    about escape routes is another low-effort strategy to manage risk. Kids are more
    vulnerable than adults and less able to reason through a traumatic experience;
    they should know we won’t be upset with them if they rip out a window screen to
    exit their room.

- en: Beyond that, it’s wise to examine your daily routines and surroundings for other
    places where fires can easily start. Space heaters are a notorious culprit, especially
    when placed on uneven or cluttered surfaces. The same goes for poorly maintained
    appliances, such as dryers with vents clogged with decades’ worth of lint, and
    for damaged or overloaded outlets and extension cords. Finally, candles, cigarettes,
    and smokable drugs account for a relatively small portion of all fires, but cause
    a disproportionate percentage of deaths, especially when the user falls asleep.

- en: Threats inside the house aside, rural property owners should contemplate creating
    a defensible space around the homestead. The usual recommendation is to maintain
    a zone of around 30 feet around the home that is free of fuels such as coniferous
    trees or dry grass, leaves, and shrubs; and then about 100 feet where the vegetation
    is judiciously thinned and all flammable debris is removed. Such steps can greatly
    reduce the intensity of flames and thus improve the odds that the house will still
    be standing where you left it once the smoke clears.

    cut for close discussion in this book. Some are simply not gruesome enough to
    worry too much about: for example, major cuts happen all the time in the kitchen,
    and sometimes they need stitches or even nerve repair—but except for concert pianists
    or a handful of other professions requiring top-notch fine motor skills, they
    don’t matter much in the long run.'

    Choking, for example, is a major risk for young children and the elderly, but
    effective mitigations—beyond learning the Heimlich maneuver—are tough. Similarly,
    suffocation and drowning are two common causes of death for infants and toddlers;
    the latter can be partly managed by keeping toddlers away from backyard pools
    and teaching them to swim, but many other interventions are of dubious utility.
    For instance, consumer-type infant oxygen monitors are probably bunk science and
    a waste of your hard-earned cash.^([19](b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-19))

    that may be relevant to every lifestyle. Everyone faces their own unique hazards,
    from motorcyclists, to avid skydivers, to fanciers of venomous snakes. The examples
    outlined in this chapter point to some of the most common harms and the most universal
    ways of dealing with the risks. As always, however, they merely serve as stepping
    stones for fleshing out a personalized action plan.

<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">A</span>ndroid also developed its own engineering culture, from a combination of its isolation from the rest of Google plus the fundamentally different products it was working on compared to the rest of the company. Evan Millar observed: “Android felt very much like the Wild West back then. There weren’t very many rules. There weren’t very many tools. There weren’t really a lot of best practices or style guides or anything telling you the right way to do things. But the cool thing about it was that it meant you could kind of do whatever you wanted to do and try whatever you wanted to try. It was a very open-to-innovation, open-to-trying-things sort of culture that I really loved. I was really happy in Android for a long time.</p>
<p>“In retrospect, I can see the pros and cons of that approach. Obviously, there were a lot of people who had done this sort of thing before and knew what they were doing. Really smart people, really experienced people on Android. A lot of these people had been at Be and shipped an OS there. Some of them were at Apple and worked on similar things there. So it’s not that we didn’t have deep expertise and experience, because we did. But it just felt like the Wild West. It felt like nobody really knew what they were doing, and we were just feeling our way through it. We didn’t know if it was going to totally flop, or if it was going to work. And when it worked, I think people were as surprised as they were excited.”</p>
<p>There were also subtler differences between the Android and Google cultures. Google has long had a notion of “20 percent time,” which allows employees to spend up to 20 percent of their time working on some project that could benefit Google.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c31-footnote-1" id="c31-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> It’s a grand tradition that has resulted in some <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_284" title="284"/>fantastic products, including Gmail. Android engineers tended to be too busy doing their main work to ponder what else to take on, so 20 percent time wasn’t as common on the Android team.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Many people at Google didn’t actually know about Android at all for the first couple of years after Android was acquired, because the project was very secretive. But when people did know about it, it wasn’t seen as a successful project in those early days. </p>
<p>Dan Egnor joined Android’s services team from Google’s search team in August of 2007, two months before the SDK launch. “When I decided to join Android, some people were like, ‘Why would you do that? The iPhone is obviously dominating. It’s such an amazing product, why would you go up against that?’ In some cases they’d seen the early prototypes, and were like, ‘Y’all are like months behind, why bother? Apple just obviously wins.’”</p>
<p>San Mehat also came to Android from another group in Google. “When we bought Android, most people were like, ‘What the fuck are we doing?’”</p>
<p>Dave Burke was leading the Mobile team in London at the time, working on Google apps for non-Android platforms. He remembered the internal feeling toward Android: “It was just a random project on the side. There was no way it was going to succeed. People wouldn’t be that negative, but they were like, ‘That’s crazy. How are you possibly going to influence the telecom industry?’”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Android team was so busy trying to get to 1.0 that they didn’t have a lot of time to spend on collaborating with other teams at Google. Tom Moss remembered, “We burned a lot of bridges. But we kind of had to. We really did have to say, ‘No, we have a mission and we have to stick to that mission. When we succeed, everything will be easier.’”</p>
<p>Bob Lee was one of the people to transfer from elsewhere in Google onto the Android team, “which was like a company in a company. Some people were kind of resentful of being acquired and wanted to keep the scrappiness. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_285" title="285"/>In the beginning, we didn’t have code reviews, it was a different interview process, people didn’t write tests. . . . It was a bit of a culture shock for me.”</p>
<p>Peisun Wu, who also came from another team in Google, agreed. It reminded her of companies she’d worked in prior to Google. “The typical roles of product manager: design docs, code reviews, etc., all went out the window when I got to Android. It wasn’t as jarring for me because I had come from two startups, so it was kind of normal. It felt like I had moved to another startup again. It did not feel like Google at all. For other people who came from Google, it was kind of a rude awakening.”</p>
<p>Ficus Kirkpatrick said, “From the other side, they looked on us as clowns. We didn’t do modern testing software practice—we didn’t do any testing at all . . . which was essentially true. It just became entrenched and religious.”</p>
<p>Cédric Beust, who transferred to Android from Google’s mobile team, said: “I had the distinct feeling that I was no longer part of Google when I was on Android. I entered a black hole.”</p>
<p>Evan Millar moved from Android to a different team within Google in 2012. He remembered, “In a lot of ways, it was like joining another company.”</p>

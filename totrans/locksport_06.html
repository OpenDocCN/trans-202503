<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/16fig00.jpg"/></div>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, we’ll walk you through picking a double-acting lever lock. We’ll cover tensioning and picking, troubleshooting, and the various locks you might encounter in competitions. You’ll also learn some tips on how best to practice so that you’re competition ready.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev99">Lever Lockpicking Overview</h3>
<p class="noindent">Picking lever locks, which works similarly to picking the other lock types you’ve explored, is possible for the same reason: manufacturing tolerances. When the lock is made, the levers are stamped out from multiple tools to give the variations of lift, so the levers aren’t <em>exactly</em> the same size, and the stump can’t be perfectly aligned. When you tension the lock, the longest lever will be caught by the stump first. This will keep the bolt from traveling farther back and hold the lever in place. When you move that one binding lever, the next binds up, and so on, until, with any luck, the lock opens.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_312"/>Currently, only LockCon has an annual lever lock championship, so we’ll be examining the technique for picking the locks used there: noncurtained and with a single mainspring controlling the levers. However, the process is mostly the same for curtained and individually sprung locks. The general steps for using a 2-in-1 or Hobbs pick are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li class="noindent">Tension the lock bolt by turning the rear handle of your tensioner to the open direction, which is usually clockwise.</li>
<li class="noindent">Release the tension but hold the pick in position, and use the picking arm to locate the lever pack. You’ll usually know the number of levers in the lock before you start, but make sure you can find each. They’re movable and typically found in either rotational direction.</li>
<li class="noindent">Apply the tension again, and tentatively probe each lever to determine its state and locate the binding one.</li>
<li class="noindent">Move the binding lever until it no longer binds. Generally, you’ll nudge it upward only a millimeter or so—a tiny movement.</li>
<li class="noindent">Repeat this process until the lock opens.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">This process should sound familiar by now. Let’s look at each step in more detail.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec135"><em>Tension the Lock Bolt</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Tension is the metaphorical key to opening any lock by picking; specifically, it is the balance of tensioner rotational force to drive the bolt back and the resulting holding force applied to the levers. The concept is similar to pin tumbler lockpicking: if you don’t apply enough tension, nothing will bind, the lock will keep resetting, and you’ll never open it. If you apply too much tension, everything will jam up so that you won’t be able to manipulate the working parts. With the right amount of tension, however, one lever should bind up enough that you notice it and can hold it in place while moving the picking tool to another location.</p>
<p class="indent">To summarize, you’re aiming for the balance that allows you to both nudge the levers into position and probe them to get feedback. Nudge, don’t fire, the levers—if they bind too hard, you’ll lose control over them.</p>
<p class="indent">When using a 2-in-1, always keep it perpendicular to the lock case. If you don’t, at a minimum you’ll get false readings from the lock case, and the picking tip will hit multiple levers—and at the extreme, you’ll bend or break the tool.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec136"><em>Locate the Lever Pack</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Competition locks, so far, have always had only one lever pack, and figuring out its location comes with experience. The lever pack can be anywhere, but generally it’s next to the bolt, inside the keyway. What you’re feeling for is the solid contact of the bolt and the springy or “clattering” movement of the levers.</p>
<p class="indent">If you hear <em>lock facing to the left</em> or just <em>left facing</em>, it means the bolt is facing to the left, with the levers above the keyway and in front of the bolt, as shown in the photos throughout this section. Keep in mind that if the bolt <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_313"/>is <em>right facing</em>, the levers are now behind the bolt. In that case, you’d reverse your tools: using the picking tool to tension in the opposite rotation, and using the tensioner to pick.</p>
<p class="block1">Usually, the side with the bolt facing left is easier. I’m not entirely sure why; the bolt lath making the levers a few millimeters farther away surely has a negligible effect. Possibly it’s because most people practice that more frequently. On all lever padlocks I know of, you also pick as if the bolt were facing left, because internally it is. Likewise on 95 percent of safe locks, although they can be mounted such that the bolt points vertically as well (a few old ones out there, I suspect, are also right facing). You can reverse any double-sided lock for the challenge of picking “right facing” if you wish.</p>
<p class="listplaini">Just yesterday, I faced a five-lever lock I identified as a Henderson. I don’t recall ever seeing one outside the books before. Though fairly responsive, the lock would go only so far from the “outside”—that is, with the bolt facing to the right. Yes, it was a little worn, but it was also very “gritty” and very hard to turn back the curtain to reset the lock. After almost an hour, I gave up and walked to the other side of the door to try it “left facing.” Just a couple of minutes later, it gave up the fight.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="sec137"><em>Probe the Levers to Determine Their State</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Even if you already know the number of levers in your lock, counting them is good practice. Nearly all British Standard curtained lever locks have five levers. Make sure you have free and full movement under the lever pack; that is, ensure you can get from the front of the lock case to the back, reaching every lever, as some locks deliberately have very low levers to hinder you.</p>
<p class="indent">If you can’t, then either something is wrong or you need to lift each lever a little to get clearance for the picking tool. You won’t need to do this with the 2-in-1/Hobbs-type picks, as they rotate like a key. As long as you rotate these picks back far enough toward the keyhole, you’ll clear the lever pack and/or bolt and can move freely back up under the lever of your choice.</p>
<p class="indent">With the picking tip, check whether the lever bellies (their curved bottom edges) are all the same. If not, odds are high that a lever with a longer belly requires a higher lift, and one with a shorter belly requires a lower lift, or vice versa—there’s information there, and you just have to determine which way around it is! (In many high-security-rated locks, all the bellies are identical to prevent you from using this trick. Indeed, some standards insist on it.)</p>
<p class="indent">Levers have four possible states:</p>
<p class="block12"><strong>Unbound</strong>   The lever moves freely, under gravity or spring pressure.</p>
<p class="block12"><strong>Binding</strong>   The lever binds against the stump.</p>
<p class="block12"><strong>Gated (aka <em>true gated</em>)</strong>   The lever is located in a true gate; that is, it’s positioned such that the stump can clear its gate (see <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16fig1">Figure 16-1</a>).</p>
<p class="block12"><strong>False gated</strong>   The lever is located in a false gate; that is, it’s positioned such that the stump is caught in a false gate, and the lever can no longer move freely.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_314"/>The false gated state is a subset of the gated state. Likewise, binding has varying degrees. The more heavily bound a lever is, the harder it is to move with your picking tool, but it’s also less likely to be disturbed by other levers, gravity, or springs.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch16fig1" src="../images/16fig01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 16-1: The topmost lever in this UNION StrongBOLT is in the true gate, while the levers behind are as yet undisturbed</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">To determine the state of a lever, you probe it with a wire or other picking tool. Nudge the lever to see whether it moves freely and returns under spring pressure (where applicable—if the tool you’re using takes off the spring pressure, this won’t apply until you reset the lock). Also check whether the lever returns loosely under gravity or returns when driven in the opposite direction. A bound lever, like a bound pin, won’t move freely.</p>
<p class="indent">If the lever is tightly bound, excessive pressure from the stump means you won’t be able to move it easily either. When you apply sufficient picking force to overcome the binding force, the energy stored in the natural spring of the picking tool will “fire” the lever upward, like a rubber band flicked across the room. This often pushes the lever past the gate to its maximum height, but there’s no way to know whether you have then <em>overlifted</em> it (gone <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_315"/>too far and blocked the stump). If you have, it’s game over; you can never deliberately reset a chosen lever on a single-bitted key lock.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>Double-bitted locks are somewhat easier to pick because you can reverse the picking tool direction on most of them to drive the lever back downward if it’s too high. However, this will probably move other levers too, as the only thing keeping them in position, if they’re unbound, is friction with the adjacent lever(s)</em>.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec138"><em>Move the Binding Lever</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">As always, remember the element binding order principle: move only the binding lever. Nudge it upward until it stops binding and “jiggles” or “slaps” against the stump. When you tap the lever, it should move freely a small distance, just between the top and bottom of the gate, trapped by the stump.</p>
<p class="indent">At this point, you might be in a true gate or a false gate, or the angle of the lever might be such that it simply stopped binding. (Some locks, such as the UNION ones with reversed levers—the pivot point is on the bolt side—require tiny, repeated lifts, as they bind, then stop binding when lifted slightly. See <a href="ch15.xhtml#ch15fig21">Figure 15-21</a>.) When released, the lever drops back to almost exactly where it started, and the bolt moves imperceptibly. Lift the next binding lever, and the bolt moves imperceptibly again, and that lever also returns almost to its original position.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec139"><em>Repeat the Process to Open the Lock</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">You repeat the preceding step until one of the levers gates and you get a little bolt movement. Keep at the other levers, and in short order, another one will end up in a gate. Eventually, your final lever will bind heavily because of the massive tension you’ve been using to get even a slight movement, and you’ll fire that lever straight past the gate—now you’ve been warned!—and fail to open the lock.</p>
<p class="indent">Keep in mind that as you progress through the levers, the pressure binding each unset lever increases (the pressure that before was spread across, say, four levers, is now all on a single lever). Therefore, you’ll have, for example, a fivefold increase on a good five-lever lock in which all the levers bind at around the same time. The moral of the story: keep it light when you can. Nudge the final lever into position gently!</p>
<p class="indent">Congratulations—you’ve opened a lever lock! In a competition setting, you now call out “Open!” and beam with pride as your time is read out and recorded for posterity. Of course, if it’s a multithrow lock, you have perhaps three more throws before you’re truly finished with the round, but don’t let that detract from the satisfaction of having opened the first one!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev100">Troubleshooting</h3>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes a lever is just not binding. You can increase the tension, but only within limits, because breaking the tool is a really bad idea—not only will it <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_316"/>be expensive to replace, but in a competition it will get you disqualified. In this section, we’ll look at better techniques and work-arounds for when you get stuck.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec140"><em>Pack Compression</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">If you can’t get any of the levers to stay where you want them, you can “cheat” on some locks by <em>compressing the pack</em>: pulling the entire pack of levers together, pinching them with the tensioner, and effectively jamming them against the lock case and their neighboring levers. If you compress them too hard, the entire pack could move as one, or just the target lever and the adjacent one(s). If you pull too gently, the entire pack, or individual levers, could drop and reset when you reduce the tension.</p>
<p class="indent">As with the more usual tensioning method, this technique requires a proper balance. Not only that, but it doesn’t work the same on all locks. In some locks with stamped steel levers and no spacers, like the StrongBOLT shown in <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16fig1">Figure 16-1</a>, compressing the pack can cause the levers to move into the empty spaces between them or to bind into the space where two stamped bumps meet, locking the levers together. Compressing the pack for center bolt locks with levers on either side produces different results as well.</p>
<p class="indent">A true gate is generally larger than a false gate. Therefore, when compressing the pack, you might be able to feel out the locations of the false and true gates, based on the feedback such as a lever slapping or a lack of resistance from a lever rubbing on the stump, even if you can’t get the levers to stay quite where you want just yet. Mentally note these gate locations for later in the picking process.</p>
<p class="indent">On single-spring locks with double-bitted keys, there’s simply no way to move just a single lever reliably, even without pack compression. These levers are very light and free to pivot, so they’ll shift whenever a neighbor is disturbed. Fortunately, you can always push the lever up or down in a double-bitted lock, so record or remember your positions, and then dial them back to where they should be, and you’ll be one step closer to your open.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, note that tilting your tensioner will have much the same effect as compressing the pack. This is fine if you’re doing it intentionally, but if you aren’t, then you’ll be making the task more difficult for yourself, as the feedback you get will be altered. Remember to keep your picking tools in the correct place—perpendicular to the lock.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec141"><em>Antipicks</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">So far, we’ve just assumed that the lever has only a true gate, but that’s generally not the case with higher-security lever or detainer locks. Broadly speaking, antipicks have two categories: ones that you can escape from, and ones that you can’t. V notches and similar machined indents are examples of the former, and square false gates are examples of the latter.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_317"/>V Notches and Machined Indents</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>V notch</em> is a shallow <em>V</em> cut into the front edge of a lever. When the lever is in a false gated state, the stump will hit the lever’s front edge and then move back slightly into the V, and the lever will stop binding. As you find other binding levers and set them, this one will start binding again as the stump moves farther into the V, slowing you down. When you lift this early binding lever higher, the V notch will force the stump, bolt, and tensioner backward, probably releasing some unknown other levers at the same time. Annoying! This is, of course, the role of an antipick: to frustrate the lockpicker and slow them down.</p>
<p class="indent">The good news is that, just as with a spool pin, you can drop the tension a little, increase the lifting force, and pop the lever past the V notch, often without dropping too much. As you push on the falsely set lever, it will push back against your tension, indicating in the same way as a pin tumbler spool.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16fig2">Figure 16-2</a> shows a detainer with two V notches. It takes great skill to balance the tension and the picking forces, and not fire the detainer past the true gate, to where it may well drop into the higher false gate.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch16fig2" src="../images/16fig02.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 16-2: A UAP Tradelocks MAX6MUM six-lever British Standard lock detainer with V notches</em></p>
<p class="indent">As always, you can tell whether a gate is a true gate only after you’re in it. As the stump moves back, the movement of the levers in false gates will become more limited or bind solidly, while the behavior of true gated levers won’t change. For better locks, you’ll need to develop a mental picture of the interior to determine which levers need to be lifted higher or lower to be correctly set.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Square False Gates</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">The <em>square gate</em> antipick is often extremely obvious. You’ll slam into it as you nudge a lever that’s binding well, the tensioner will turn, and for a brief moment you might even be celebrating. But no—you’re in a squared-off trap. No amount of pressure on the picking wire, nor reduced tension on the tensioner, will cause any counter-rotation.</p>
<p class="indent">Once you’re fully into a square false gate, you can’t skip past it, and you’ll have to remember where you were in the lock while you reset it and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_318"/>try again. The next time you lift that lever, you’ll have to lift it higher than you lifted it before to go right past the false gate and reach the true gate, or at least bind somewhere above it.</p>
<p class="indent">Quite often, you’ll find that the picking order is the same, and you’re back at the point of tripping into the square false gate. At this point, you need to drop off as much tension as you can, and try to rapidly skip that lever up to the true gate. It may help to try to compress the lever pack (by pulling the tensioner back toward you) as you do this, to slow or stall the other levers dropping back to rest. Just don’t throw it too high, or you might well be stuck again.</p>
<p class="indent">Review the photos of the various levers throughout this section, including the detainers in <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16fig3">Figure 16-3</a>, and contrast the antipicks.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch16fig3" src="../images/16fig03.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 16-3: Chubb 110 detainers, clockwise from bottom left: 1960s number 7 lift with no extra toe added to prevent overlifting attacks; number 3 lift from the ’80s with deeper false gates; number 1 lift from the ’70s; new number 1 lift with lightly scalloped front edge; a mastered detainer with gates at the 3 and 7 lifts and scalloped front edge; new number 9 lift with scalloped front edge</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Note in <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16fig3">Figure 16-3</a> that all the older detainers in the left column have distinct antipick notches above and below; you can spot the predictable pattern of the antipick notches always exactly one lift away, a fact that was often exploited when NDE opening was required. The newer style (righthand column) removed this weakness: note that the toe, bellies, and even the pivot points are all identical, defeating all simple decoding attacks.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title" id="ch16side1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_319"/><strong>CHUBB DETAINER LOCKS</strong></p>
<p class="sbnoindent">Not all locks are created equal. Some have far higher tolerances than others (they’re manufactured to a higher standard and generally have fewer vulnerabilities for lockpickers to exploit); Chubb (now UNION C-series) locks are generally at the higher end. Additionally, Chubb engineers were experts in the game of lock manipulation and added a few features to hinder lockpicking efforts.</p>
<p class="sbindent">They created the detainer lock: instead of the gate being an H-shaped pocket in the lever, it’s a notch cut into the front of the lever that the stump slides into. This provided more key space, as a tiny difference in key lift could turn into a very large travel distance due to the amplification of the movement. The change also put the useful drill point well away from the keyhole, behind the edge of the door frame. Anyone simply using a drill through the keyhole of a lever lock was already going to be disappointed, but now anyone doing the same with a hole saw would be too! An additional advantage of the detainer is that it allows master keying; note the lever in <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16fig3">Figure 16-3</a> marked 3/7, featuring two true gates. The disadvantages include the higher precision required for the key, and the additional complexity of the checking mechanism.</p>
<p class="sbindent">The genuine Detainer pack is actually made after the key, with the gates milled to match the precut keys at the factory.</p>
<p class="sbindent">The Chubb 110 is considered generally too hard to straight pick, so the extra defense of the square gates shown in <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16fig3">Figure 16-3</a> wasn’t really required. However, the fact that they were easy to decode using a more advanced tool made them suboptimal, so the more complex, “scalloped” front-edge pattern was introduced. The frustration of having to do a full reset when you encountered one of the square gates was replaced by the uncertainties the scalloped edges introduced.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev101">Decoding the Lock</h3>
<p class="noindent">As with picking any other lock, opening a lever lock relies on getting feedback from the locking elements—the levers—to determine their state. Going through all the possible lifts for five levers can be time-consuming. Knowing the tricks that manufacturers use to resist attacks can help you <em>decode</em>, or learn the configuration of, the lock.</p>
<p class="indent">The turn of a key, as well as each bit on the key, traces a circle (see <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16fig4">Figure 16-4</a>). The belly of a pivoted lever forms a semicircle. At the point the key is tested, the curved paths (or <em>arcs</em>) of the bit and its corresponding lever must overlap in the correct place to maintain a true gate throughout the travel of the bolt and key. Otherwise, the bolt stump jams into the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_320"/>levers, causing wear, or, if the paths diverge and force the lever upward into the stump, the lock jams solid, partway open, until the key is turned back.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch16fig4" src="../images/16fig04.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 16-4: Each bit of a different height draws a different-size circle. The arc of a lever must match this arc; otherwise, the lever will ride up and down and jam itself against the stump</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">The longer the throw of the bolt, the harder it is to maintain a true gate. In other words, the farther the stump has to travel into or through the lever, the longer those arcs have to stay overlapped.</p>
<p class="indent">Lower-security locks avoid this difficulty in a couple of ways. They either change the curve of the belly to match the curve of the key so that they overlap within the lock’s tolerance long enough for the stump to travel through the gate, or they simply make the gates wider. (Remember that the stump has to be thick enough to stop force attacks and strong enough to avoid bending under load should someone press on the end of the bolt or try forcing a wrong key, so the gates are generally already quite large to match.)</p>
<p class="indent">A better solution, as noted earlier, is to make all the bellies identical. This leaves a lockpicker with no way to see or probe for the bellies to decode the key. However, this is technically really hard (see <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16fig5">Figure 16-5</a>); of the curtained locks, only some safe locks and the previously mentioned Chubb 110 series detainer door locks have identical bellies, toe, and heel.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch16fig5" src="../images/16fig05.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 16-5: This lock couldn’t have near-identical bellies unless the gates were curved, but regardless, simply lifting the toe or heel of all the levers together, perhaps with a J wire, would open it!</em></p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_321"/>The third belly-modifying option is a combination of the first two: grouping the lever bellies. That is, 1 and 2 (Group X) will have the same bellies, as will 3, 4, and 5 (Group Y) and 6, 7, and 8 (Group Z). This still allows decoding, but it isn’t perfect information anymore; done correctly, there are still lots of keys to try.</p>
<p class="indent">A picker, of course, can easily use this information to their benefit by decoding with the wire and then lifting straight to the area of interest. In the case of an ABACD lock, you’d go, perhaps, high, medium, high, medium, low with your lifts, rather than picking purely with feedback, which could help you avoid antipicks and mapping out the lock by feel.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16fig6">Figure 16-6</a>, notice the bellies and toes of the levers with antipicks above the true gate, and compare them to those with antipicks below the true gate. A grouping emerges, with those stamped 1 through 4 in one group, and 5 through 8 in the other (not all are pictured).</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch16fig6" src="../images/16fig06.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 16-6: The ERA Invincible, now a few decades out of production</em></p>
<p class="indent">Now consider the Ratner Safes lock shown in <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16fig7">Figure 16-7</a>. You can see how the lever bellies betray the lift; the low lift has a smaller radius than the high. To increase the picking difficulty and available key differs, the front edge of the lever gate is narrow, while the back is widened to prevent jamming.</p>
<div class="imagec"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_322"/><img alt="Image" id="ch16fig7" src="../images/16fig07.jpg"/></div>

<p class="indent">Manufacturers also use other tricks. They can cut away the fronts and backs of the levers to defeat this simple way of decoding, making it harder to find out. See the Asec/Legge with vertically sliding levers, shown in <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16fig8">Figure 16-8</a>; and the Mauer 76000 series and the S&amp;G FAS 69x0 series are other examples. Manufacturers might also restrict the rotation of the curtain to prevent easy access to the levers, leaving the fronts of the levers all the same, with the only variation being at a steep angle through the curtain (examples include the UNION StrongBOLT and ERA Fortress). In that case, the lock’s levers can sometimes then be decoded from the heel.</p>
<div class="imagec"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_323"/><img alt="Image" id="ch16fig8" src="../images/16fig08.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 16-8: A Legge sash lock with vertically sliding levers</em></p>
<p class="indent">Looking closely at this Legge lock in <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16fig9">Figure 16-9</a>, you can see the reduced contact lever bellies that slide vertically. A wire picking tool of a standard length will miss the details required to decode, making the task harder. Early models had full-width bellies and were easily read with a wire.</p>

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 16-9: Detail of the levers, with the spacers removed and arranged to show the various belly radii as well as possible</em></p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_324"/>Also notice the subtle antipicks. The main issue with picking these locks is the tendency of the wire to get trapped by the front edge of the cutaway lever toe as it rotates.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title" id="ch16side2"><strong>OTHER TYPES OF DECODING</strong></p>
<p class="sbnoindent">Other decoding methods, including <em>optical</em> (use of a camera, endoscope, or tiny mirror on a stick), <em>wire</em> (poking one or more wires in and gauging rotations), or alternate impressioning techniques (using plasticine or putty to impression the key) may or may not be allowed in competition settings. You’ll have to ask and should expect a no. You can often decode the toe or heel of the levers by using the same double-bend picking wire or 2-in-1 tool you use for the actual picking. You’ll need to practice this on a few target locks beforehand if you want exact results.</p>
<p class="sbindent">However, simply knowing that the first lever is a high lift because the pick rotates much farther before it hits the lever—as compared to the second lever you test, which has barely any rotation—gives you a big clue before you even start picking. You’ll need to know your lock in advance, though; as explained earlier, some are the reverse orientation, and others have identical bellies throughout.</p>
<p class="sbindent">For something more like the Master Locksmiths Association (MLA) exam or an “open” contest, decoding kits and endoscopes are likely fine, as they are equipment the locksmith owns already, and the goal is to open the lock neatly, not to get the best time. Many other decoding techniques can be used, but we’ve already strayed far enough from the subject of this chapter!</p>

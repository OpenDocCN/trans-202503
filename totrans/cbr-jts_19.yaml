- en: While shinobi are often portrayed in popular culture as lone actors, many shinobi
    worked in teams. These teams were particularly adept at discretely relaying information
    to each other in the field. The *Gunpo Jiyoshu* manual describes three call signs,
    or physical markers, that the shinobi developed to communicate with each other
    without arousing suspicion. Based on what the markers were and where they were
    placed, call signs helped shinobi identify a target, marked which path they should
    take at afork in the road, provided directions to an enemy stronghold, or coordinated
    an attack, among other actions. Though call signs were well known within shinobi
    circles, participating shinobi agreed to custom variations prior to a mission
    to ensure that targets or even enemy shinobi could not recognize the call signs
    in the field. The scrolls suggest using markers that are portable, disposable,
    quick to deploy and retract, and placed at ground level. Most importantly, the
    markers had to be visually unique yet unremarkable to the uninitiated.

    by leaving dyed grains of rice in a predetermined, seemingly innocuous location.
    One shinobi would leave red rice, another green, and so on, so that when a fellow
    shinobi saw those few colored grains, they would know their ally had already passed
    through. The beauty of the system was that, while the shinobi could quickly identify
    these items, ordinary passersby would not notice a few oddly colored grains of
    rice. Using similar methods, the shinobi could subtly point a piece of broken
    bamboo to direct an ally toward a chosen footpath, or they could leave a small
    piece of paper on the ground to identify a dwelling that would be burned down,
    lessening the chance that team members would find themselves either victims or
    suspects of arson.^([1](b01.xhtml#endnote-132))

    signs in a target network. We will review the challenge of detecting creative
    call signs and touch on the crux of this challenge: controlling and monitoring
    your environment for an adversary’s actions. You will get a chance, in the thought
    exercise, to build up mental models and solutions to deal with the challenge of

    agency GRU (also known as APT28 or FANCYBEAR) and its allied security agency FSB
    (APT29 or COZYBEAR) were operating on the same network and systems, but they failed
    to use call signs to communicate with each other. This oversight resulted in duplication
    of effort and the creation of observables, anomalies, and other indicators of
    compromise in the victim’s network, likely contributing to the failure of both
    operations.^([2](b01.xhtml#endnote-133)) The lack of communication, which probably
    stemmed from compartmentalization between the two intelligence organizations,
    gives us a sense of what cyber espionage threat groups could learn from the shinobi.

    using covert markers, the DNC hack demonstrates the need for such a protocol to
    exist. It’s reasonable to assume that the GRU and FSB performed an after-action
    report of their DNC hack tradecraft efforts, and they may already have decided
    to implement a call sign protocol in future operations where target overlap is
    a concern. If cyber espionage organizations begin to work regularly in insulated
    but intersecting formations, they will need a way to communicate various information,
    including simply their presence on systems and networks and details about their
    targets, when using normal communication channels is not possible.

    markers; in what cache, temporary table, or memory location markers could reside;
    and how another operator could easily discover them. Note, however, that the cybersecurity
    industry has observed multiple malware families that leave specific files or registry
    keys as a signal to future copies of the virus that the infection has already
    successfully spread to a given machine (and thus that they need not attempt to
    infect it again).^([3](b01.xhtml#endnote-134)) Though this call sign functionality
    could not be implemented as easily against dynamic human threat actors, defenders
    could create files and registry keys that falsely signal infection, prompting
    malware to move on innocuously.

    of a system. Nonetheless, defenders will increasingly need to be able to defend
    against threats that communicate with each other, inside the defender’s environment.

    a cyber espionage operation where a lack of call signs and the resulting uncoordination
    contributed to revealing threat group activity. We discussed how modern threat
    groups will likely continue to gain sophistication—a sophistication that may include
    adopting call sign techniques. We explored what modern digital call signs could

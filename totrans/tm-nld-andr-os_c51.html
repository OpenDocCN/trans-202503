<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">T</span>he original premise of this book was to try to answer the question, “Why did Android succeed?” </p>
<p>But “success” is not really the right word, or even the right concept. In any project, success is never guaranteed, no matter how great things look at any given moment. This is even more true in tech, where changes in hardware, software, fashion, consumer interest, or any of a million other things <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_370" title="370"/>can send a seemingly successful product into the sinkhole of obsolescence almost overnight. Things change so quickly in this field that there is never a sense of “We made it!,” but rather a slightly nervous, “We’re still here!,” or maybe even a doubtful, “We’re still here?,” while looking over your shoulder to see who’s behind you and how fast they’re catching up.</p>
<p>For Android, the platform gained enough traction with manufacturers, carriers, developers, and users to be allowed to continue to exist and improve over the last several years. And in high tech, that’s about as good as it gets.</p>

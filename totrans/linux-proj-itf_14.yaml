- en: A device special file corresponds to a device on the system. Within the kernel,
    each device type has a corresponding device driver, which handles all I/O requests
    for the device. A *device driver* is a unit of kernel code that implements a set
    of operations that (normally) correspond to input and output actions on an associated
    piece of hardware. The API provided by device drivers is fixed, and includes operations
    corresponding to the system calls *open()*, *close()*, *read()*, *write()*, *mmap()*,
    and *ioctl()*. The fact that each device driver provides a consistent interface,
    hiding the differences in operation of individual devices, allows for *universality
    of I/O* ([Universality of I/O](ch04.html#universality_of_i_solidus_o "Universality
    of I/O")).

    since its use is straightforward, and the only purpose for which it is required
    nowadays is to create device files, which is not a common application requirement.
    We can also use *mknod()* to create FIFOs ([FIFOs](ch44.html#fifos "FIFOs")),
    but the *mkfifo()* function is preferred for this task. Historically, some UNIX
    implementations also used *mknod()* for creating directories, but this use has
    now been replaced by the *mkdir()* system call. Nevertheless, some UNIX implementations—but
    not Linux—preserve this capability in *mknod()* for backward compatibility. See
    the *mknod(2)* manual page for further details.

    on the system, even if such devices weren’t actually connected to the system.
    This meant that `/dev` could contain literally thousands of unused entries, slowing
    the task of programs that needed to scan the contents of that directory, and making
    it impossible to use the contents of the directory as a means of discovering which
    devices were actually present on the system. In Linux 2.6, these problems are
    solved by the *udev* program. The *udev* program relies on the *sysfs* file system,
    which exports information about devices and other kernel objects into user space
    via a pseudo-file system mounted under `/sys`.

    a particular device within a general class. The major and minor IDs of a device

    between the device special file and the device driver. The name of the device
    file has no relevance when the kernel looks for the device driver.

    bits. The fact that major device IDs are fixed and centrally assigned (by the
    Linux Assigned Names and Numbers Authority; see [http://www.lanana.org/](http://www.lanana.org/))
    further exacerbates this limitation. Linux 2.6 eases this limitation by using
    more bits to hold the major and minor device IDs (respectively, 12 and 20 bits).

    that rotate at high speed (of the order of thousands of revolutions per minute).
    Magnetically encoded information on the disk surface is retrieved or modified
    by read/write heads that move radially across the disk. Physically, information
    on the disk surface is located on a set of concentric circles called *tracks*.
    Tracks themselves are divided into a number of *sectors*, each of which consists
    of a series of *physical* blocks. Physical blocks are typically 512 bytes (or
    some multiple thereof) in size, and represent the smallest unit of information
    that the drive can read or write.

    still takes significant time. The disk head must first move to the appropriate
    track (seek time), then the drive must wait until the appropriate sector rotates
    under the head (rotational latency), and finally the required blocks must be transferred
    (transfer time). The total time required to carry out such an operation is typically
    of the order of milliseconds. By comparison, modern CPUs are capable of executing
    millions of instructions in this time.

    of a file contiguously or even in sequential order (though it does attempt to
    store them close to one another). To locate the file data blocks, the kernel maintains
    a set of pointers in the i-node. The system used for doing this on the *ext2*
    file system is shown in [Figure 14-2](ch14.html#structure_of_file_blocks_for_a_file_in_a
    "Figure 14-2. Structure of file blocks for a file in an ext2 file system").

- en: Removing the need to store the blocks of a file contiguously allows the file
    system to use space in an efficient way. In particular, it reduces the incidence
    of *fragmentation* of free disk space—the wastage created by the existence of
    numerous pieces of noncontiguous free space, all of which are too small to use.
    Put conversely, we could say that the advantage of efficiently using the free
    disk space is paid for by fragmenting files in the filled disk space.

    "Figure 14-2. Structure of file blocks for a file in an ext2 file system")) point
    to the location in the file system of the first 12 blocks of the file. The next
    pointer is a *pointer to a block of pointers* that give the locations of the thirteenth
    and subsequent data blocks of the file. The number of pointers in this block depends
    on the block size of the file system. Each pointer requires 4 bytes, so there
    may be from 256 pointers (for a 1024-byte block size) to 1024 pointers (for a
    4096-byte block size). This allows for quite large files. For even larger files,
    the fourteenth pointer (numbered 13 in the diagram) is a *double indirect pointer*—it
    points to blocks of pointers that in turn point to blocks of pointers that in
    turn point to data blocks of the file. And should the need for a truly enormous
    file arise, there is a further level of indirection: the last pointer in the i-node
    is a *triple-indirect pointer*.'

    To begin with, it allows the i-node structure to be a fixed size, while at the
    same time allowing for files of an arbitrary size. Additionally, it allows the
    file system to store the blocks of a file noncontiguously, while also allowing
    the data to be accessed randomly via *lseek()*; the kernel just needs to calculate
    which pointer(s) to follow. Finally, for small files, which form the overwhelming
    majority of files on most systems, this scheme allows the file data blocks to
    be accessed rapidly via the direct pointers of the i-node.

    150,000 files. Just over 30% of the files were less than 1000 bytes in size, and
    80% occupied 10,000 bytes or less. Assuming a 1024-byte block size, all of the
    latter files could be referenced using just the 12 direct pointers, which can
    refer to blocks containing a total of 12,288 bytes. Using a 4096-byte block size,
    this limit rises to 49,152 bytes (95% of the files on the system fell under that
    limit).

    the theoretical largest file size is slightly more than 1024*1024*1024*4096, or
    approximately 4 terabytes (4096 GB). (We say *slightly more* because of the blocks
    pointed to by the direct, indirect, and double indirect pointers. These are insignificant
    compared to the range that can be pointed to by the triple indirect pointer.)

    described in Section 4.7\. Rather than allocate blocks of null bytes for the holes
    in a file, the file system can just mark (with the value 0) appropriate pointers
    in the i-node and in the indirect pointer blocks to indicate that they don’t refer
    to actual disk blocks.

    Such differences include, for example, the way in which the blocks of a file are

    that worked with files needed to understand the specific details of each file
    system, the task of writing programs that worked with all of the different file
    systems would be nearly impossible. The *virtual file system* (VFS, sometimes

    this problem by creating an abstraction layer for file-system operations (see

    symbolic links, created using *symlink()*). In such cases, the underlying file

    a file-system consistency check (*fsck*) must be performed on reboot in order
    to ensure the integrity of the file system. This is necessary because, at the
    time of the system crash, a file update may have been only partially completed,
    and the file-system metadata (directory entries, i-node information, and file
    data block pointers) may be in an inconsistent state, so that the file system
    might be further damaged if these inconsistencies are not repaired. A file-system
    consistency check ensures the consistency of the file-system metadata. Where possible,

    checks after a system crash. A journaling file system logs (journals) all metadata
    updates to a special on-disk journal file before they are actually carried out.
    The updates are logged in groups of related metadata updates (*transactions*).
    In the event of a system crash in the middle of a transaction, on system reboot,
    the log can be used to rapidly redo any incomplete updates and bring the file
    system back to a consistent state. (To borrow database parlance, we can say that
    a journaling file system ensures that file metadata transactions are always *committed*
    as a complete unit.) Even very large journaling file systems can typically be
    available within seconds after a system crash, making them very attractive for
    systems with high-availability requirements.

    `O_SYNC` flag ([Controlling Kernel Buffering of File I/O](ch13.html#controlling_kernel_buffering_of_file_i_s
    "Controlling Kernel Buffering of File I/O")), but applies only to directory updates.
    The `MS_SYNCHRONOUS` flag described below provides a superset of the functionality
    of `MS_DIRSYNC`, ensuring that both file and directory updates are performed synchronously.
    The `MS_DIRSYNC` flag allows an application to ensure that directory updates (e.g.,
    *open(pathname, O_CREAT)*, *rename()*, *link()*, *unlink()*, *symlink()*, and
    *mkdir()*) are synchronized without incurring the expense of synchronizing all
    file updates. The `FS_DIRSYNC_FL` flag ([I-node Flags (*ext2* Extended File Attributes)](ch15.html#i-node_flags_open_parenthesis_ext2_exten
    "I-node Flags (ext2 Extended File Attributes)")) serves a similar purpose to `MS_DIRSYNC`,
    with the difference that `FS_DIRSYNC_FL` can be applied to individual directories.
    In addition, on Linux, calling *fsync()* on a file descriptor that refers to a
    directory provides a means of synchronizing directory updates on a per-directory
    basis. (This Linux-specific *fsync()* behavior is not specified in SUSv3.)

    In some applications, maintaining this timestamp is not critical, and avoiding

    `MS_REC` to propagate their effects to all of the submounts under a mount subtree.)
    Shared subtrees are designed for use with certain advanced file-system features,

    [Example program](ch28.html#example_program-id39 "Example program")), and the

    file-system mounts to be propagated between mount namespaces in a controlled fashion.
    Details on shared subtrees can be found in the kernel source code file `Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt`
    and [Viro & Pai, 2006].

    of these to date is the *tmpfs* file system, which first appeared in Linux 2.4\.
    The *tmpfs* file system differs from other memory-based file systems in that it
    is a *virtual* memory file system. This means that *tmpfs* uses not only RAM,
    but also the swap space, if RAM is exhausted. (Although the *tmpfs* file system
    described here is Linux-specific, most UNIX implementations provide some form
    of memory-based file system.)

    can be used to allocate a smaller unit of storage at the end of the file if a
    full block is not required. This avoids the waste of space that would otherwise
    occur if a full block was allocated. On such file systems, *f_frsize* is the size
    of a fragment, and *f_bsize* is the size of a whole block. (The notion of fragments
    in UNIX file systems first appeared in the early 1980s with the 4.2BSD Fast File
    System, described in [McKusick et al., 1984].)

    Linux implements a wide variety of file systems, including the traditional *ext2*
    file system. The *ext2* file system is conceptually similar to early UNIX file
    systems, consisting of a boot block, a superblock, an i-node table, and a data
    area containing file data blocks. Each file has an entry in the file system’s
    i-node table. This entry contains various information about the file, including
    its type, size, link count, ownership, permissions, timestamps, and pointers to
    the file’s data blocks.

    file updates are performed. This means that in the event of a system crash, the
    log file can be replayed to quickly restore the file system to a consistent state.
    The key benefit of journaling file systems is that they avoid the lengthy file-system
    consistency checks required by conventional UNIX file systems after a system crash.

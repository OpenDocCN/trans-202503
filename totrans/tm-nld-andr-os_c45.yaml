- en: The marketplace success of the Motorola Droid was the first sign that maybe
    Android would do all right. Android had been slowly gaining in adoption and acceptance,
    but the Droid was the first hugely successful Android-based product, especially
    in the US. One element that distinguished the Droid from previous Android devices
    was that it was the first one with a real marketing campaign. Verizon spent $100
    million on marketing and covered the airwaves with their commercials for “Droid
    Does.”

    a commercial success, as consumers took Android phones more seriously. At the
    same time, partners also took Android more seriously, eventually resulting in
    other products (*many* other products) that pushed sales of Android-based devices
    even further.

    and churning out all these OS updates and it didn’t feel like we were getting
    a hit at all with consumers. And then the Droid had this big first day. And then
    the second day was very similar to the first, it was maybe like 65,000 [devices
    sold]. But then it was like, ‘Oh God, what’s going to happen now? Is that it?
    Were these just super-excited early adopters, and it’s going to go away?’ But
    the numbers continued to be pretty good. My recollection of numbers is bad, but
    it was like 30,000 a day for a long time. Once that kept going and the Droid was
    really, really big, it was like ‘We’re going somewhere now.’”'

    At first, it was a product that nobody wanted. At the same time that Motorola
    approached Google to work on this device together, HTC had also approached Google
    to work together on the Passion phone (which was eventually released as the Nexus
    One). The team was much more excited about the Passion device because it was going
    to be a Google-branded phone, with more ownership and control over the final product.

    want to do the deal to begin with, for various reasons including the carrier network
    details. Rich Miner recalled, “Andy didn’t want to do CDMA [the Verizon cell phone
    network technology] because all of our first phones on T-Mo were GSM. We [Rich
    and Hiroshi] had to get that thing far enough along basically against Andy’s desire
    so that it had enough momentum that it was clear that we shouldn’t stop it.”

    Verizon wanted the Droid to be a Verizon device, and the main brands associated
    with it were Verizon (the carrier) and Motorola (the manufacturer). The Google
    brand was not on the Droid.

- en: But marketing can help, and the marketing campaign for Droid did just that.
    The campaign capitalized on the unique aspects of the device, and made that potential
    weakness its strength, pitching it as a robotic device that did so much more than
    the competition. It apparently worked, and people bought Droids in much larger
    quantities in the US than had bought any other Android phones before. The days
    of Android being outsold hugely by the competition were over, as the market share
    of Android continued to grow, overtaking iPhone sales completely by the end of
    2010.^([1](#c45-footnote-1))

    we’re all feeling a bit smug and saying, ‘Yeah, we’re doing Verizon, but it’s
    more because we need to put money on the table. But really the thing that matters
    is the Nexus.’ Google, or Android, was arrogant enough to think that just selling
    our phone on our website^([2](#c45-footnote-2)) was good enough. Looking back,
    it was so naive.'

    a lot of us. It was a pretty freaking good commercial. And the Droid ended up
    being a huge success, our phone [the Nexus One] not doing well. I think it was
    a very humbling lesson for all of us. We started realizing the importance of product
    and marketing, and understanding that maybe it was time to pass the baton. We’d
    been driven by technical things. The technical foundation is here; now we need
    to let the real market take over. People like Verizon were going to take it to
    the next level.”

    cheaper device. They wanted this to be the device for everyone. But Verizon was
    like, ‘We don’t have the iPhone. We can’t sell this as a cheap device, from a
    brand and marketing point of view. We have to be seen as being as good as the
    other one.’”

    team. Charles said, “I felt like a cheaper device would have been better. But
    Verizon did an amazing job. They hit it spot-on. And the sales and the reception
    showed that.”

    priority placed on it internally. Initially, the Droid and the Nexus One were
    going to launch at the same time. But eventually the decision was made to get
    the Droid out first, then launch the Nexus One afterward. The Droid launched in
    November of 2009, and the Nexus One came out two months later, in January.

    biggest problems [on the G1] we had in Maps was the cache would blow up. We’d
    get ‘Out of Memory’ exceptions, and the app would die while you were using it.
    We did a bunch of stuff to get around it, but there just wasn’t enough RAM to
    work with. When the Droid came in, we could actually deliver the experience.

    the Droid came out, things actually worked well because we had targeted G1\. I
    felt like the G1 was almost like a Beta product, forcing the team to be on very
    tight constraints. The experience [on the Droid] was pretty nice because we built
    for a much tighter environment.”

- en: Another aspect of the Droid hardware that was significant for Android was the
    screen. The Droid was the first device with a screen size (480 × 854) that differed
    from that of the original G1 (320 × 480). Also, the Droid had a higher pixel density
    than the earlier devices (265 versus 180 pixels per inch). This meant that developers
    could, for the first time, see the advantage of building their apps in a way that
    scaled to different screen form factors automatically.

    where the adoption curve of Android hit a swiftly increasing slope. Hiroshi recalled:
    “I remember reading an article that came out maybe a day or two after the Droid
    had launched, where the reporter had interviewed some app developer who had published
    on iPhone, iOS and had already published on Market. They were saying, ‘Wow, we’re
    noticing the Droid already.’ Like two days in, the developer saying, ‘Our installs
    are going way up on Android.’ It was also a moment, not only a consumer moment,
    but also for developers, where they were like, ‘Shit, this platform might have
    legs. There are people who are buying these things.’”'

    a staff meeting he attended. “It was right after the launch, like January, and

    Andy’s staff. I remember Dianne was there and Mike Cleron, basically all the big
    wigs. Hiroshi, obviously.

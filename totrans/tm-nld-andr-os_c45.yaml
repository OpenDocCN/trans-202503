- en: The marketplace success of the Motorola Droid was the first sign that maybe
    Android would do all right. Android had been slowly gaining in adoption and acceptance,
    but the Droid was the first hugely successful Android-based product, especially
    in the US. One element that distinguished the Droid from previous Android devices
    was that it was the first one with a real marketing campaign. Verizon spent $100
    million on marketing and covered the airwaves with their commercials for “Droid
    Does.”

  zh: 摩托罗拉 Droid 的市场成功是 Android 可能会成功的第一个信号。Android 一直在缓慢地获得采用和接受，但 Droid 是第一个大获成功的基于
    Android 的产品，尤其是在美国。与之前的 Android 设备不同，Droid 的一个特点是它是第一个拥有真正营销活动的 Android 设备。Verizon
    投入了 1 亿美元用于营销，并通过他们的“Droid 做到了”广告覆盖了无线电波。
- en: Launched on October 17, 2009, and released in early November, the Droid became
    a commercial success, as consumers took Android phones more seriously. At the
    same time, partners also took Android more seriously, eventually resulting in
    other products (*many* other products) that pushed sales of Android-based devices
    even further.

  zh: Droid 于 2009 年 10 月 17 日发布，并于 11 月初正式发售，成为了商业上的成功，因为消费者开始更加认真地对待 Android 手机。同时，合作伙伴也开始更认真地看待
    Android，最终推动了更多的产品（*许多*产品）的推出，进一步促进了基于 Android 的设备销量。
- en: 'Michael Morrissey remembered the impact of the launch: “We were small and scrappy
    and churning out all these OS updates and it didn’t feel like we were getting
    a hit at all with consumers. And then the Droid had this big first day. And then
    the second day was very similar to the first, it was maybe like 65,000 [devices
    sold]. But then it was like, ‘Oh God, what’s going to happen now? Is that it?
    Were these just super-excited early adopters, and it’s going to go away?’ But
    the numbers continued to be pretty good. My recollection of numbers is bad, but
    it was like 30,000 a day for a long time. Once that kept going and the Droid was
    really, really big, it was like ‘We’re going somewhere now.’”'

    有了一个大销售日。接着第二天也和第一天差不多，可能卖出了 65,000 部设备。但接下来我们就想，‘天啊，现在该怎么办？就这样吗？这些只是超级激动的早期采用者，它会消失吗？’但销量持续不错。我对数字的记忆不太准确，但大概是每天
    30,000 部，持续了一段时间。一旦这种情况继续下去，Droid 真正成为了大热产品，我们就觉得‘我们现在有希望了’。”

    At first, it was a product that nobody wanted. At the same time that Motorola
    approached Google to work on this device together, HTC had also approached Google
    to work together on the Passion phone (which was eventually released as the Nexus
    One). The team was much more excited about the Passion device because it was going
    to be a Google-branded phone, with more ownership and control over the final product.

  zh: 但在 Android 团队内部，Droid 的开发情况却截然不同。起初，这是一个没人想要的产品。就在摩托罗拉接触 Google 合作开发这款设备的同时，HTC
    也接触了 Google，想要共同开发 Passion 手机（最终发布为 Nexus One）。团队对 Passion 设备更为兴奋，因为它将是 Google
    品牌的手机，意味着可以更好地掌控最终产品。
- en: Meanwhile, the Droid languished without love internally. Andy Rubin didn’t even
    want to do the deal to begin with, for various reasons including the carrier network
    details. Rich Miner recalled, “Andy didn’t want to do CDMA [the Verizon cell phone
    network technology] because all of our first phones on T-Mo were GSM. We [Rich
    and Hiroshi] had to get that thing far enough along basically against Andy’s desire
    so that it had enough momentum that it was clear that we shouldn’t stop it.”

- en: But marketing can help, and the marketing campaign for Droid did just that.
    The campaign capitalized on the unique aspects of the device, and made that potential
    weakness its strength, pitching it as a robotic device that did so much more than
    the competition. It apparently worked, and people bought Droids in much larger
    quantities in the US than had bought any other Android phones before. The days
    of Android being outsold hugely by the competition were over, as the market share
    of Android continued to grow, overtaking iPhone sales completely by the end of
    2010.^([1](#c45-footnote-1))

  zh: 但营销能够起到作用，而Droid的营销活动正是做到了这一点。该活动利用了这款设备的独特之处，并将其潜在的弱点转化为强项，把它宣传成一款能够做更多事情的机器人设备，超越了竞争对手。显然，这个策略奏效了，美国市场上购买Droid的数量远超过了以前购买任何其他Android手机的人。Android手机销量曾被竞争对手远远甩在后面，但到了2010年底，Android的市场份额持续增长，完全超过了iPhone的销量。^([1](#c45-footnote-1))

    we’re all feeling a bit smug and saying, ‘Yeah, we’re doing Verizon, but it’s
    more because we need to put money on the table. But really the thing that matters
    is the Nexus.’ Google, or Android, was arrogant enough to think that just selling

    a lot of us. It was a pretty freaking good commercial. And the Droid ended up
    being a huge success, our phone [the Nexus One] not doing well. I think it was
    a very humbling lesson for all of us. We started realizing the importance of product
    and marketing, and understanding that maybe it was time to pass the baton. We’d
    been driven by technical things. The technical foundation is here; now we need
    to let the real market take over. People like Verizon were going to take it to

- en: Another aspect that Charles felt contributed to the Droid’s success was the
    priority placed on it internally. Initially, the Droid and the Nexus One were
    going to launch at the same time. But eventually the decision was made to get
    the Droid out first, then launch the Nexus One afterward. The Droid launched in
    November of 2009, and the Nexus One came out two months later, in January.

    biggest problems [on the G1] we had in Maps was the cache would blow up. We’d
    get ‘Out of Memory’ exceptions, and the app would die while you were using it.
    We did a bunch of stuff to get around it, but there just wasn’t enough RAM to
    work with. When the Droid came in, we could actually deliver the experience.

  zh: Droid的硬件性能也起到了帮助作用。Charles Mendis说：“在G1上，地图的一个最大问题是缓存会崩溃。我们会遇到‘内存不足’的异常，然后应用在使用过程中就死掉了。我们做了很多工作来绕过这个问题，但就是没有足够的RAM可用。当Droid发布时，我们实际上能够提供更好的体验。”
- en: “In G1, we were forced to develop in such a tightly constrained thing that when
    the Droid came out, things actually worked well because we had targeted G1\. I
    felt like the G1 was almost like a Beta product, forcing the team to be on very
    tight constraints. The experience [on the Droid] was pretty nice because we built
    for a much tighter environment.”

- en: Another aspect of the Droid hardware that was significant for Android was the
    screen. The Droid was the first device with a screen size (480 × 854) that differed
    from that of the original G1 (320 × 480). Also, the Droid had a higher pixel density
    than the earlier devices (265 versus 180 pixels per inch). This meant that developers
    could, for the first time, see the advantage of building their apps in a way that
    scaled to different screen form factors automatically.

    had launched, where the reporter had interviewed some app developer who had published
    on iPhone, iOS and had already published on Market. They were saying, ‘Wow, we’re
    noticing the Droid already.’ Like two days in, the developer saying, ‘Our installs
    are going way up on Android.’ It was also a moment, not only a consumer moment,

    two-page website controlled from an Application class. In this chapter, we’ll
    revisit that website and explore how to further leverage OOP techniques to improve
    its structure. You’ll learn how to use multiple classes to compartmentalize the
    application logic, and you’ll see how inheritance can help share code among those
    classes to cut down on redundancy.

    more manageable. This may seem trivial for a two-page website, but imagine if
    the site grew to include tens, hundreds, or thousands of pages. The Application
    class would quickly become unwieldy. It would be imperative to organize the code
    into different types of actions and assign those actions to different classes.

    need to be performed. The first is deciding what to do when a request comes into
    the web server. We can assign this task to a front-controller class that will
    examine each incoming request, including its URL pattern and any data variables
    received, and decide which type of page is appropriate to be returned to the web
    client.

    to a range of page-generating controller classes. One such class might be designed
    for displaying basic pages (such as home and Contact Us), another for displaying
    pages with security features like logging in and updating passwords, another for
    product listings, and so on. Each of these page-controller classes can operate
    knowing that the front controller has already made the decision to return the
    appropriate page.

    latter into a new class called DefaultController. The name reflects that the home

    Application 类去做太多的事情。
- en: For example, say we have some pages that can be accessed only by a logged-in

- en: Another example of the value of separating front-controller actions from page
    controllers is testing the incoming URL patterns for data parameters. Let’s say
    some of the pages of our website display news items by using a NewsItem page controller
    class. The methods of this class need the ID of the news item to be retrieved
    from a database or file store, based on a URL pattern such as */?action=news&id=<id>*.
    In this case, our front controller can check for an integer ID along with the
    news action, then pass that ID to an appropriate NewsItem object method. If no
    such integer ID is found in the URL, we can offer the user an error page instead.

    ID 传递给相应的 NewsItem 对象方法。如果 URL 中没有找到这样的整数 ID，我们可以向用户提供一个错误页面。
- en: In both of these examples, the methods in the page-controller classes can be
    written knowing that any required checks and decisions (determining whether the
    user is logged in or retrieving a news item ID) have already taken place and been

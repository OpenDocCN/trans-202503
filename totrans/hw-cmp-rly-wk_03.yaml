    analogy further. So far, we have water (electric charge), a simple pipe (a copper
    wire), and the rate of water flow (electric current). To that, let’s add a pump,
    connected to the pipe that moves water through the pipe. The greater the water
    pressure, the faster the water flows through the pipe. Relating this to electrical
    circuits, the water pump represents a *power source*, a source of electrical energy,
    such as a battery.

    water pressure influences the rate at which water flows through the pipe, voltage

    voltage, recall from science class that *potential energy*, measured in *joules*,
    is the capacity for doing work. In the case of electricity, *work* means moving
    a charge from one point to another. *Electric potential* is potential energy per
    unit of electric charge, measured in joules per coulomb. Voltage is defined as
    the difference in electric potential between two points. That is, voltage is the
    work required per coulomb to move a charge from one point to another.'

    is measured in *volts*, also abbreviated as *V*. Voltage is always measured between
    two points, such as the positive and negative terminals of a battery. A *terminal*,
    in this context, means an electrical connection point. The higher the voltage,
    the greater the “pressure” to move charge through a circuit from one terminal
    to another, and therefore the higher the current when a voltage source is connected
    in a circuit. However, a voltage can exist even if no current is flowing. For
    example, a 9-volt battery has a voltage of 9V across its terminals even when it
    isn’t connected to anything.

    is the width of the pipe. A very wide pipe allows water to flow in an unrestricted
    manner, but a narrow pipe impedes the flow. If we apply this analogy to circuits,
    the pipe’s width represents *electrical resistance* in a circuit. Resistance is
    a measure of the difficulty for current to flow through a *conductor*—a material
    that allows the flow of current. The higher the resistance of a material, the
    harder it is for current to flow through it.

    has very low resistance; for our purposes, let’s treat it as if it has no resistance
    at all, meaning current can freely flow through it. An electrical component called
    a *resistor* is used in circuits to introduce specific amounts of resistance where
    needed. See [Figure 3-1](ch03.xhtml#ch3fig1) for a photo of a typical resistor.

    Water pressure affects the rate at which water flows, and in the same way, voltage
    affects current—higher voltage means greater current. Water flows freely through
    a wide pipe, as current does through a copper wire. A narrow pipe restricts the
    flow of water, just as a resistor restricts current.

    is attached to the terminals of the battery, the voltage acts like a pressure
    that moves charge through the conductor, creating a current. The conductor has

    *AC* stands for *alternating current*, an electric current that periodically changes
    direction. This is in contrast to *DC*, or *direct current*, where the current
    only flows in one direction. AC is used to transmit electricity from power plants
    to homes and businesses. Appliances, lamps, televisions, and other devices that
    plug directly into a wall socket without an adapter run on AC. Smaller electronics
    such as laptops and smartphones run on DC. When you charge a device like a smartphone,
    an adapter converts the AC from a wall socket to the DC that your device needs.
    Batteries also provide DC. The terms AC and DC are also applied to voltage (for
    example, a *DC voltage source*), in which case they essentially mean “alternating
    voltage” or “direct voltage.” All the circuits we deal with in this book are DC,
    so you don’t need to concern yourself with the details of AC, other than to know
    the distinction between the two.

    that has already been mentioned several times but I haven’t yet defined. An *electrical
    circuit* is a set of electrical components connected in such a way that current
    flows in a loop, from the power source, through the circuit elements, and back
    to the source. Electricity aside, the general term *circuit* means a route that
    starts and finishes at the same place. This is an important concept to remember,
    because without a circuit, current will not flow. A circuit with a break in the
    loop is called an *open circuit*, and when a circuit is open, no current flows.
    On the other hand, a *short circuit* is a path in a circuit that allows current
    to flow with little or no resistance, usually unintentionally.

    is considered 0V, and we measure other voltages in the circuit relative to it.
    As we covered earlier, we always measure voltage between two points, so it’s the
    difference in potential that matters, not the potential at a single point. By
    assigning ground as a reference point of 0V, we make it easier to talk about the
    relative voltage at other points in the circuit. In simple DC circuits like the
    ones we’re discussing here, it’s common for the negative terminal of the battery
    or other power source to be considered ground.

    law*, which tells us that the sum of the voltages around a circuit is zero. This
    means that if a voltage source supplies 9V to a circuit, then the various elements
    in that circuit must collectively “use” 9V. Each element around the circuit loop
    causes a decrease in electric potential. When this happens, we say that voltage
    is *dropped* across each element. Let’s look at the circuit in [Figure 3-9](ch03.xhtml#ch3fig9)

    to three resistors in a circuit. When resistors are connected along a single path
    (*in series*), the total resistance is simply the sum of the individual resistance
    values. In this case, that means that the total resistance is 4kΩ + 6kΩ + 10kΩ
    = 20kΩ. Using Ohm’s law, we can calculate the current through this circuit as
    10V / 20kΩ = 0.5mA. The circuit has four points at which we could measure voltage,
    labeled as V[A], V[B], V[C], and V[D]. We’ll determine the voltage at each point
    relative to the negative terminal of our power supply.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    terminal of the power supply, so V[D] = 0V, or ground. Similarly, V[A] is connected
    to the positive power terminal, so V[A] = 10V. Now we know from Kirchhoff’s voltage
    law that the resistors are each going to cause a voltage drop, so V[B] must be
    something less than 10V, and V[C] must be something less than V[B].'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How much voltage is dropped across the 4kΩ resistor? Ohm’s law says that *V
    = I × R*, so the voltage drop is 0.5mA × 4kΩ = 2V. That means that V[B] will be
    2V less than V[A]. So, V[B] = 10 – 2 = 8V. Similarly, the voltage drop across
    the 6kΩ resistor will be 3V. Therefore, V[C] = 8 – 3 = 5V. Without even doing
    the math, we know from Kirchhoff’s voltage law that 5V must be dropped across
    the 10kΩ resistor, since it’s the final circuit element before the negative terminal,
    at 0V. In [Figure 3-10](ch03.xhtml#ch3fig10), our diagram is updated with voltages

    drops negative. If we sum the positive voltage source with the negative voltage
    drops, we get 10V – 2V – 3V – 5V = 0V. The sum of the voltages around the circuit
    is 0, which is consistent with Kirchhoff’s voltage law.

    of the name is self-explanatory; this is a circuit element that emits light. Specifically,
    it’s a diode that emits light. A *diode* is an electronic component that allows
    current to flow through it in only one direction. Unlike a resistor that allows
    current to flow in either direction, a diode has very low resistance in one direction
    (allowing current flow), and very high resistance in the other direction (impeding
    current flow). An LED is a special kind of diode that also lights up when current
    flows through it. LEDs are available in multiple colors. The circuit diagram symbol
    for an LED is shown in [Figure 3-16](ch03.xhtml#ch3fig16).

- en: To get an LED to emit light, we need to ensure the right amount of current flows
    through it. A standard red LED is rated for a maximum current of about 25mA; we
    don’t want to exceed that maximum current, since doing so can damage the LED.
    Let’s target 20mA as the amount of current we want to flow through our LED. A
    lower current value will still work, but the LED won’t be as bright.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how do we ensure that the right amount of current flows through our LED?
    We just need to choose an appropriate resistor to limit the amount of current
    in our circuit. But before we can do that, you need to know about one more property
    of the LED, *forward voltage*, which describes how much voltage is dropped across
    the LED when current flows through it. A typical red LED has a forward voltage
    of about 2V. Forward voltage is often notated as V[f].

    of 20mA.

- en: In [Figure 3-17](ch03.xhtml#ch3fig17), we have a 9-volt battery, an LED with
    a forward voltage of V[f], and a resistor with a resistance value of *R*. The
    voltage drop across the resistor is V[R]. Keep in mind that the voltage drop across
    the resistor varies with the amount of current that flows through it, unlike the
    LED, where the voltage drop is defined by its forward voltage property. In our
    previous circuit that only had a battery and a resistor ([Figure 3-4](ch03.xhtml#ch3fig4)),
    the entire 9V was dropped across the resistor. Now that we have two circuit elements
    connected to our battery, Kirchhoff’s voltage law tells us that part of the voltage
    will drop across the LED and the rest of the voltage will drop across the resistor.
    As a reminder, you can think of the battery as supplying the voltage, and the
    other elements as using the voltage. If we apply this to our circuit ([Figure
    3-17](ch03.xhtml#ch3fig17)), V[f] + V[R] = 9V.

    – 2V = 7V. Let’s update our diagram with those voltage values, as shown in [Figure

    We can calculate that using Ohm’s law: *I = V / R*, or *R = V / I*. So that gives
    us R = 7V / 20mA = 350Ω. And with that, we have the final piece of our puzzle
    on how to ensure that the right amount of current flows through our LED. We need
    a resistor of about 350Ω connected to our battery and LED.'

    are color-coded; the bands depict multipliers, and the colors represent numeric
    values. Many free resistor color code calculators and charts are online, so I
    won’t go into the details here. For a 10kΩ resistor, look for a resistor with
    brown, black, and orange bands, in that order. The fourth band will usually be
    gold or silver, indicating the manufacturer’s tolerance, the allowed deviation
    from the stated value.

- en: Now you have your circuit built, but how can you tell if anything is happening?
    Unfortunately, this circuit doesn’t visually indicate that it’s working, so it’s
    time to break out the multimeter and measure its various properties. To use a
    multimeter, you’ll need two test leads (the cables used for measurement). Unless
    your multimeter’s test leads are hard-wired, it will probably have two or three
    input terminals for connecting test leads, as shown in [Figure 3-20](ch03.xhtml#ch3fig20).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As shown in [Figure 3-20](ch03.xhtml#ch3fig20), connect one lead to the input
    terminal labeled “COM” (meaning “common”). Conventionally we connect the black
    lead to the COM terminal. If your meter only has two input terminals, just connect
    the second lead, usually colored red, to the second terminal. Meters with three
    terminals typically have a COM input, a high-current input, and a low-current
    input. You’ll want to connect your second lead to the low-current input in this
    case; it’s typically labeled with the various measurement types it supports, something
    like V Ω mA. Usually the high-current input terminal is labeled as A, 10A, 10A
    max, or something along those lines. Again, that’s not the terminal you want to
    use. Some multimeters have four inputs; if this is the case, you must use a different
    input terminal for low-current measurements versus voltage and resistance measurements.
    No matter what kind of meter you have, check the instruction manual if you have
    questions.

    current, or resistance. Let’s begin with voltage. Set your multimeter to measure
    voltage, DC. This may be indicated with V and the letters DC beside it, or you
    may see a series of dashes beside the V to indicate DC (versus a wavy line that
    indicates AC).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have your multimeter set up to read DC voltage, measure the voltage
    across the resistor by touching one lead to the left side of the resistor (metal
    to metal) and the other lead to the right side. Keep in mind that voltage is always
    measured across two points, so it makes sense that we need to measure on both
    sides of the resistor. Since we are powering this circuit with a 9-volt battery,
    and the only circuit element present is the resistor, expect to measure approximately
    9V. While you are measuring, you may notice that the value shown by the meter
    keeps changing a little (usually just the least significant digit, on the right).
    This is a result of the way digital meters work and does not mean your meter or
    your circuit is faulty.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now try swapping the leads, putting the left lead on the right side of the resistor
    and vice versa. You should see the voltage value become negative (or positive
    if it was previously measuring negative). This is because the meter is measuring
    difference in potential and it treats the lead connected to COM as 0V; the measurement
    shown is the voltage difference at the other lead. In [Figure 3-21](ch03.xhtml#ch3fig21),
    you can see the voltage measurement of my circuit—9.56V. That sounds about right
    since a new battery often has slightly higher voltage than advertised.

- en: Next let’s measure the resistance of the resistor. First, disconnect your multimeter
    from the circuit to prevent accidental damage when you change the setting. Then
    set your multimeter to the resistance setting, which may be marked as Ω. With
    nothing connected, your multimeter is likely to show a 1 on the left or OL. This
    means that the resistance value is too large to display—the resistance of air
    is very high! Touch the multimeter leads together and the display should show
    zero. To measure the resistance of the resistor, you’ll want to disconnect it
    from the battery, but you can keep it attached to the breadboard if that is helpful.
    To ensure you see an accurate reading, avoid touching the circuit components and
    the metal of the leads while measuring; if you do, the resistance of your body
    may alter the value. You can see my resistance measurement in [Figure 3-22](ch03.xhtml#ch3fig22);
    in my case the value was 9.88kΩ. The resistor I used had bands of brown, black,
    and orange (indicating 10,000Ω) followed by a gold band (indicating 5 percent
    tolerance), so this measurement looks good. That is, 9.88kΩ is within 5 percent
    of 10kΩ.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At this stage, you know the measured values for both voltage and resistance,
    so you can calculate the expected current using Ohm’s law—the current is voltage
    divided by resistance. For my circuit, that value will be 9.56V / 9,880Ω = 0.97mA.
    Before measuring the current in your circuit, perform that same calculation using
    your voltage and resistance measurements so you can see how much current you should
    expect to find flowing through your circuit.

    your calculation. Measuring current is a bit different from measuring voltage
    or resistance. For the multimeter to be able to measure current, the current needs
    to flow through it. In other words, the meter must become part of the circuit,
    as illustrated in [Figure 3-23](ch03.xhtml#ch3fig23).

    The DC current symbols may be A or mA with DC or a series of dashes to indicate
    DC. Some meters have a single setting for measuring both DC and AC; in that case,
    the symbol may show both a straight line and a wavy line. Once your multimeter
    is on the correct setting, connect it to your circuit as shown in [Figure 3-23](ch03.xhtml#ch3fig23).

    did the previous project, you can keep the 9-volt battery clip hooked up to your
    breadboard, but let’s swap out the 10kΩ resistor for a more appropriately sized
    resistor for this circuit. From our calculations earlier in this chapter in the
    section entitled “Light-Emitting Diodes” on [page 42](ch03.xhtml#page_42), we
    found that we want a 350Ω resistor to deliver 20mA of current. If I look in my
    big variety pack of resistors, I’m not likely to find a 350Ω resistor, and neither
    are you. The closest resistor you are likely to find is 330Ω.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that necessary? Is 330Ω close enough? Let’s find out. If we keep the 9-volt battery
    and still assume that we need to drop 7V across the resistor, then Ohm’s law tells
    us that the current through our circuit will now be *I = V / R* = 7V / 330Ω =
    21.2mA. That will be just fine, since a typical red LED is rated for maximum current
    of about 25mA.

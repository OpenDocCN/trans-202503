<p class="CO">In this chapter, we focus on how the development team constructs its tabletop exercise, from defining a topic to creating the exercise materials. By the end, you’ll have chosen a topic, crafted a scenario and injects, designed a storyboard and ground truth document, and assembled your presentation deck.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Depending on the particulars of each tabletop exercise, you might occasionally skip some of the steps outlined in this chapter. For example, the exercise topic might emerge quickly after a vice president tells you, “We need to practice our ability to respond to a business email compromise.” Many tabletops are developed in this fashion; you’ll know some of the initial components (such as the scope and topic) and fill in the rest (like duration and goals) based on what is already in place. As with each chapter, you should take stock of the organizational dynamics, business requirements, and unique threat landscape of your organization before you proceed.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec1">&#13;
<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_52" aria-label="52"/>&#13;
<h3 class="H1" id="sec1"><span id="h-61"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Choosing a Topic</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">The tabletop exercise’s <i>topic</i> is the overarching issue to explore. It could be an information security–related issue (such as ransomware, an insider threat, or phishing) or a disaster scenario impacting the organization’s ability to respond to information security events (such as a hazardous train derailment or hurricane that prevents the organization’s staff from being able to work). Ideally, you should choose a topic that your organization wants to prepare for and won’t flummox exercise participants when revealed.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The specific topic isn’t as important as you might believe, however, because you can take almost any topic in a variety of directions. For example, an exercise with ransomware as its topic could explore the lateral movement of the attacker (that is, how an attack spreads throughout a network), responses to regulatory entities, business continuity issues, or investigatory actions. You could just as easily explore those issues in exercises based on the topic of a nation-state attack or a vendor security failure.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The topic can be used as an opportunity to consider an area that piques participants’ interest. If the organization has a certain issue on its radar, selecting a related topic could make the exercise especially salient to participants and other stakeholders. This section describes some tips for choosing the topic.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec2">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec2"><span id="h-62"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Consult Your Business Impact Analysis</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">If the organization has performed a <i>business impact analysis (BIA)</i>—a document outlining the possible business impact of various disruptions to business functions and processes—you can use it to help choose your tabletop exercise topic.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Granted, the BIA may focus on a wide spectrum of events, from natural disasters to civil unrest to supply chain interruptions; however, it also likely touches on cybersecurity issues, including ransomware, leaks of protected data (such as intellectual property and personally identifiable information, or PII), and loss of critical computing infrastructure. The BIA may also describe an entire scenario in which a cybersecurity event impacts the organization. If so, you could use this as your topic.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Leveraging the BIA for the tabletop exercise topic provides an opportunity to pull in yet another collaborator: the subject matter expert who spearheaded the BIA, whether their background is in disaster recovery, risk management, or another area. You can enlist this expert to briefly speak at the beginning of the tabletop exercise to explain that the topic was chosen because of its significant impact on the organization, reinforcing the exercise’s importance.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Finally, many organizations have reflected on how to react to a natural disaster (such as an incoming hurricane or snowstorm) but neglected to plan for a cybersecurity incident that could have some of the same impacts. The tabletop exercise could be an opportunity for the business continuity or disaster recovery teams to collaborate with the information security teams to ensure that they consider cybersecurity events in the future.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec3"><span id="h-63"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Confer with the Executive Sponsor</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Another way to find inspiration for the tabletop exercise is to confer with the executive sponsor. More likely than not, they have a particular cybersecurity concern in mind. And even if the topic you choose doesn’t reflect the sponsor’s individual interests, you should seek their feedback to ensure that they’re supportive of and invested in the tabletop exercise topic; not having an executive sponsor supportive of your tabletop exercise topic is counterproductive and should be avoided.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec4"><span id="h-64"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Leverage Other Resources for Inspiration</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Beyond the topic selection methods we’ve just listed, you could develop a relevant topic by:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Asking executives about the cybersecurity concerns that keep them up at night</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Tracking and mining trends from governmental or industry sources for ideas</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Asking vendors involved in cybersecurity what issues they’re seeing in the industry</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Once you’ve settled on a topic, you can begin crafting the exercise’s scenario.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec5"><span id="h-65"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Developing the Scenario</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">The <i>scenario</i> is the unique story that the tabletop exercise explores. For some tabletop exercises, selecting this scenario is a simple process. Perhaps there’s an obvious choice inspired by an event in the news, a known security risk in the organization, a recent internal incident, or a management directive. In these situations, the development phase is likely to progress with smooth sailing.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">However, you might enter into the tabletop exercise development without a specific scenario to explore. Maybe such exercises are new to the organization, or maybe the organization has performed so many tabletop exercises that it has exhausted obvious scenarios. Alternatively, maybe management has requested a tabletop exercise but hasn’t provided parameters for the scenario. If you find yourself in this situation, rest assured that many development teams have faced this exact quandary.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec6">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec6"><span id="h-66"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Characteristics of an Effective Scenario</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">You shouldn’t develop your scenario arbitrarily. As you learned in <span class="Xref1"><a href="chapter2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a></span>, it’s not uncommon for someone in authority or the exercise participants themselves to ask about the chosen scenario prior to the exercise. If this happens, you should be able to articulate the factors that went into its <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_54" aria-label="54"/>development. In addition to being able to meet the goals and objectives of the exercise, the scenario should be:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Realistic</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Relevant to both the organization and the participants</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">An opportunity to examine known or potential weaknesses</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Let’s explore these guidelines further.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec7">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec7"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Keep Scenarios Realistic</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">While you can get creative with your exercise scenario, you don’t have license to cross into the realm of fantasy. Participants may have to suspend a certain degree of disbelief, and a scenario may push the boundaries of what is plausible, but it should not be utterly absurd.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">What makes for a realistic scenario? Try looking at real events for inspiration, including documented cyberattacks, organizational failures to properly respond to an incident, known malware, and insider attacks. You could then try ratcheting up pain points from these known attacks while still staying within the level of plausibility, although there’s no shame in keeping it simple, too. Some of the best tabletops have been incredibly brief, as the examples provided in <span class="Xref1"><a href="part2.xhtml">Part II</a></span> of this book will demonstrate.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">During the tabletop exercise, the facilitator may be put in the position of having to defend the scenario’s viability. In these cases, they might find it useful to have statistics or brief case studies on hand to present to the audience. These statistics and examples should correspond to a specific inject and relate to the organization performing the exercise.</p>&#13;
<aside class="box" aria-labelledby="box-6">&#13;
<h6 class="BT" id="box-6"><span class="SANS_Dogma_OT_Bold_B_11">CASE STUDY: A FAR-FETCHED SCENARIO</span></h6>&#13;
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Let’s consider an example in which a tabletop exercise went sideways because of a far-fetched scenario. A large coffee chain, ColdBrew, wanted to perform an exercise after a recent string of cybersecurity incidents stemming from common failures in information security, including a lack of end-user awareness, poor password policies, and a failure to patch endpoints. The coffee chain had already implemented several improvements to its policies and processes. Next, its information security manager, James, hired an external tabletop facilitator to challenge the staff to think outside the box.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Although the external facilitator suggested a scenario based on the recent incidents, James opted for one that would “throw the staff for a loop.” In the scenario, ColdBrew heard from several payment card providers that many of its stores had been sites of fraudulent transactions. The implicated stores used a point-of-sale (POS) system downloaded onto an iPad from the Apple App Store. Through its investigation, ColdBrew determined that attackers had uploaded a malicious version of the POS system to the iPads by compromising the cellular network, the primary method the iPads used to communicate with the internet.</span> <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_55" aria-label="55"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The attackers had then intercepted updates sent to the POS system and installed the malicious version on ColdBrew’s systems.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">During the exercise, ColdBrew’s CIO called the scenario preposterous, as it required a confluence of independent failure points, including in cellular networks and POS systems. These had no precedent and were highly unlikely, if not outright impossible. After making these comments, the CIO disengaged from the tabletop exercise. The other attendees took their cue from the CIO and checked out as well.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">As you can see, when you push the bounds of reality, participants might lose motivation. If ColdBrew had opted for a scenario that reflected the organization’s threat landscape, the participants might have been more engaged and received more value from the exercise.</span></p>&#13;

<h5 class="H3" id="sec8"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Ensure Scenarios Are Relevant</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">While a <i>realistic</i> scenario is grounded in the realm of possibility, a <i>relevant</i> one is pertinent to the business. In other words, would the scenario elicit a collective “So what?” from participants if it were to occur?</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Relevance is often best measured in terms of the scenario’s business impact, so you need to be familiar with the organization’s pain points. Your exercise doesn’t have to target the most significant business impact, but you should focus on a scenario that is relevant enough to capture the attendees’ attention. Let’s examine a few:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">A fast-food restaurant relies on a software platform that processes drive-through orders. If the system were inaccessible due to a cybersecurity incident, the restaurant would have to take orders by hand, which would be slower, reducing the number of customers it could serve and significantly impacting sales.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Over 80 percent of the purchases at a home improvement store use a credit card. The card payment terminals attached to the POS systems use a third-party vendor to authenticate the customers’ credit cards. If the third-party vendor became inoperable for several days due to a cybersecurity attack, the business would suffer from an immediate loss of sales and diminished customer satisfaction.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">A commercial property in Arizona uses industrial-sized cooling systems, which contractors can log in to remotely to perform health checks. If the credentials became compromised and an attacker shut down the cooling system, the property would be quickly uninhabitable due to Arizona’s desert climate.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">In each of the examples, there is a clear business impact that would be impossible to ignore, capturing the attention of executives and customers alike.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_56" aria-label="56"/>Finally, make sure the executive sponsor agrees that the scenario is relevant. If at any point during the tabletop exercise the executive sponsor could be thinking, <i>So what?</i>, you should adjust the scenario.</p>&#13;
<aside class="box" aria-labelledby="box-7">&#13;
<h6 class="BT" id="box-7"><span class="SANS_Dogma_OT_Bold_B_11">CASE STUDY: A TABLETOP EXERCISE WITH A RELEVANT SCENARIO</span></h6>&#13;
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">ElecNet, a specialty manufacturer of industrial electrical components, planned a tabletop exercise involving a compromise of the IT systems used to manufacture Atlas, its flagship product. Atlas was a mobile electric substation meant for use in disasters, such as after a tornado, when electrical substations have been destroyed. Using the Atlas system, a large trailer could connect to the power grid to provide emergency power to consumers.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">However, when the development team discussed the scenario with the executive sponsor, the sponsor questioned its relevance. Most Atlas purchases happened during an emergency, which required ElecNet to have a sizable number of premade Atlas systems ready for delivery. As there were months’ worth of Atlas systems available to ship, losing the manufacturing systems would be inconvenient but wouldn’t create significant urgency. Also, even a catastrophic information security event would result in several weeks of manufacturing downtime at most, which wouldn’t ultimately impact ElecNet’s ability to fulfill customer orders because of the amount of Atlas systems ElecNet keeps on hand. In other words: so what?</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The executive sponsor provided a more relevant suggestion. Because ElecNet claimed it could ship Atlas systems worldwide to most client sites within 24 hours, the IT systems that supported international customs clearances were far more critical than the manufacturing systems. And because approximately half of ElecNet’s business was international, so were the systems that supported the cross-border transit of the devices. The inability to ship internationally, or any delays incurred by an incident, posed a significant risk to the organization and became the premise of the new scenario.</span></p>&#13;
</aside>&#13;
<p class="TX">The scenario must be relevant to attendees, too, as they’re committing a chunk of their day to it. For example, you could skew a ransomware tabletop toward members of the legal department by focusing on the regulatory concerns of paying a ransom; alternatively, you could focus on the technical attendees’ ability to detect and contain the ransomware.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Ensure that none of the attendees have a reason to ask themselves, <i>Why am I here?</i> If you’re unable to easily identify how a scenario relates to their roles, consider altering it to increase their engagement.</p>&#13;

<h5 class="H3" id="sec9"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Highlight Known or Potential Weaknesses</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">An excellent strategy for making your exercise extra valuable is to choose a scenario that highlights a known or potential weakness in the organization’s <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_57" aria-label="57"/>environment. Organizations often perform tabletop exercises following a cybersecurity incident as part of the “lessons learned” process, when they’ve shored up known deficiencies and want to determine whether there are residual shortcomings to address.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The organization’s information security team may also be aware of a deficiency in their security practices, such as retaining important logs for only a few days. This may occur because the team has been unable to obtain funding to store logs for a longer duration. The exercise provides an opportunity to explore the impact of the deficiency during a cybersecurity incident response. Playing out the scenario in front of leadership might prompt the organization to address the weakness and secure additional funding.</p>&#13;
<aside class="box" aria-labelledby="box-8">&#13;
<h6 class="BT" id="box-8"><span class="SANS_Dogma_OT_Bold_B_11">CASE STUDY: A SCENARIO THAT EXPLORES KNOWN WEAKNESSES</span></h6>&#13;
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The newly appointed information security officer at a bank was concerned about the threat of ransomware. However, when she asked leaders if the bank would entertain paying a ransom, their answers were often contradictory: the CEO emphatically stated “Never”; the chief legal officer said, “Maybe, depending on the situation”; and the CISO believed that paying the ransom would be the only viable option. The information security officer knew that she needed clarity on the bank’s response in such an event; any indecision would prolong the incident response process and hinder recovery efforts.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">To address these discrepancies, the information security officer used a tabletop exercise to bring together the bank’s leadership. In the scenario she developed, ransomware entered the bank’s environment, the backups became corrupted, and the only option to quickly return to business was to pay the attacker. The conversation during the tabletop exercise revealed a lack of agreement that, in the event of a real ransomware attack, would only delay the bank’s response—a fact that the participants acknowledged.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The tabletop provided the forum for all parties to come together and discuss what would happen if the bank were facing a similar situation and to coalesce around a plan of action. By the end of the tabletop exercise, the information security officer better understood leadership’s preferences when it came to paying the ransom—a result that would save valuable time in the organization’s response to an actual incident.</span></p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec10"><span id="h-67"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Sources of Inspiration for Your Scenario</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">In addition to ensuring the scenario is both realistic and relevant, you can seek internal or external sources of inspiration for the scenario. Perhaps the organization has conducted previous assessments that highlighted <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_58" aria-label="58"/>deficiencies within its processes. Or perhaps the FBI and CISA have just released a new joint Cybersecurity Advisory highlighting a new ransomware variant.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Let’s explore some of these inspiration sources further.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec11">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec11"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Review Previous Assessments</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">You can find inspiration for your scenario by looking back to previous assessment activities, such as penetration tests or prior tabletops. These activities should have yielded a report documenting any deficiencies, which you can use to inform your scenario. Using previous assessment activities as your inspiration adds credence to the selected scenario, as it has already been shown to be plausible and to have a demonstrable impact on the organization.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Finally, incorporating an existing security gap into your scenario will likely garner additional support from the organization as a whole or from select members who have an interest in addressing that deficiency. For example, if a prior penetration test revealed that a server was using an antiquated software package with known vulnerabilities, but the business unit resisted risk management’s calls to address it, weaving these details into a scenario will likely earn support from the risk management team for the tabletop exercise.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec12">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec12"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Turn to External Resources</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">If real-world examples or prior cybersecurity events don’t help you settle on a relevant and realistic scenario, consider drawing inspiration from the following free or cost-effective resources:</p>&#13;
<p class="LH"><b>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</b></p>&#13;
<p class="UL">CISA provides scenarios along with corresponding materials at <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cisa-tabletop-exercise-packages"><i>https://<wbr/>www<wbr/>.cisa<wbr/>.gov<wbr/>/cisa<wbr/>-tabletop<wbr/>-exercise<wbr/>-packages</i></a>. Even if the scenarios don’t exactly align with your requirements, the materials may offer a baseline that you can alter as needed.</p>&#13;
<p class="LH"><b>Your cyber insurance provider</b></p>&#13;
<p class="UL">As a party with a vested interest in reducing the risk faced by the organization, your insurer may be able to offer input on which scenarios would be most beneficial in a tabletop exercise.</p>&#13;
<p class="LH"><b>Law enforcement sources</b></p>&#13;
<p class="UL">Law enforcement agencies can describe the threat landscape they observe when responding to criminal matters. Public-private partnerships—such as InfraGard, which serves as a bridge between the FBI and the public sector—enable access to law enforcement professionals. Drawing upon these relationships can provide inspiration based on real-world events.</p>&#13;
<p class="LH"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_59" aria-label="59"/><b>Peers in the cybersecurity industry or in the same industry vertical</b></p>&#13;
<p class="UL">Industry peers are usually happy to exchange information regarding the threat landscape, provided it doesn’t compromise any confidentiality agreements. While reaching out to your contacts is an excellent starting point, you can cast a wider net by posting in LinkedIn groups or other public forums. However, be aware of confidentiality issues when doing so; stating that your organization is performing a tabletop exercise on ransomware because “we just aren’t ready and are a sitting duck for an attack” is fodder for a threat actor. Also keep in mind that this kind of outreach might not be acceptable for some organizations.</p>&#13;
<p class="LH"><b>SEC Form 10-K (if the organization is publicly traded)</b></p>&#13;
<p class="UL">This form—which an organization files to inform shareholders of risk factors it faces (among other items)—is likely to include specific cybersecurity risks, as most organizations recognize the threat posed by cybersecurity attacks.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">With the topic and scenario roughly defined, it’s now time to consider the components of the tabletop exercise that you’ll present to participants via injects.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec13"><span id="h-68"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Introducing Injects</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">An <i>inject</i> is a set of facts presented during the tabletop exercise to convey new information or bring clarity to information previously provided. The inject may also add temporal details, such as the date and time, to artificially move the scenario to some point in the future. It can be as simple as a few bullet points and is intended to help the facilitator guide the scenario and keep participants focused on select areas of the response. It’s helpful to think of an inject as someone coming into your office and telling you what they just discovered.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Let’s consider a few examples. <a href="#fig3-1">Figure 3-1</a> shows an inject for a technical exercise involving data exfiltration from a bank’s SQL server containing sensitive financial data.</p>&#13;
<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_60" aria-label="60"/>&#13;

<figcaption><p class="CAP"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 3-1: An inject slide for a sample tabletop exercise</span></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">During this inject, participants could discuss the technical aspects of the response, such as gathering intelligence on the destination IP, reviewing the SQL server to determine what data was accessed, and reviewing the environment for other systems the threat actor may have compromised.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><a href="#fig3-2">Figure 3-2</a> shifts the focus to the executive leadership’s involvement in an extortion demand from a threat actor who purportedly exported 150GB of data from the environment.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img id="fig3-2" class="img100" src="../images/pg60-2.jpg" alt="" width="1390" height="782"/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 3-2: A leadership-focused inject for a sample tabletop exercise</span></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">During such an inject, we’d expect leadership to discuss the impact of the ransom demand, whether to pay the ransom, the internal and external <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_61" aria-label="61"/>communications required, and how to validate that the data exfiltrated is, in fact, customer data.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Finally, <a href="#fig3-3">Figure 3-3</a> shows an inject to prompt several teams—including information security, information technology, and physical security (at a minimum)—to get involved in the response.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img id="fig3-3" class="img100" src="../images/pg61.jpg" alt="" width="1391" height="798"/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 3-3: An inject to involve nontechnical teams in a sample tabletop exercise</span></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">To respond to this inject, physical security would need to play a major role by determining who had access to the data center at the time that the device was installed, including discussing how long they maintain video footage and access logs. Additionally, information technology and information security would discuss their role and the process of investigating the unknown device.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec14"><span id="h-69"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Simulate Time Constraints</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Injects also enable your exercise to explore, in just a few hours, an incident that may last for weeks or months. You can use injects to insert new information, letting the scenario quickly evolve as it might play out in real time.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">During a complex cybersecurity incident, the organization rarely understands the full extent of the situation right away. It can often take days, weeks, or even months for all parties to get a complete picture of what took place. The initial hours and days of an incident are likely to be filled with bits and pieces of information; confusion abounds, and the best course of action is debatable. Injects are especially helpful for simulating these conditions because they can introduce doubt and confusion into the exercise using controlled information, then explore the incident within the time allotted.</p>&#13;

<p class="TNI">Another reason injects are helpful is that they direct the development team to focus on particular aspects of the organization’s response to a cybersecurity incident. For example, if one objective of a tabletop exercise is to focus on how the organization interacts with the media after a very public and high-profile incident, an inject can introduce a set of facts that steer participants toward addressing that topic. For example, halfway through a tabletop exercise for a medical billing company that has so far focused on business continuity issues, the facilitator might use an inject like the one shown in <a href="#fig3-4">Figure 3-4</a>.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img id="fig3-4" class="img100" src="../images/pg62.jpg" alt="" width="1390" height="787"/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 3-4: A media-involved inject</span></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">Now the group must shift its focus to examining existing processes for communicating with the media, such as who performs the communications, whether the legal team must approve statements, and whether to call in a public relations expert for assistance. An inject is no different from a person running into a conference room filled with incident responders and shouting, “Guys! The media just called! They want a statement by 3 <small>PM</small>!” In a tabletop exercise, you can provide the same information in a controlled fashion with a predefined inject and a low-stress environment in which to discuss the response.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Finally, injects with a specific focus also enable you to ensure that select attendees are included in the discussion. While the inject in <a href="#fig3-4">Figure 3-4</a> focuses on issues pertaining to communications and media, another inject could easily focus on physical security, vendor management, or human resources. Because of the narrow focus, it is important that the development team invite a representative who can address the particular discipline reflected in the inject.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec16"><span id="h-71"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Balance Clarity and Conciseness</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">How many injects are appropriate for a tabletop exercise? As always, it depends, but here are a few factors to consider:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">For a two-hour tabletop exercise, 7 to 10 injects should be enough to provide a coherent story arc that enables the group to explore a variety of topics.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">More injects aren’t necessarily better. The more complicated the tabletop exercise becomes, the less concise and focused the scenario. Also, when a scenario becomes too wide reaching, attendees can be overwhelmed by the number of issues to address. Exploring a few key themes in depth can be more beneficial than scratching the surface of too many.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Depending on the attendees’ culture of participation, some tabletop exercises require only a small number of injects, such as three (the minimum needed to present introductory information, a new piece of information, and a final wrap-up). An especially chatty group with only a few injects can easily consume 90 minutes of discussion.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">If the tabletop exercise is allotted a two-hour block, aim to go short versus long. A tabletop exercise that finishes with time remaining enables participants to complete the scenario without feeling rushed.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">A tabletop exercise that runs long can cause schedule conflicts for attendees, some of whom may be higher-profile executives with already limited availability.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Most tabletop exercises benefit from a question-and-answer session at the end; jamming in too many injects may inhibit this benefit. Because one goal of a tabletop exercise is to develop relationships, setting aside time at the end of the session to discuss leftover topics that emerged or other general concerns can make the event more valuable.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Injects must strike a balance between adding clarity, fostering collaboration between attendees, and creating some ambiguity about which next steps to take. That said, they shouldn’t bog down participants with too many options. Sometimes, the most effective injects have just a few bullets and less than 20 words on a slide. Avoid injects that look like a doctoral dissertation written in 8-point font that take several minutes for participants to fully digest. If you find yourself throwing the kitchen sink at attendees with a single inject, consider breaking the inject into logical segments.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec17"><span id="h-72"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Designing the Exercise Storyboard</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">The general concept of your tabletop exercise is starting to come alive. After some mental thrashing, you’ve defined goals and chosen a topic through which to explore cybersecurity issues. You’ve developed a scenario and identified participants. Now you go off and build it, right?</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">As with most activities in life, even after an idea takes shape, you may find that you have to pivot. The threat landscape might have changed (for example, if a new attack appears in the news), or an executive sponsor might ask <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_64" aria-label="64"/>you to reorient your scenario toward another priority. Sometimes to the frustration of the development team, a tabletop exercise might undergo several modifications prior to delivery. This is where storyboarding comes into play. This practice originated in the film industry as an efficient way to solidify a movie’s plot and aesthetics prior to its production.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Applied to tabletop exercises, the concept is no different: <i>storyboarding</i> is simply making a rough draft of the exercise that you can easily alter if desired. It enables the development team to choreograph the scenario without investing too much time into the process. At this stage, it’s easy to make modifications. With a storyboard, the development team can visualize how the tabletop exercise will play out and identify avenues for improvement or potential pitfalls.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Storyboards do not need to be formal. A few members of the development team can quickly sketch one out on a whiteboard. Include a brief description of the injects (one or two sentences is sufficient) and the key issues each inject is intended to explore. The development team can take a step back, review the storyboard, and ask themselves, “Does this make sense?” Also, an outsider reviewing the storyboard should be able to quickly follow the overall theme and understand what you’re trying to accomplish.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Tabletops frequently follow the structure of NIST’s incident response lifecycle, depicted in <a href="#fig3-5">Figure 3-5</a>, which starts with preparation; breaks down incident response into detection and analysis, as well as containment, eradication, and recovery; and eventually leads to post-incident activity. Tabletop exercises don’t need to explicitly contain the preparation phase, as this stage comprises the tabletop itself and related planning activities.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img id="fig3-5" class="img100" src="../images/pg64.jpg" alt="" width="1328" height="672"/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 3-5: The NIST incident response lifecycle</span></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">For example, most tabletop exercises and real-life cybersecurity incidents start with a simple event: a system administrator recognizing an unusual account with escalated privileges, a network appliance firing off an alert after a security rule is tripped, or a law enforcement agency knocking on the door to notify the organization that its data may have been stolen, to <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_65" aria-label="65"/>name a few. This catalyzing event must be defined during storyboard development and kicks off the tabletop exercise. (We’ll talk more about this in <a href="chapter3.xhtml#h-73">“Considering the Scenario Escalation Pace”</a> on page 67.)</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Once the initial information is presented, new information steadily trickles in via injects, bringing clarity to the scenario without revealing too much information at any one time. Starting slowly keeps the discussion focused on one intended area. Additional injects can add detail to the scenario in future stages, such as containment or recovery efforts, and eventually into a “lessons learned” debrief activity. You can see this process unfold in the following example storyboard.</p>&#13;

<p class="TX">The storyboard is concise, and writing an initial draft should take only about an hour. Any party can quickly understand its overarching theme, the injects that will add nuance, and the key issues to bring up during the discussion. An even more concise storyboard could omit the “Key Issues” sections; however, these help the reader understand the justification for each inject.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Now say the development team wants to adjust the exercise so it includes a unique threat vector, such as an individual outside an MHTS facility breaking into its networks via wireless connections. Making such a course correction while storyboarding is easy to accomplish and wouldn’t impact polished content, such as a PowerPoint deck.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Another benefit of storyboarding is that it enables the development team to provide a rough blueprint to select stakeholders, particularly the executive sponsor, to ensure their buy-in. The tabletop exercise has now evolved from theoretical discussions to a practical draft; especially if you’re a consultant, you can document that the client’s points of contact have weighed in on the scenario and voiced their approval.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec18"><span id="h-73"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Considering the Scenario Escalation Pace</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">When storyboarding and planning your injects, give some thought to the overall escalation pace of the scenario and what is appropriate for the tabletop exercise. The <i>escalation pace</i> refers to the severity of the information being introduced at each inject. In many real-world incident response scenarios, there’s an initial catalyst that may seem relatively benign:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">An end user contacts the help desk because their computer is running slow.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_68" aria-label="68"/>A network administrator observes unexpected spikes in network traffic in the middle of the night when no one is working.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">An end user loses their laptop at the airport.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Each of these examples is worthy of further exploration and could easily become more serious as additional details emerge. In fact, there are plenty of well-known cybersecurity incidents that started with simple events similar to these, only to balloon into a far bigger problem. By starting slowly and building up to a more severe incident, attendees are able to explore how the organization would respond to the initial indicators of a potential threat. As an ancillary benefit, if a participant is attending a tabletop exercise for the first time, this approach eases them into the exercise.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Providing a more consequential set of facts for the initial inject can be appropriate for some tabletop exercises; however, consider whether forgoing the slow buildup to a more severe incident sacrifices a salient exploration of how the organization would respond to indicators of a bigger threat.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec19"><span id="h-74"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Crafting Your Ground Truth Document</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Once you’ve agreed on a rough storyboard, it’s time to craft the ground truth document. The United States’ Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP) defines a <i>ground truth document</i> as follows:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX1">A document comprised of the detailed elements of a scenario that must remain consistent during exercise development [. . .] to ensure that realism is maintained, and objectives can be achieved.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="TX">Whereas the storyboard is an informal sketch that helps you brainstorm the scenario, the ground truth formalizes the tabletop exercise, developing the backstory and defining the injects.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">A ground truth document may not always be necessary. For example, if the organization’s objective is merely getting stakeholders in the room to walk through how a cybersecurity incident would play out, it may be an extraneous formality. Likewise, if the organization wants to conduct a series of quick tabletop exercises over lunch, a ground truth document could be viewed as an unnecessary investment that makes the entire event cumbersome. Finally, a ground truth document may be impractical for tabletop exercises that are exploring situations where the organization may not have defined policies and procedures, as finding the right answer isn’t as relevant as the discussion itself.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">On the other hand, ground truth documents provide structure to the tabletop exercise development process. If the organization wants to implement a tabletop exercise program to regularly evaluate its level of maturity, the ground truth document can demonstrate the program’s existence to auditors, vendors, and other external parties.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Perhaps the most important benefit of creating a ground truth document is that it can shorten the development process by enabling the development <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_69" aria-label="69"/>team to fully explore the tabletop’s initial flow as defined in the storyboard. This exploration may reveal inadequacies, such as misaligned goals and objectives, technical or process gaps in the scenario that strain credulity, or other aspects that give the development team pause. With the ground truth document, you can reorient without having to waste time changing polished materials, such as a PowerPoint deck.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Using the definition from HSEEP, let’s go over some guidelines for crafting a successful ground truth document.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec20">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec20"><span id="h-75"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Add Details and Expected Outcomes</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">While the storyboard provides a very cursory summary of the scenario, the ground truth document is an opportunity to dig into its specific elements. For example, in a storyboard, it would be sufficient to state the following in an inject:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX1">Ransomware enters the environment and encrypts information systems used by the human resources department. Prior to encrypting it, the threat actors exfiltrated data from key systems.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="TX">A ground truth document should contain a greater degree of specificity:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EXF">The director of human resources, Stephen Rosenwald, receives a malicious email from <i>MissingPackage@FredEx.com</i> and clicks the link contained within it. The link downloads a PDF titled <i>MISSINGPACKAGE.PDF</i>, which Rosenwald also clicks.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX">Rosenwald had recently complained about an endpoint security agent consuming system resources, and due to his senior-level position in the organization, the help desk had removed the agent from his system, inhibiting security controls. Furthermore, Rosenwald has administrator access, as is the norm within his company for executives.</p>&#13;
<p class="EXL">Due to the inhibited security controls, when Rosenwald opened the PDF, a variant of the $SomeBot malware family was able to execute, harvest credentials, and allow a foreign actor to connect to the server using Remote Desktop Protocol. The attacker was able to remotely connect to Rosenwald’s account, which had access to the human resources database containing resumes, employee data, and health insurance options.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="TX">As you can see, the storyboard is a compressed, high-level version of what will become the inject, whereas the ground truth is more detailed. The ground truth document also often contains expected outcomes or definitions of success to highlight areas that the participants should address during the exercise. (You’ll see sample definitions of success in the <a href="#box-10">“Ground Truth: Malware Discovery”</a> box on the following page.)</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">While not a complete exploration of the technical and organizational factors that led to the cybersecurity incident, the second paragraph <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_70" aria-label="70"/>contains details that would likely emerge during a tabletop exercise. This may readily address basic questions that participants will immediately ask. With this greater clarity, participants can understand how an incident occurred and what data was accessed, and they can start to assess the significance of the provided information.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Keep in mind that the detailed elements to include will vary based on the audience. If a highly technical audience is expected to participate in the tabletop exercise, the ground truth document should be a technical document written to cover as many technical details as possible that will be discussed. For senior-level tabletop exercises with cross-functional (such as nontechnical) audiences, in-depth technical details are unnecessary.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec21"><span id="h-76"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Maintain Realism</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">The ground truth document is another opportunity to ensure that the scenario stays realistic. Tabletop exercises should examine hypothetical—not farcical—events that the organization might face, and the ground truth document allows the development team to work through the details of a scenario from beginning to end, continually checking that it doesn’t stray too far from the plausible.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec22">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec22"><span id="h-77"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Align with Objectives</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">The ground truth document should also consistently check that the tabletop exercise aligns with the objectives outlined at the onset of the development process. For example, say a primary objective is to test the organization’s ability to effectively manage both public-facing and internal communications. When reviewing the ground truth, the development team may realize that the scenario focuses too heavily on technical factors and business continuity issues and doesn’t prompt a natural exploration of communication tasks. Discovering this mismatch lets them reorient the scenario prior to the exercise.</p>&#13;

<p class="BH1"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Heavy_B_11">OVERVIEW</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">In October, HealthCare Plus Inc. announced an update to its core application, HCP Triage. Released nine months prior, the app’s original version enabled a public-facing administrator account by default, which violated security norms. HCP Gold documentation widely available on the internet included the default administrator credentials. The October update aimed to rectify this information security shortcoming and remove the default administrator account.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Modern Health Technology Solutions (MHTS) is a medical provider using the HCP Triage program. Six months prior to the vulnerability’s discovery, a threat actor used the administrator account to access the information stored on MHTS’s instance of HCP Triage, as well as other MHTS systems. The attacker then silently monitored the environment to determine which systems contained sensitive information.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">During those six months, the threat actor used the misconfigured account to access multiple systems and slowly exfiltrate data over port 3392/TCP using SSH. Additionally, they installed a backdoor on several systems to allow access back into the environment without account credentials.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BH1"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_72" aria-label="72"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Heavy_B_11">INTRODUCTION</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">A system administrator discovers a server consuming a large percentage of CPU resources and, upon further inspection, locates an unknown piece of software, named</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">BS87AB.EXE</span><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">, on the server. Based on an MD5 hash value and initial research in the information security community, the sysadmin suspects that the file is malicious. The information security team is notified of this activity via their preferred communication mechanism,</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">infosec@mhts.net</span><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BBLH"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Heavy_B_11">Key Issues</span></p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Per the organization’s processes, is this a cybersecurity incident?</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">How long will it take before information security reviews the email received?</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Is there a process through which the sysadmin can escalate this incident to parties with a need to know? If so, is the sysadmin aware of the process?</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Is the sysadmin empowered to perform containment measures (such as shutting down a system)?</span></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="BBLH"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Heavy_B_11">Definitions of Success</span></p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Based on MHTS’s Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan definition, this would be considered an incident because a suspected piece of malware has been found on an MHTS asset.</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Based on the information security team’s standard operating procedure, emailed reports should be reviewed within 15 minutes.</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The sysadmin should immediately inform the incident manager of the situation (via phone and email) and ensure the incident manager acknowledges the reported incident. The incident manager will notify the necessary parties based on the known information. This process is outlined in the Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan.</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The sysadmin is empowered to perform containment activities on any systems not categorized as critical, which is defined in the Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan.</span></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="BH1"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Heavy_B_11">INJECT 1</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">MHTS’s network administrators examine network logs and determine that a large amount of data, well over 50GB, was sent from the server to an IP address associated with criminal activity. Open source intelligence of the destination IP address reveals that the threat actor is known to sell stolen data on the dark web.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BBLH"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Heavy_B_11">Key Issues</span></p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">How can we investigate the IP address to obtain information about the destination, and who is responsible for doing so?</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">How many days of network logs are available for network administrators to examine?</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_73" aria-label="73"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Would current logging standards record the network traffic? What limitations in logging may inhibit the analysis?</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Is it possible to determine what data was exfiltrated?</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">At this point, who is in charge of the investigation?</span></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="BBLH"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Heavy_B_11">Definitions of Success</span></p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The network administrators are responsible for investigating logs relating to the IP address, under the direction of the incident manager.</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The Information Security Policy states that all logs are maintained for 90 days. Based on this and the fact that the incident likely started six months ago, there’s a large gap in logging that may hinder analysis.</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Again, per the policy, the data should be available for 90 days within the security information and event management (SIEM) system. The relevant traffic may be discovered in NetFlow data, which is sent to the SIEM, and the response team would need to investigate whether the traffic is available. Given the age of the incident, the relevant data may no longer exist.</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">This will require further investigative work and cannot be confirmed at this time; however, the incident response team should have several artifacts to examine in order to make this determination.</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Based on the Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan, the incident manager is in charge of the investigation.</span></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
</aside>&#13;
<p class="TX">As you can see in this example, the ground truth document builds upon the storyboard and adds further details to define the background of the incident being interrogated. It includes goals and objectives, exercise timing, greater detail in the injects, and expected outcomes.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec23">&#13;
<h3 class="H1" id="sec23"><span id="h-78"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Creating the Presentation Deck</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">With the storyboard complete and the ground truth settled, you can now focus on the deliverable for the tabletop exercise, which is often a slide deck created in the presentation software of your choice. This is the time to let your creative juices run wild.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">While there is no one correct method to approach a presentation deck for a tabletop exercise, this section will provide a series of recommendations for its format and flow, as well as the critical components to cover. Most tabletop exercise presentation decks are broken into the following sections:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Introductions</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Preamble</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Injects and Exercise Discussions</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Debrief</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_74" aria-label="74"/>Some tabletop exercises also include an educational component, such as a short briefing on current trends in the threat landscape (for example, highlighting an uptick in phishing email). Even better, you could highlight security trends distilled from the organization itself; these are especially poignant, as they are relevant to the room.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Additionally, because the assembled group likely consists of members from the incident response team, the gathering could provide a forum for briefly discussing changes to the incident response plan, as well as the roles and responsibilities of participants. This refresher (which, for employees new to the incident response team, may really be more than a refresher) comes at the perfect time, as the group can then apply the material to the tabletop exercise.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec24">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec24"><span id="h-79"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Introductions</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">The introductions section of the presentation deck should contain basic information about the facilitator and their relationship to the organization. If the facilitator is an employee, you might not need to include their credentials, employment history, and so on, but if an outside contractor is facilitating, this background may be helpful to reinforce the breadth of their industry experience (and perhaps show that this isn’t their first tabletop exercise).</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Following the facilitator’s introduction, set aside time for participants to introduce themselves. Often, participants will at least know each other’s names and functions, but it’s not uncommon for team members to be meeting each other for the first time during the tabletop exercises. Because these exercises are performed in part to ensure that all participants are familiar with each other’s roles and responsibilities, time spent on introductions is worthwhile.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Dedicate no more than two or three slides to introductions. Depending on the size of the group and relationships between attendees, 5 to 10 minutes should suffice.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec25">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec25"><span id="h-80"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">The Preamble</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">The facilitator should cover several topics in the preamble, including the purpose of tabletop exercises, proper etiquette, the importance of participation, and the expected outcome. The facilitator should also introduce the concept of injects. If this is the organization’s first exercise, or if there are many first-time participants, setting an expectation prior to moving into the actual scenario can ensure that all participants are on the same page.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">If the executive sponsor is attending the tabletop exercise, the preamble is an opportunity for them to say a few words that reinforce the importance of the exercise, thank everyone for participating, and emphasize that they’re looking forward to understanding how the organization can improve after identifying gaps. The executive sponsor might also provide these words of encouragement during the introduction.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_75" aria-label="75"/>Be mindful that the elements of the preamble have the potential to steal precious time from the exercise itself. Ideally, the preamble should take no more than 15 minutes, leaving the bulk of the allotted time to the exercise.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Let’s look at the components of the preamble in more detail.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec26">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec26"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Define the Rationale for the Exercise</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">It’s very possible that several participants are questioning the value of performing a tabletop exercise. A brief slide and a few words from the facilitator can highlight its benefits, as you can see in <a href="#fig3-6">Figure 3-6</a>.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img id="fig3-6" class="img100" src="../images/pg75.jpg" alt="" width="1391" height="785"/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 3-6: A slide explaining the purpose of a tabletop exercise</span></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">At a minimum, the slide should clarify that tabletop exercises help prepare the organization for a cybersecurity incident, identify gaps in existing processes, and educate response team members about their roles during a cybersecurity incident.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec27">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec27"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Establish Proper Etiquette for the Tabletop</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Dedicate a slide or two to tabletop exercise etiquette. There’s a good chance that participants are wondering what to expect over the next two hours. Will it be adversarial? How can they contribute? What is expected of them? These are fair questions and may generate a certain amount of confusion.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">It’s also very possible that a participant may want to defend an organization from the weaknesses presented in the scenario. Put yourself in the shoes of a system administrator hearing, in a tabletop exercise, that an internet-facing system had services enabled with default usernames and passwords. The sysadmin might immediately jump in to explain how there are policies, system build processes, regular external penetration testing, and other various checks to prevent such a situation from occurring.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_76" aria-label="76"/>The facilitator can avoid some of this defensive behavior by taking the time to briefly discuss how the scenario was developed. This can help eliminate the perception that it was created by an overcaffeinated risk management professional letting their imagination run wild. A slide such as the one in <a href="#fig3-7">Figure 3-7</a> can help head off objections and speculation about the development process.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img id="fig3-7" class="img100" src="../images/pg76.jpg" alt="" width="1390" height="777"/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 3-7: A slide introducing tabletop etiquette for a sample exercise</span></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">This slide emphasizes that this tabletop exercise has taken some creative liberties and asks participants not to fight the narrative. Acknowledging these two points should reduce or eliminate resistance when participants start to process the scenario.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec28">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec28"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Encourage Participation</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">It is also important to request that all attendees participate in the discussions. Tabletops are most effective when a large number of participants are engaged, contribute points and counterpoints, and tactfully question decisions or processes.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Encourage each attendee to discuss their <i>individual</i> interests or those related to their function. For example, representatives from legal may have very different concerns than those from business continuity. Consider the following brief exchange between representatives from information security and finance regarding calling a vendor for emergency support:</p>&#13;
<p class="UL"><b>Information security:</b> If it became that bad, we would just call in our vendor for incident response support.</p>&#13;
<p class="UL"><b>Finance:</b> Wait, do we have contracts in place with the vendor? I thought we let the contract lapse. And what will that run us?</p>&#13;
<p class="UL"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_77" aria-label="77"/><b>Information security:</b> We would have to get them signed quickly. And it won’t be cheap. I would be surprised if we got away with anything less than a $50,000 bill.</p>&#13;
<p class="UL"><b>Finance:</b> Obviously, if we need to pull them in, then we need to pull them in. But we have a hard-and-fast policy that all contracts over $25,000 need to be reviewed by legal and procurement. I have never seen a review escape legal faster than 48 hours.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Clearly, both information security and finance have the same goal: to address a cybersecurity incident. However, they each bring up salient points relevant to their individual functions, enabling the other party to understand potential hurdles they would need to confront during an incident.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">A slide like the one in <a href="#fig3-8">Figure 3-8</a> can help foster the spirit of participation.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img id="fig3-8" class="img100" src="../images/pg77.jpg" alt="" width="1391" height="786"/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 3-8: A slide encouraging participation in a sample tabletop exercise</span></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">A tabletop in which few attendees speak will only cause a malaise to slowly fill the room, diminishing the value of the event.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec29">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec29"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Convey Intended Outcomes</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Prior to digging into the scenario, all participants should understand the intended output of the tabletop exercise. You can accomplish this with a short slide and accompanying discussion (<a href="#fig3-9">Figure 3-9</a>).</p>&#13;
<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_78" aria-label="78"/>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img id="fig3-9" class="img100" src="../images/pg78.jpg" alt="" width="1390" height="785"/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 3-9: A slide discussing expected outcomes for a sample tabletop exercise</span></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">Most often, the output of a tabletop is a report listing recommendations and identified opportunities for improvement. These may range from recognizing that key stakeholders weren’t notified in a timely manner to addressing a lack of clarity over what resources are available to the organization via its cyber insurance policy. <span class="Xref1"><a href="chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a></span> covers the specifics of reporting.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Potentially most important is describing to participants what <i>won’t</i> happen. Even if you assured them otherwise before the exercise, some attendees may still believe that they’re being personally evaluated, causing them to be overly defensive or withdrawn. For example, if management has indicated that certain business units are a financial drain or lower priority, an attendee from one of these groups may feel the need to grandstand to demonstrate their value. Thus, emphasize before starting that the goal of the tabletop exercise is not to evaluate individual responses and that you won’t assign grades or point out individual failures.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Before moving on, make sure that participants don’t have any lingering questions. Once those are addressed, you’re ready to begin the exercise.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;

<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec30">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec30"><span id="h-81"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Injects and Exercise Discussions</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">With the etiquette and ground rules covered, you can now design the core portion of the tabletop: the inject slides. If you’ve developed a storyboard or ground truth document, you can easily identify the number of slides you’ll need to convey the events of the incident.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_79" aria-label="79"/>We recommend including the following components on each inject slide:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b>Date and timestamps</b> These show the timing of the particular inject.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b>The injects</b> In some cases, you will want to display all information on the slide at once, whereas for other scenarios you may wish to reveal certain details as the discussion unfolds. As previously mentioned, this should be as short as possible, not a dissertation.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b>Imagery</b> While you won’t always need an image to tell the story, graphics can often communicate details. As an example, for a ransomware-based scenario, adding a doctored ransom note from an actual ransomware variant can be an eye-opener.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="TX">Optionally, and helpful for a novice facilitator, you can follow up each inject slide with prewritten questions to keep the tabletop exercise on track. Consider the inject and its prewritten questions in the following box.</p>&#13;
<aside class="box1" aria-labelledby="box-11">&#13;
<h5 class="BT" id="box-11"><span class="SANS_Dogma_OT_Bold_B_11">INJECT</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">A media representative from BSNews is inquiring about a PII data leak affecting customer data and has requested comment prior to going on air during the 5</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_SC_11">PM</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">news segment.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BBLH"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Heavy_B_11">Questions</span></p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Would every employee who received a call from the news outlet know whom to direct the call to?</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Who is responsible for responding?</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">What would be said?</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Do we have a prewritten template that can be used?</span></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
</aside>&#13;
<p class="TX">This example asks the participants to answer these questions while also elaborating on other response efforts related to media communications.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">If you include prewritten questions on the slide, always configure the presentation software to present only one at a time. If you present several questions at once, participants may feel lost or skip a question in favor of one they believe is more important.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Depending on the audience, prewritten questions have the potential to stifle discussion. After hearing an acceptable answer, participants may feel compelled to wait for the next question instead of bringing forward a question or concern. Given this possibility, it may be ideal for the facilitator to avoid displaying prewritten questions on the screen and instead ask them verbally. The prewritten questions can be saved in the presentation software’s notes section, displayed on the side of the presenting computer’s screen.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_80" aria-label="80"/>We’ll revisit prewritten questions and how to use them during an exercise in <span class="Xref1"><a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a></span>.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec31"><span id="h-82"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">The Debrief</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">During this final phase, dedicate a slide or two to a debrief. This can be an open-ended discussion or a series of prewritten questions. Either way, you should review the people, processes, and technologies in place and whether the organization has the resources to handle an incident like the one rehearsed during the exercise. <span class="Xref1"><a href="chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a></span> will provide more guidance on how to most effectively perform a debrief after a tabletop exercise.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec32"><span id="h-83"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Inviting Feedback</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Now that you’re approaching the finish line of your tabletop exercise development, consider soliciting feedback from organizational or industry peers, such as those who weighed in on the scenario design process. They could offer avenues of exploration you hadn’t considered, enriching the exercise.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Keep in mind that if you share any organizational information with an outside party, whether it be policy documents or a PowerPoint deck, you need to adhere to the company’s information disclosure processes. Seek approval in writing from appropriate stakeholders before sending information to outside parties. For some organizations, sharing information externally is never acceptable; for others, sitting down with an industry peer over lunch and sharing your plan is perfectly acceptable with permission.</p>&#13;

<p class="TNI">Once you complete the steps described in this chapter, you should have the materials you’ll need to deliver the tabletop exercise. This means the development team has agreed on a relevant and realistic scenario and broken it into logical components via injects.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The next chapter discusses facilitation strategies to employ during the actual event. You’re almost there!</p>&#13;

<p class="TNI">In the development process, the rubber meets the road, as you’ll formulate ideas and narrow them down until you’ve drafted your scenario. When <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_81" aria-label="81"/>embarking on this process, answer the following questions before moving into the next phase:</p>&#13;
<ol class="NL">&#13;
<li class="NL" value="1">What is your process for selecting a topic? Once you have a list of potential topics, how will you narrow it down to your final choice? Likewise, what is the process for selecting a final scenario?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Is the final scenario realistic, relevant to the organization and to participants, and developed to account for known or potential weaknesses?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Are any injects focused on a particular function, such as legal?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Do the injects have the desired and appropriate escalation pace?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">How do you intend to encourage participation in the tabletop exercise?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Will an educational briefing prior to the tabletop exercise be valuable to the participants?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Who in the organization might be able to review the storyboard and provide critical feedback? Could you ask industry peers to review the tabletop exercise materials?</li>&#13;

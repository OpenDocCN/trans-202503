			</header>
			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="443"/>You can use Inkscape to create technical drawings, too. Inkscape is not a CAD (computer-aided design) application, 
but it works very well for moderately complex technical drawings. 
If you already know how to use Inkscape, using it for this kind of work is a logical choice. 
As an example, let’s draw an isometric image of an engine part’s cross-section (<a href="#fig24-13">Figure 24-13</a>).</p>
			<p>
				The key to creating technical drawings in Inkscape is the use of grids (<a href="c07.xhtml#section7.2">7.2</a>),
snapping (<a href="c07.xhtml#section7.3">7.3</a>), transforming by numbers (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.6">6.6</a>), and shapes, especially rectangles
(<a href="c11.xhtml#section11.2">11.2</a>). Those features allow you to create a 3D view of a complex piece quickly and precisely, without ever having to approximate or adjust anything by hand.
Every object, handle, and node just snaps into its exact place. Once you get the hang of it, producing such drawings will be almost addictively easy.</p>
			<a id="section24.1"/><h2>24.1 Setting Up the Grid</h2>
			<p>
				An <em>isometric</em> image is one where all three coordinate axes are
separated by equal angles (60 degrees) and have the same scale. For example, in an isometric cube, 
all visible edges have the same length.</p>
			<p><a id="444"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_444" title="444"/>To start a grid to create the engine part drawing, open the <span class="ui"><strong>Document Properties</strong></span> dialog (<a href="c07.xhtml#section7.2.1">7.2.1</a>), choose the <span class="ui"><strong>Grids</strong></span> tab, and create the
default axonometric grid with both X and Z angles set to 30 degrees (measured from the
horizontal), as shown in <a href="#fig24-1">Figure 24-1</a>. You may want to set the <span class="ui">Spacing Y</span> (the grid being isometric, it applies all three axes) to the minimum measurable distance in your drawing.
For example, if all dimensions in your drawing are in millimeters and precise to the first fractional digit,
set the grid spacing to 0.1 mm so you never have to place anything in between grid lines.</p>

				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 24-1: Setting up the isometric grid</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>You can also change the major (darker) grid lines’ spacing; by default, they appear every five regular lines. When you zoom out, the regular grid lines disappear first.</p>
			<a id="section24.2"/>
			<h2>24.2 Making the Box</h2>
			<p>
				Let's create the object’s bottom box. With the grid (and, by default, snapping to grid) on, use the Rectangle tool to draw a rectangle—any rectangle. Notice that the corners of the rectangle 
snap to the grid line intersections (pay attention to the snap indicator and tips, <a href="c07.xhtml#section7.3.2">7.3.2</a>), but the rectangle is not isometric.</p>
			<p>
				To skew it into the isometric projections, open
the <span class="ui"><strong>Transform</strong></span> dialog (Shift-Ctrl-M, <a href="c06.xhtml#section6.7">6.7</a>), and on the <span class="ui"><strong>Skew</strong></span>
tab, specify 60 degrees for <span class="ui"><strong>Horizontal</strong></span> skew and 30 degrees for<span class="ui"><strong>Vertical</strong></span> skew. After you click <span class="ui"><strong>Apply</strong></span>, the rectangle transforms to fit the grid;
note that the rectangle’s resize handles now also move in the isometric projection (<a href="c11.xhtml#section11.2.1">11.2.1</a>). Now, all you need to do is snap them
to the corresponding grid intersections, as <a href="#fig24-2">Figure 24-2</a> demonstrates.</p>
			<a id="fig24-2"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t06-02.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 24-2: Creating, skewing, and snapping the top of the box</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="445"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_445" title="445"/>The box’s other two sides are even easier to create. For the front side, you
need only 30 degrees of <span class="ui">Vertical</span> skew, with <span class="ui">Horizontal</span> skew set at 0. The left side of the box is
simply the front side duplicated (Ctrl-D) and flipped (H). After
skewing and flipping, snapping the corners of all three rectangles to form a precise, solid, gapless
6×8×2 box is super easy. The X and Z units need to be an even number,
so that the two grid lines intersect in the center of the top side (<a href="#fig24-3">Figure 24-3</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig24-3"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t06-03.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 24-3: Creating the front and left sides of the box</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Now that you have one box, you can quickly build up complex architectures by
duplicating its sides and re-snapping the corners to new positions. However, this
is not what we are going to do; the next step is rounding the box’s corners.</p>
			<a id="section24.3"/><h2>24.3 Rounding Corners</h2>
			<p>
				To round a rectangle’s corners (<a href="c11.xhtml#section11.2.2">11.2.2</a>), grab the
circular handle on a corner and drag it along the side. In the double-skewed top side of the box,
rounding works as expected; the rectangle becomes rounded in its plane with appropriate projective distortion. While
Ctrl-dragging one of the rounding handles, snap it to the nearest intersection so that the rounding radius is equal to one grid unit. Then, on the front and left sides,
move the sizing handles to make them narrower by one grid unit on each side (<a href="#fig24-4">Figure 24-4</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig24-4"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t06-04.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 24-4: Rounding the corners on top of the box</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>To fill the gaps in the box’s corners, create a vertical cylinder and put copies (or clones) in all three
of the box’s visible corners. You’ll also reuse it for the top cylinder of the engine part.</p>
			<p>
				To make a cylinder, start with an ellipse, but you don't even need the Ellipse tool to make it.
Instead, just duplicate the box’s top side and
resize it to an isometric square of 2×2 grid units. Since resizing preserves the
rounded corners, each with the radius of one unit, this produces a perfectly isometric
ellipse (<a href="#fig24-5">Figure 24-5</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig24-5"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t06-05.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 24-5: Creating an ellipse out of a rectangle</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="446"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_446" title="446"/>To create a cylinder, you could duplicate this ellipse, move it down, and draw a flat
non-isometric rectangle between them. Although workable, this method isn’t “clean,” because
the ellipses’ extremities have no grid lines to which to snap the rectangle’s left and right edges.
Such an approach requires turning off snapping and using manual tweaking with its inevitable
speed/precision tradeoff. Let's try another method.</p>
			<p>
				Convert a copy of this ellipse-like rectangle to path (Shift-Ctrl-C)
and switch to the Node tool (F2). You will see what looks like four nodes on the path—but
in fact there are eight: each visible node is actually two nodes, contributed by the two rounding arcs that meet there.
To fix this, drag-select around each of these duplicate nodes in turn (the status bar should say <em>2 of 8 nodes selected</em>)
and click the <span class="ui"><strong>Join selected nodes</strong></span> button on the Node tool's controls bar. Do this four times, so you end up with a path of four nodes.</p>
			<p>
				However, the ellipse’s left and right extremities don’t have nodes where you’ll need them. 
Select all
nodes (Ctrl-A) and insert new nodes between each of the two selected nodes by
pressing Insert (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5.3">12.5.3</a>), as shown in <a href="#fig24-6">Figure 24-6</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig24-6"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t06-06.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 24-6: Adding nodes at the ellipse’s extremities</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Now, select only the two nodes at the horizontal extremities (marked <em>left</em> and <em>right</em>
in <a href="#fig24-6">Figure 24-6</a>) and duplicate them (Shift-D). Add the three nodes in the bottom half of the 
ellipse to the selection by dragging around them with Shift. Grab the node that
is tangent to the grid line (marked <em>tangent</em>) and Ctrl-drag it and the rest of
the selected nodes downward until it all snaps at a level two units lower, creating the
ideally precise cylinder outline. After that, all you need to do is add a copy of the
original ellipse back into its place on top, and draw a horizontal gradient (<a href="#fig24-7">Figure 24-7</a>).</p>

			<p><a id="447"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_447" title="447"/>Group the cylinder, create three copies of it, and move each one to fill a gap in the rounded box. The cylinders
will fit snugly into their places. To make the box look solid, just sort out the z-order and match the colors,
as shown in <a href="#fig24-8">Figure 24-8</a>. Use the Dropper tool (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.8">8.8</a>) to
copy colors from the flat sides to the gradient stops on the cylinders (or vice versa).</p>

			<h2>24.4 Making the Top Cylinder</h2>
			<p>To create the top cylinder, make another copy of the corner cylinder and scale it up twice by pressing
Ctrl-&gt;, then snap it into place on top of the center of the box.</p>
			<p>
				Duplicate the top ellipse and scale it down to 50 percent in place
(Ctrl-&lt;). Now, you don't even need to move it; it's
already precisely where it must be to imitate the hole in the top cylinder. All you need
to do is make it <em>look</em> like a hole by adding a horizontal linear gradient in the opposite direction of the cylinder.
While you're at it, make three more
copies of the hole, snap each one into the base box’s corners, and scale down by pressing
Ctrl-&lt; again. These will be the holes for the bolts to fasten the detail in
place, as shown in <a href="#fig24-9">Figure 24-9</a>.</p>

				24.5 <a id="448"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_448" title="448"/>Making the Cutout</h2>
			<p>A full isometric view of the object is now ready. To demonstrate some
additional techniques, let's create a cutout of the object showing two
perpendicular cross-sections.</p>
			<p>
				Since everything you’ve done so far is snapped to the grid, adding the cutout shape is
very easy. Switch to the Pen tool (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.1.1">14.1.1</a>) and click near the correct grid intersections
to create a closed path for the left side of the cross section. Then, while pressing Shift, create a second
subpath of the same path, clicking through the right side’s corners (<a href="#fig24-10">Figure 24-10</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig24-10"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t06-10.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 24-10: Adding the cutout shape</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Cutouts in technical designs are often filled with a pattern symbolizing the object’s material.
Plain stripes are used for metals, and you can use one of the preset patterns to indicate that an object is metallic.
Open the <span class="ui"><strong>Fill and Stroke</strong></span> dialog
(<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.2">8.2</a>), click the <span class="ui"><strong>Pattern</strong></span> button on the <span class="ui"><strong>Fill</strong></span> tab, and choose the <span class="ui"><strong>Stripes 1:8</strong></span>
pattern. The problem with this pattern is that it shows black stripes on a
transparent background, and you need black stripes on a white background. Just duplicate the shape, paint it
white, and move the white copy under the striped one in the z-order (<a href="#fig24-11">Figure 24-11</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig24-11"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t06-11.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 24-11: Painting the stripes</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Now you need to remove the parts of the object in front of the cutout. Select and
delete the frontmost rounded cylinder. Using the rectangle resize handles, contract the
the box’s right and left sides to snap them to the cutout’s edges. As for the rest of
the objects—the top side of the box and the top ellipse of the cylinder—you’ll actually need to <em>cut</em> them.</p>
			<p>
				Again using the Pen tool, snap-draw a triangle covering the area you want to cut out. Subtract this triangle from the shape
by selecting both and pressing Ctrl-–, <a href="c12.xhtml#section12.2">12.2</a>), as shown in <a href="#fig24-12">Figure 24-12</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig24-12"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t06-12.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 24-12: Cutting out unnecessary pieces</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="449"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_449" title="449"/>Now, create the inside of the hole visible through the cutout.
Duplicate the cylinder shape, scale it down (Ctrl-&lt;), and step it down in
the z-order so it's under the cutout shape and the hole ellipse. This will be the hole’s inner surface.
Using the Node tool, select and pull down that shape’s bottom nodes. 
Then, duplicate the hole ellipse, move it down to the level of the bottom edge, and subtract it from the inner surface shape.</p>
			<p>
				Finally, you need to paint the inner surface.
Select the ellipse at the top of the hole and copy it to the
clipboard (Ctrl-C). Then, select the inner surface path and paste the style to it
(Shift-Ctrl-V). This will paint the inverted horizontal gradient of the top ellipse on the entire inner
surface of the hole, as shown in <a href="#fig24-13">Figure 24-13</a>.</p>

<h1 class="ChapterTitle"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"/>Making Sense of the Computer Science Standards</h1>&#13;
</header>&#13;
<p class="ChapterIntroFirst">Throughout this book, we’ll explore fun and engaging ways of teaching computer science to K–12 students. Although having fun is key to engaging students with the content, we need to make sure we’re teaching students the core concepts that will prepare them for college and the professional world so they can thrive in the Information Age. </p>&#13;
<p class="ChapterIntroNext">This chapter reviews and summarizes the different computer science standards adopted in the United States and by international educational organizations, such as the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA). To make sense of the many computer science standards, the concepts are grouped into four easy-to-remember domains. Use these guidelines to craft lessons for your students that blend existing subject matter with computer science concepts to enrich each student’s learning experience.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Keep in mind that debate continues over the value of teaching computer science standards in public schools. In fact, numerous headlines in the media question whether coding is the new literacy. In response, Jeff Attwood, co-founder of Stack Overflow, a forum for finding solutions to almost any programming problem, argues that computer science shouldn’t be taught in schools because it’s not so much an intellectual discipline as it is a vocational skill, like being an auto mechanic. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">We can see this purely utilitarian view of computer science reflected in previous attempts to bring information technologies into schools. For example, technology purchases, like computer labs, are based on the productivity enhancements the technology is believed to provide, such as training software and spreadsheets, rather than understanding the technology and its implications. Fortunately, recent developments in computer science education are making computer science a broad, culturally rich discipline that extends far beyond writing code.</p>&#13;
<h2 class="HeadA"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"/>Computer Science Standards in K–12 Schools</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Computer science infuses every aspect of our lives in the Information Age, but progress bringing it into our classrooms has been slow. Unfortunately, many students aren’t getting the exposure they need to computer science concepts that can help them succeed in the modern professional world. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">In 2010, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) released an exhaustive report, <em class="EmphasisItalic">Running on Empty: The Failure to Teach K-12 Computer Science in the Digital Age,</em> on how US states were incorporating computer science standards in the classroom. It was disheartening. Only nine states allowed computer science courses to count toward graduation credit, and only 14 states had adopted computer science instruction to a significant degree. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">In addition, computer science curricula focused primarily on computing skills rather than foundational concepts. In other words, schools were relegating computer science to a vocational skill instead of a broader discipline that teaches valuable concepts, such as computational thinking, information systems, and digital citizenship.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Similarly, an April 2013 joint report by Informatics Europe and the ACM Europe Working Group on Informatics<em class="EmphasisItalic"> </em><em class="EmphasisItalic">Education, </em><em class="EmphasisItalic">Informatics education: Europe cannot afford to miss the boat,</em> stressed the need for European citizens to be educated in <em class="EmphasisItalic">digital literacy</em>, fluency with computers and the internet, and <em class="EmphasisItalic">informatics</em>, the science of information technology (similar to computer science but more focused on information than digital computation). Failure to clearly define an informatics curriculum, provide teacher training, and offer students obligatory classes in the subject, the report argued, harmed students by failing to prepare them for the modern workforce. It also put the European economy at risk of falling behind more competitive countries.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Fortunately, institutions are creating standards to more meaningfully integrate computer science into the curriculum. In the following subsections, we’ll look at some example standards educators can learn from: the K–12 Computer Science Framework (<a href="https://k12cs.org/"><em class="EmphasisItalic">https://k12cs.org/</em></a>), the CSTA K–12 Computer Science Standards (<a href="https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards"><em class="EmphasisItalic">https://www.csteachers.org /page/standards</em></a><em class="EmphasisItalic">/</em>), and the International Society for Technology in Education’s (ISTE) role-based standards (<a href="https://www.iste.org/standards"><em class="EmphasisItalic">https://www.iste.org/standards</em></a><em class="EmphasisItalic">/</em>). Additionally, we’ll look at the Nevada (<a href="http://www.doe.nv.gov/Nevada_Academic_Standards/Computer_Science"><em class="EmphasisItalic">http://www.doe.nv.gov/Nevada_Academic_Standards/Computer_Science</em></a><em class="EmphasisItalic">/</em>) and Virginia Department of Education (NDOE and VDOE) standards (<a href="http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/computer-science/"><em class="EmphasisItalic">http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/computer-science/</em></a>), which cross-reference computer science facets with other subjects, such as mathematics, social studies, and the sciences.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>K–12 Computer Science Framework and K–12 Computer Science Standards </h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In 2016, a collaboration of computer science educational organizations and US states developed the <em class="EmphasisItalic">K–12 Computer Science Framework</em>, which provides a vision and detailed explanation of what computer science education should encompass. In 2017, the CSTA released an update to its <em class="EmphasisItalic">K–12 Computer Science Standards</em> that builds on the K–12 Computer Science Framework. The update provides a streamlined set of standards outlining what students should know at each stage in their schooling. Educators who want to know what to teach their students at each grade level should consult the CSTA Standards. Those looking for a more detailed understanding of each subject in computer science should read the Framework.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>International Society for Technology in Education Standards</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Another noteworthy set of standards comes from the ISTE. Composed of six sets of standards, the guidelines are high-level enough to fit on both sides of one printed page, and they align well with the K–12 Computer Science Framework. Notably, the ISTE standards are role based: each one targets the role of a person in the educational system. Whether that person is an administrator, computer science educator, educator in another subject, technology coach, education leader, or student, the ISTE standards explain what each role should learn, teach, and lead in an organization.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>Virginia Department of Education Standards</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In November 2017 and June 2018, the VDOE and the NDOE, respectively, released their computer science standards. Like the standards set in other US states, these standards are informed by the K–12 Computer Science Framework and the CSTA’s standards. But the Virginia and Nevada standards are exceptional in that they directly tie as many of the computer science standards as possible to existing literacy, mathematics, history, and science standards. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">For example, third-grade teachers can connect a math lesson on repeating patterns to also cover algorithms incorporating loops. Algorithm analysis ties into mathematical problem-solving and English comprehension. Basic set theory can correlate to a science lesson on classifying objects. Using computers to get data, draw conclusions, and make predictions supports history and social studies requirements for students to use evidence to provide answers to questions. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">When you’re considering which standards to adopt in your classroom, start with your own state’s computer science standards. If your state hasn’t officially adopted standards or if its existing standards are lacking, follow the CSTA’s standards. If you need more depth, explore the K–12 Computer Science Framework. If you need direction to implement computer science at your educational institution, use the ISTE standards as your guide.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Conceptually, the many sources for educational standards can be overwhelming and difficult to keep track of. In the next section, we’ll review how to compartmentalize these topics within four primary themes that are easy to remember and implement.</p>&#13;
<h2 class="HeadA"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Four Categories of Computer Science Standards</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Whichever set of standards best fits your needs, you’ll find a huge range of concepts to cover. To help keep track of every topic you need to cover in computer science, you can think about the standards using four main categories: digital citizenship, computer systems, computational thinking, and computational artifacts, as shown in Table 1-1. </p>&#13;

<p class="Body">As we explore each of these broad areas, keep in mind that they’re not silos. Just as computer science integrates with math, English, science, history, and social studies, these subsets of computer science are deeply interwoven with one another.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>Digital Citizenship</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">So much of our students’ lives is now digital. They inhabit many diverse online communities. Just as we prepare students to succeed as citizens in the physical world, we must educate students about the opportunities, ethics, and dangers of the online world. We must raise them to be digital citizens. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Becoming a digital citizen means collaborating with people all over the world. It involves the interpersonal skills they need to work on projects together and to recognize the importance of human capital that makes all modern conveniences possible. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Students should learn how local and international law governs their digital lives in respect to information freedom, copyright restrictions, online privacy, and other dimensions. It’s important to learn about the ethical use of computers and how some behaviors can be legal but unethical. For example, some forms of online harassment and bullying carry profound personal consequences for those involved. Students who are good digital citizens will recognize the societal impacts of technology and potential impacts of new technologies.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Learning about digital citizenship can also open your students’ eyes to global inequities as they relate to information systems. What does it mean for some to lack access to computers connected to the internet? Why is it essential that information systems be accessible to blind and deaf users? It’s important to recognize and appreciate how good so many of us have it so we’re motivated to protect what we have and expand it to others.</p>&#13;

<section class="feature1">&#13;
<h2 class="BoxHead">The Global Village</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">To expand your students’ global awareness, try asking them this fun question: who makes the applications they use in their daily lives?</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Obviously, programmers develop the app. Teams of people spend hundreds and even thousands of hours coding the app. Teams of artists give it an appealing interface. Quality assurance (QA) testers methodically push every button and try to break every form input probing for bugs. Producers fund the project. Human resources personnel make sure everyone gets paid. Project managers coordinate all the moving parts, and distributors get the application to your phone, computer, or console.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">Then students should consider the device the app runs on. The storage likely comes from one company, the processor from another, and the screen from yet another. The plastic molding, the rare metals, and other basic resources come from other sources as well. </p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Public works provides the electricity to power the devices, and people work to pay the electricity bills. An electrician runs the wiring, and carpenters frame the buildings that support the software company. </p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">What about all the professionals providing solutions to the providers supporting you? Who builds the cars they drive to work in? Who builds the roads? Who feeds them? Protects them? Invents their technologies? See how far you can extrapolate this topic until you hopefully encompass the whole world.</p>&#13;
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
</aside><h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Computer Systems</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Computer systems include cybersecurity, software, hardware, networking, and other aspects specific to information technologies, which are responsible for most computing tasks we perform. Familiarity with these technologies is what lets us navigate familiar menu systems, manipulate the mouse or touch pad, and read onscreen content. It’s also the area with the potential to frustrate us when we encounter unfamiliar user interfaces, cryptic error messages, or system failures. Every aspect of computer systems was once a frustration point for each of us and will be for our students as they hunt and peck letters on the keyboard, wrestle for fine motor mouse control, or fumble through reading the pop-up boxes confronting them. For students to work through these frustrations to develop fluency with computers, knowledge of computer systems should be a critical component in computer science education. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Additionally, proficiency with peripherals, software interfaces, operating systems, hardware, cybersecurity, and networking are marketable skills that every job in the knowledge industry fields requires of applicants. Making sure all students graduate with these practical foundational skills is a moral responsibility for educators.</p>&#13;
<aside epub:type="sidebar">&#13;
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
<section class="feature1">&#13;
<h2 class="BoxHead">Designing User Interfaces for Accessibility</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst"><em class="EmphasisItalicBox">Human-computer interactions (HCI)</em> is the study of how people interact with computers, including how successful various computer interfaces are at meeting human needs. When our interfaces are well designed, we hardly notice them. The computer serves as a natural extension of ourselves in a phenomenon known as <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">kinesthetic projection</em>. But when the “E” on our keyboard sticks or we can’t find a setting in the menu, the computer becomes a source of frustration, an obstacle.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Consider the frustrations for users with disabilities. Accessibility lead Karen Stevens at EA Sports, a publisher of sports video games, was surprised to discover that a significant number of blind gamers were enjoying the company’s football, hockey, and racing games. For example, they used stereo sound to follow other racing cars to memorize track layouts. Using the announcer’s play-by-play game descriptions, they could follow the action on the football and hockey fields. This discovery led to certain features, such as controller-vibration feedback, that improve their gaming experience. Being mindful of the diversity of user experience is important when developing interfaces.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">Experiencing how blind users interact with computers can get students out of their comfort zone and seeing computers in a new way. You can expose students to how the blind experience digital life in several ways. For a fully immersive experience, you can try installing open source screen-reader software, like NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA), and let students try to navigate blind. Studies find visually impaired people can listen to text at much higher speeds than sighted people. To sample the experience, try playing a public domain audiobook (like those offered for free at LibriVox) at two times, three times, and four times the speed. Reading becomes harder and harder to understand the faster the playback, but soon students will adapt to the faster speed.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">Also prompt your students to consider what UI improvements we can make for sighted users based on the unique perspective of the visually impaired. Are there times when users with sight might not be able to look at a user interface (for example, while driving)? What about improving efficiency? For ­example, if they could consume an audio book in half or a quarter of the time, how many more books could they listen to each month? What about creatively? Could they think of a concept for a video game without video, such as one based purely on sound?</p>&#13;
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
</aside><h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Computational Thinking</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In her landmark 2006 article, Jeannette M. Wing, head of the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon at the time, argued that there should be a course called “Ways to Think Like a Computer Scientist” available to non–computer science majors. This course would teach <em class="EmphasisItalic">computational thinking</em>, or the art of expressing problems and their solutions in ways a computer could execute. Teaching computational thinking simply reframes activities we’re already doing in our daily lives into the context of computer science concepts.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">For example, each routine in a child’s daily life, such as getting to the bus, paying attention in class, taking quizzes, choosing lunch, taking bathroom breaks, and doing homework, is an <em class="EmphasisItalic">algorithm</em>. An algorithm is a set of steps or rules that defines a process the student follows. They execute some algorithms in loops that iterate each weekday of the school year. Student lives are filled with algorithms: they execute tasks, such as answering a list of questions in a quiz, maximizing the number of rides down the slide during recess, or flipping through pages while reading a book. They execute all these operations at set times, like how a computer executes regularly scheduled tasks. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Students also manage collections of items and information in their personal lives, just like computers manage in data structures called <em class="EmphasisItalic">sets</em> and <em class="EmphasisItalic">arrays</em>. For example, they manage sets of textbooks, homework, or facts for their next exam. They maintain arrays of friends on social networks, digital media collections, and online conversations, executing the same fundamental operations of set theory that a database administrator uses to run reports.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">As students grow older, their computational thinking skills must grow to match life's increasingly complex challenges. For example, we form models based on data to reconstruct famous historical events or predict the outcomes of complex systems, like the weather. We execute sophisticated algorithms at four-way stop signs, when baking a cake, or while threading a cross-stitch needle. There’s a reason concepts like “building code,” “civil code,” “criminal code,” and “code of laws” all use the word <em class="EmphasisItalic">code</em>. In any board game, you’ll find modeling of subject matter, algorithms in the rules, variables, abstraction, controls, modularity, decomposition, inference, data representations, and debugging required to properly play them. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Not only does computational thinking allow for new insights and clear cognition, but it also helps us interact with our computers. Learning to communicate effectively in ways a computer can understand makes it easier to program a thermostat to save energy, schedule recurring events on a digital calendar, or successfully interact with an artificial intelligence assistant like Google, Siri, Alexa, or Cortana. In a world where computers are completely integrated in our daily lives, the ability to communicate with these obtuse, highly literal intellects is requisite.</p>&#13;
<aside epub:type="sidebar">&#13;
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
<section class="feature1">&#13;
<h2 class="BoxHead">Boolean Logic Facts Game</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Try using this computational thinking exercise that asks students to engage with the subject matter from multiple perspectives instead of memorizing facts.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">You’ll start by listing the facts on index cards. But first, you need to think about what attributes you can use to categorize this information. For example, species fall into taxonomic ranks and environments; literature has characters and settings; and history has countries, years, and famous figures. For this example, let’s use a simple sight word list, which young learners are challenged to read on sight, but you can categorize any list of facts. The exercise of recognizing classifiable attributes is a core part of deciding how to store them in an information system.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Once you have your list of facts and attributes, have your students query your set. Start with basic attribute queries. Ask them for the set of all two-letter sight words. What about the set of three-letter sight words? </p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Now add the words “or,” “and,” and “not” to the queries to increase the challenge. What is the set of words containing “a” <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">or</span> “e”? What is the set of sight words that are three letters long <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">and</span> contain “i”? What is the set of sight words <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">not</span> beginning with “a,” “e,” “i,” “o,” <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">or</span> “u”?</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Try reversing the exercise. Have students pair off: let one st<a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>udent craft a set of words according to a rule they’ve come up with in secret. Have the other student try to guess the rule based on what is included and excluded. The more complex a rule the setter can craft, the more challenging for the guesser. </p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Can you guess the rules for the sets in Figure 1-1? What rules define this Venn diagram?</p>&#13;
<figure>&#13;
<p class="AnchoredBoxGraphic"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="image/01_01.png"/></p>&#13;
<figcaption class="BoxCaption2">Figure 1-1: Venn diagram of sight words</figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Once your students get the hang of the exercise, without realizing it they’ll have a basic understanding of how to retrieve information from a database. <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">Structured Query Language (SQL)</em>, pronounced “sequel,” is a language used to select results from a database. It implements unions, intersections, and exclusions using <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">or</span>, <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">and</span>, <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">not</span>, and other operators to execute Boolean logic that outputs a desired set of data.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">For example, Listing 1-1 shows the SQL statements that use Boolean logic to produce Figure 1-1.</p>&#13;
<pre>-- Find all words containing 'e'&#13;
SELECT * FROM sightWords WHERE word LIKE '%e%';&#13;
&#13;
-- Find all three-letter words&#13;
SELECT * FROM sightWords WHERE LENGTH(word) = 3;&#13;
&#13;
-- Find all three-letter words containing 'e'&#13;
SELECT * FROM sightWords WHERE LENGTH(word) = 3 AND word LIKE '%e%';</pre>&#13;
<p class="BoxListing">Listing 1-1: SQL code to create the Venn diagram in Figure 1-1</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">For an added challenge, you can use a spreadsheet instead of the index cards. Put the facts in one column and then give students attributes in the columns that follow. Setting the data as a table, students can filter the rows based on the attributes in different columns.</p>&#13;
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
</aside><h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Computational Artifacts</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">A <em class="EmphasisItalic">computational artifact</em> is a computer program or other computational project that involves sustained inquiry, peer review, and iterative development but doesn’t always include computer programming.  </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">When developing artifacts, students learn about the project life cycle and start producing output. They learn to document and comment their code to communicate with computer and human collaborators. They also learn to test for quality assurance and debug their software when the program goes awry. As they code, they begin to appreciate how the three previous concepts they’ve learned so far come together.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">For example, as digital citizens, students should be able to collaborate with peers and know when to properly attribute other people’s contributions when they build upon ­others’ code. They should consider how accessible their software is for users with disabilities or clients running it in older environments, and incorporate feedback from their users to iteratively improve their projects. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">As proficient computer systems users, students start to understand the architecture and operating system in which their code executes. When using online applications, they demonstrate an understanding of how their software runs on the network and is received by clients on the web. We can also teach them to consider their application’s security and develop software ethically and responsibly.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Students can use their computational thinking tools to craft algorithms with variables, functions, loops, and conditionals, like <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">if-then</span> statements. They can go on to experiment and apply more advanced concepts, such as recursion and data types. They should be able to model problems and test their models when the code executes.</p>&#13;

<h2 class="BoxHead">Mandala Factor Finder</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">This <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM)</em> exercise blends concepts such as factors, geometry, computation, and art. Ask your students to start with a hexagon and write the numbers one through six in each corner, as shown in Figure 1-2. Prime numbers are bold in these examples.</p>&#13;
<figure><p class="AnchoredBoxGraphic"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" src="image/CitC01_02_numbermandela.png"/></p>&#13;
<figcaption class="BoxCaption2">Figure 1-2: Number Mandala seed</figcaption></figure>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">From this seed, ask students to continue counting up in concentric hexagons so the numbers radiate out on spokes, as shown in Figure 1-3.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">What number patterns can students find in this drawing? Where are all the factors of three? Where are the even numbers? The factors of five? The primes?</p>&#13;
<figure><p class="AnchoredBoxGraphic"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-3" src="image/CitC01_03_numbermandela.png"/></p>&#13;
<figcaption class="BoxCaption2">Figure 1-3: Number Mandala expanded from seed</figcaption></figure>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">Get a bit more creative. Color the primes and factors to make them pop. Or, try drawing lines between factors to create interesting shapes. You can also start with different seeds, such as pentagons, octagons, and dodecagons. At the end of the exercise, students should have a computational artifact they can hang on a wall to enjoy and remind them of the many patterns found in their spiral creation.</p>&#13;

</section>&#13;
</aside><p class="Body">So far, we’ve covered sources for computer science standards and given an overview of the different categories in which they fall. In addition to familiarity with the standards, educators must also advocate for implementing the standards at their organization. </p>&#13;
<h2 class="HeadA"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>The Importance of Stakeholder Buy-In for Implementing Standards</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Every information technology project has <em class="EmphasisItalic">stakeholders</em>, individuals who have a personal interest in the project, align with its goals, and want to see it succeed. When implementing computer science standards at your school, your stakeholders are your students, parents, and administrators. You’ll need all of them to take a vested interest in your program to see it grow and benefit your students.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">The failure of the now notorious Common Core state standards illustrates the importance of partnering with parents, students, and administrators to clarify why students are learning what they’re learning and how it will benefit student stakeholders. In 2008, governors and education commissioners in the United States launched an effort to standardize education across the country. This was a matter of equity. A student shouldn’t be denied the best possible education just because their parents live in a state that spends less money on schooling than other states. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">But when implemented, the Common Core standards introduced many new and unfamiliar exercises, especially in teaching mathematics, that appeared unnecessarily complex to parents who had grown up with more straightforward and utilitarian algorithms for problem-solving. Social media feeds became inundated with parents complaining about the standards. Figure 1-4 illustrates the number line, a common pain point of Common Core.</p>&#13;

<figcaption class="Caption">Figure 1-4: The number line, villain of the Common Core</figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="Body">Parents who had learned to treat this example as a simple equation 8 ÷ 2 = 4 were now asked to help their children step through this lengthier algorithm. This angst about Common Core math was even alluded to in the Disney film <em class="EmphasisItalic">Incredibles 2</em>: in the film, a 1960s superhero dad struggles to help his son with his homework but doesn’t understand the New Math technique being used. It mirrors the extent to which parents became frustrated by the Common Core’s novel approaches.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Figure 1-4 shows a number line, one of many innovative methods for teaching mathematics. In fact, it’s used in countries like Singapore, whose students consistently top global rankings in math and science performance. The Common Core standards adopted concepts like the number line to challenge students to think about mathematics in different ways. Rather than teaching children specific algorithms for solving math problems, the Common Core teaches children how to think like mathematicians and empowers them to be more adaptable to a rapidly changing world.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">It’s the kind of flexible and adaptive thinking most everyone would ideally support in the educational system. But for parents, their idealism is challenged when they’re confronted with unfamiliar concepts they don’t understand. The angst in reaction to change turned into a backlash against these new educational innovations and prompted a political response. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">School districts began removing the words “Common Core” from state standards to avoid triggering outrage among parents and politicians. A few states officially pulled out of the Common Core standards or rejected them. But the inside joke among educators was that the standards these states did adopt were almost the same.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">The genuine frustration many parents felt and continue to feel while helping their children with their homework isn’t a joke. Parents are a crucial support mechanism for students, and we need their buy-in when coaching their children through challenging lessons at home. Parents need to understand why their children are learning concepts they didn’t learn in school and why the standards are relevant. This is especially true when introducing entire new fields of study like computer science. It’s crucial to get stakeholders to buy into the importance of teaching computer science standards to successfully implement them.</p>&#13;

<h2 class="BoxHead">Skinner Boxes vs. Autonomous Learning</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Educational strategies are often a balance of teachers rewarding desired behaviors versus letting students explore their interests. This concept is frequently referred to as the debate between <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">behaviorist</em> and <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">constructivist</em> approaches to teaching. Ask your students to think about their passions. How does your favorite video game keep you playing? How does social media keep you scrolling or a favorite website make you keep clicking? What keeps you engaged with these platforms?</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Next, ask your students to consider how much of the system is based on the little rewards it gives them (such as leveling up, points, likes, shares, or novel information). How much autonomy does the system allow? Is your video game an open world, or are you on a set path? Are you genuinely interested in your friends’ posts, or are you checking in on how much they like yours? There are no right or wrong answers, but the exercises require them to think about how these systems influence them. This is called <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">metacognition</em>, thinking about how you think.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Then ask your students to think about their own learning. What are the rewards that motivate them? Where is their autonomy? How much of school is conditioning students to respond in a desired way, and how much is self-directed learning?</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">If games, social media, or other distractions are more engaging than school, how can you change students’ school experience to make it more immersive? Students should be partners in their learning. What personal strategies can they use to take ownership of their educational experience?</p>&#13;

</aside><p class="Body">In Chapters 8 and 10, we’ll cover projects that can bring parents into the learning process and services your computer science program can provide to make it invaluable to your school administration and your students’ future professional lives. With community building and outreach projects, you can provide visibility for your computer science program.</p>&#13;
<h2 class="HeadA"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Summary</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, we reviewed the many different sets of computer science standards, from those professional institutions have developed to standards that cross-reference other subjects, such as those implemented by the VDOE and NDOE. As educators, you can refer to your own state or country’s standards for the specifics you need to cover in the classroom and reference the CSTA’s standards when the local standards are still in development or don’t exist. Additionally, you can refer to the K–12 Computer Science Framework for a deeper dive into the standards and turn to the ISTE standards for role-based strategies for implementing standards at your institution.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">The four broad categories of computer science standards should make them easy to follow and discuss with other educators. Digital citizenship covers the socially conscious skills and subjects that today’s students need as they step into a future of accelerating change. Computer systems refer to understanding the hardware and software that students must adopt and master for success in the professional world. Computational thinking involves the cognitive and metacognitive skills necessary for interfacing with computers and adapting to a world of rapid, technology-driven change. Computational artifacts are the end product of applying all the skills learned in the other three categories: they allow students to create art, software, or other tangible products users can interact with.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">This chapter also touched on the importance of stakeholder buy-in and the difficult lesson of the Common Core state standards. If parents see their children become frustrated with lessons that even the parents don’t understand, they won’t be able to provide the support their children need at home. Students, parents, and other stakeholders need to know why students are learning what they’re learning and its relevance. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">In the next chapter, you’ll learn the many practical, cognitive, and educational benefits of studying computer science so you can better motivate your students and guide them to understand how computer science education can help them.</p>&#13;

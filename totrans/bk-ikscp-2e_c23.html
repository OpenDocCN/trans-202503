			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="437"/>Among vector editors, Inkscape is one of the best for sketching and freehand
drawing, thanks to its versatile Calligraphic pen tool (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.2">14.2</a>). Far from being geometrically perfect
and lifeless like other vector tools, the Calligraphic pen has 
character—but it is still a vector tool that produces always editable vector objects.</p>
			<p>In this tutorial, we'll go through the process of creating a simple drawing entirely
in Inkscape. I'll draw a funny, cartoon running horse that might be a
mascot or a comic character. I've always found it challenging to draw anything from
scratch, and I imagine many readers can sympathize. Yet with
Inkscape, I was able to make a drawing I actually liked.</p>
			<a id="section23.1"/><h2>23.1 The First Sketch</h2>
			<p>
				Start by switching to the Calligraphic pen tool and setting a <span class="ui"><strong>Width</strong></span> of 0.05 and
a <span class="ui"><strong>Thinning</strong></span> of 0.2 in the tool's controls bar (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.2">14.2</a>). If you have a graphics tablet,
enable the pen pressure for varying the stroke width (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.2.1.1">14.2.1.1</a>). The <span class="ui">Angle</span> and <span class="ui">Fixation</span>
parameters make sense only for calligraphy, not freehand drawing, so <a id="438"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_438" title="438"/>set the <span class="ui"><strong>Fixation</strong></span>
to 0—this effectively turns a fixed-angle pen into a round brush that has no
orientation (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.2.2">14.2.2</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Believe it or not, I've never drawn a horse before, and my first several strokes make this brutally
obvious. With a beginning like this, I imagine many would have been tempted (as was I) to give up immediately.
But patience and hard work pay off—especially in Inkscape. Just keep throwing strokes onto the canvas, undoing, tweaking, and stroking
again. Sooner or later, something not <em>entirely</em> awful will flash through the tangle of bad lines (<a href="#fig23-1">Figure 23-1</a>).</p>

				For most people, drawing objects requires visual aids. You may find it hard to
visualize on your own how a horse's body curves or which way the legs bend. I found that photos
of real horses were of little help; much more inspirational were stylized<em>drawings</em> of horses—where other, more capable artists have already done the hard
work of abstracting and amplifying the core equestrian features. A Google image
search will provide you with plenty of reference material. After much sketching, undoing, and emphasizing (by adding pen pressure), I had the sketch shown in <a href="#fig23-2">Figure 23-2</a>.</p>

				23.2 <a id="439"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_439" title="439"/>Inking</h2>
			<p>
				A traditional comic or cartoon artist's workflow has two main stages:<em>sketching</em> (typically with a pencil) and <em>inking</em> (with a pen) over the rough
sketch. You can follow the same process in Inkscape. As soon as the drawing looks more or less like a horse, start inking <em>over</em> it, on a new layer, to develop
it further. This way, you can amplify what is good in your sketch and 
build on that without the risk of destroying it with too much tweaking. Select all strokes
(Ctrl-A) and assign them an opacity of 0.05 so they become barely
visible; this effectively hides the thin strokes, making it easier to concentrate on the
bold ones. Then, lock this layer (using the lock toggle button in the status bar), create a
new one (<span class="ui"><strong>Layer<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Add Layer</strong></span>), and draw the same horse <em>again</em> using the
sketch as a guide, as shown in <a href="#fig23-3">Figure 23-3</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig23-3"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t05-3.svg.png"/>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Is this the same horse? Not quite. The horse in the first sketch looked like a real
horse—perhaps a bit too real. What we want is a cartoon, not photorealism. In cartoons,
creatures’ heads (especially the eyes) and feet (or hands or paws) are often enlarged, out of proportion.
In the first
inking layer, let's do just that: keep the body the same but enlarge the hooves and the
head, adding a pair of oversized cartoonish eyes (<a href="#fig23-4">Figure 23-4</a>).</p>

				23.3 <a id="440"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_440" title="440"/>Tweaking</h2>
			<p>
				A vector editor's unique advantage is that all strokes remain independent objects, which makes nudging, scaling, or rotating parts of a drawing easy. 
To make such adjustments on the horse drawing, with the Selector tool, drag around the leg or the head to select all its objects and use
either the mouse handles or the convenient keyboard shortcuts: Alt-arrows to
move, Alt-&lt; or Alt-&gt; to scale, or Alt-[ or
Alt-] to rotate. Often, you’ll make a good stroke but at a wrong scale or in the 
wrong location—instead of deleting, transform it to
fit. Even if it already looks acceptable, playing with a character’s limbs or facial features
can sometimes make it more expressive than you thought possible (<a href="#fig23-5">Figure 23-5</a>).</p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				You are not limited to just one inking layer. At any time, you can
hide the previous sketch layer, lock and fade out your current layer to make it a new
sketch, and create a new inking layer on top. With every such transition, a drawing usually will 
look less and less like a pencil sketch and more like an ink drawing
with smooth strokes and elaborate details. <a href="#fig23-6">Figure 23-6</a> shows my third inking attempt over
the previous sketch layers; making the head look like a horse rather than a hippopotamus was especially difficult.</p>

			<h2>23.4 Coloring and Smoothing</h2>
			<p>
				With the outline almost complete, start thinking about coloring the
drawing. Inkscape can emulate many different coloring styles. For example, you can
imitate a painting by overlaying many random calligraphic strokes and painting each one
with a different color and opacity (using the Tweak tool, <a href="c08.xhtml#section8.9.1">8.9.1</a>).</p>
			<p><a id="441"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_441" title="441"/>We will try something simpler and more traditional: a flat color fill with some lighting and shading overlays (white and black ellipses with
elliptic opacity gradients, <a href="c10.xhtml#section10.1.2">10.1.2</a>). Use the Paint bucket tool (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.3">14.3</a>) to create the interior shape; apply a little blur
to it (about 2 percent) for extra smoothness (<a href="#fig23-7">Figure 23-7</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig23-7"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t05-7.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 23-7: Coloring options</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Let's return to the outline (hide the coloring layer for now).
You can make it smoother and more attractive if you select all the strokes in part of the figure
(such as a leg or the head), union them (Ctrl-+), and press Ctrl-L a few times.
Performing those steps melts the sharp corners and welds the
joints for a much more natural and integrated look (<a href="#fig23-8">Figure 23-8</a>). Another useful trick is to make
all strokes thicker by pressing Alt-) to outset them and then pressing Alt-( to make them thinner
(<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.4">12.4</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig23-8"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t05-8.svg.png"/>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Multiple insets and outsets on a path have an effect similar
to simplification. Too much insetting may make some parts of a path disappear
altogether, but this is not necessarily bad—trust the overall impression and your
artistic sense.</p>
			<a id="section23.5"/><h2>23.5 Drawing Hair</h2>
			<p>
				For many new artists, drawing realistic-looking hair is hard. Striking the right balance between regularity and chaos, as well as between tidiness and
untidiness is critical for the impression your character will make. At this stage of the horse drawing,
the tail and especially the mane weren't impressive. I drew them over
and over, but all my attempts looked either too lumpy or too bushy (or both). I was finally able to produce a decent wavy hair by using a high value of<span class="ui">Tremor</span> (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.2.4">14.2.4</a>) in the Calligraphic pen (<a href="#fig23-9">Figure 23-9</a>).  Maximizing this
parameter makes the calligraphic brush strokes nicely blotchy and much more uniformly uneven than I was able to do manually.</p>
			<a id="fig23-9"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t05-9.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 23-9: Making the horse’s mane look more realistic</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="442"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_442" title="442"/>The last touch is to try some scaling, rotating, and skewing of the entire drawing,
which can sometimes cause significant improvements without needing to do much work.</p>
			<p>
				Overall, the result was
much better than I expected. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have been able to achieve this
level of quality by drawing on paper. Of course, you can do other styles of drawing with Inkscape; 
experiment to find the techniques that are most natural for
you. I have grown to especially like the Calligraphic pen with a high <span class="ui">Tremor</span> value, which provides
an almost "natural media" drawing tool, as shown in <a href="#fig23-10">Figure 23-10</a>.</p>

						While the best device for drawing on the computer is a graphics tablet (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.2.1.1">14.2.1.1</a>),
you can create decent Inkscape drawings with a mouse. A hand with a
mouse cannot move equally naturally in all directions; horizontal strokes are
usually easier than vertical strokes and much easier than diagonal ones. Rotating the canvas (<a href="c03.xhtml#section3.13">3.13</a>) is
indispensable when you're drawing or hatching with a mouse.</p>

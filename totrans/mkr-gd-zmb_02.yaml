    is called the current, and in electronics, the current is the amount of charge
    passing a point per second. The unit of measurement for current is the ampere,

    unlike a battery, which has one positive connection and one negative, an alternating
    current switches the polarity of its two leads between positive and negative at
    a rate of 60 times a second (in the United States) or 50 times per second (in

    increasing to a peak of over 150V and then down to below –150V. Clearly, this
    is more than 120V on either side of zero. The maximum and minimum are described
    as 120V because this amount of AC power provides the equivalent amount of power
    as 120V DC. This way of measuring AC voltage is called root mean square (RMS).

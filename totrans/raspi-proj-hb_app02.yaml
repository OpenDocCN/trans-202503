- en: This quick guide shows you how to identify different resistors. A resistor is
    a passive electrical component that creates resistance to the electrical flow,
    limiting the amount of current reaching a certain part of the circuit. In this
    book, you use resistors mainly to limit the amount of current reaching LEDs.

- en: Resistors usually have four bands. The first two digits represent the first
    two digits of the value. The third is a multiplier representing the number of
    zeros after the first two digits. The fourth is the tolerance of the resistance.

    kΩ. The tolerance is 5 percent, which means the resistance value may be between
    560 kΩ ± 5%, so between 532 kΩ and 588 kΩ. You don’t need to worry too much about
    the tolerance unless you’re using really sensitive components. For this book,
    resistors with 5 percent tolerance are fine to use.

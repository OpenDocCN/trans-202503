<p class="noindent">The Arduino is a small, inexpensive computer that can be programmed to control endless creations limited only by your imagination. As you’ll soon see, the Arduino can be used to make a whole host of projects, like a ghost detector, joystick-controlled laser, electronic die, laser trip wire alarm, motion sensor alarm, keypad entry system, and many others. All of these projects are easy to build and have one thing in common—they use the power of the Arduino.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the early 1980s, I picked up a great Penguin paperback titled something like <em>Gadgets and Gizmos</em>, hidden away in a local bookstore. The projects were simple ones like making a working lighthouse using flashlight bulbs and building a revolving display table using an old clock. The ideas in that book sparked my imagination, and I’ve been creating ever since.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">My curiosity led me to take apart various electrical items to experiment with and find out how they worked. I usually struggled to put them back together but amassed a good selection of components to tinker with. (This is a great way of gathering lots of parts, by the way.)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I remember wiring together a string of small flashlight bulbs to make floodlights for my Subbuteo table-top soccer game and creating a loudspeaker system to blast out music at the halftime break in a game. I even managed to extract some LEDs from a Star Wars toy, only to burn them out because I didn’t understand what a resistor was at the time. I used small motors, buzzers, and solar cells to create burglar alarms and super whizzy cars, and I burned out a few motors too!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">At roughly the same time (1983), Sinclair Research in the United Kingdom launched the ZX Spectrum 48k microcomputer, introducing home computing to the UK mass market. (The United States had its Commodore 64.) While intended as a serious computer, the ZX Spectrum inadvertently lent itself more to gaming due to its inclusion of the simple programming language BASIC. As a result, software houses sprouted in bedrooms across the country as people rushed to build games for the ZX.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xvii"/>This sparked my interest in programming, but at the time I couldn’t combine my two passions. Physical computing, where software and hardware react to the physical world, was around in the ’80s but confined to the realm of very high-end computing and robotics, way out of reach of most households. Now, some 30 years later, with the introduction of the Arduino, I find myself tinkering again with electronics, but this time I can use programming to bring the projects to life.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="introlev1sec01"><span class="red"><strong>THE ARDUINO REVOLUTION</strong></span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In simple terms, the Arduino is a small computer that can be programmed to connect and control various electronic parts. The Arduino has a number of pins that can be set as either <em>input</em>, which means they can receive data from items such as switches, buttons, and sensors, or <em>output</em>, which means they send data to control items such as motors, lights, and buzzers. This type of programmable development board is better known as a <em>microcontroller</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The Arduino project began in Ivrea, Italy, in 2005 with the goal of creating a device to control student-built interactive design projects that would be less expensive than other prototyping systems available at the time. Founders Massimo Banzi and David Cuartielles named the project after a local bar called Arduino (an Italian masculine first name meaning “strong friend”).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The Arduino board is composed of two main elements: the hardware, or microcontroller, which is the brain of the board, and the software that you’ll use to send your program to the brain. The software, called the Arduino <em>integrated development environment (IDE)</em>, is available free for download.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The IDE is a simple interface that runs on a computer running Windows, OS X, or Linux. You use the IDE to create a <em>sketch</em> (an Arduino program) that you then upload to the Arduino board using a PC and USB cable. The sketch tells the hardware what to do. I’ll go into both the hardware and software in more detail in the next couple of chapters.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The Arduino can be powered by batteries, USB, or an external power supply. Once the Arduino is programmed, it can be disconnected from your computer and will run independently using a power supply or batteries.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="introlev1sec02"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xviii"/><span class="red"><strong>ABOUT THIS BOOK</strong></span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">What was it that encouraged me to write this book? The Internet is bursting with tutorials, videos, and articles covering the Arduino and potential projects, but many lack detailed visuals or the code required to build these projects. Like the <em>Gizmos and Gadgets</em> book that inspired me many years ago, this book is intended to help you build simple projects that will inspire you to create your own contraptions using the skills and techniques that you’ll learn.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this book you’ll concentrate on creating your project on a breadboard. This is the best way to learn about how circuits work, because the connections are not permanent; if you make a mistake, you can just unplug the wire or component and try again. Each project has step-by-step instructions for connecting the main components, along with photographs to help you with layout. Tables are used in most projects for quick reference.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The projects will have a circuit diagram to show the connections clearly, like that in <a href="intro.xhtml#intfig01">Figure 1</a>. These have been created with the Fritzing program (<em><a href="http://www.fritzing.org/">http://www.fritzing.org/</a></em>), a free, open source program for creating visual schematics of your projects.</p>&#13;

<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f00-00.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Each project also has the code required to program your Arduino, so you don’t need to worry about learning to program before you begin. The early projects provide simple explanations of what’s happening in the code, to help you understand the process of programming enough to make your own modifications if you want to. If you don’t want to type all the code, you can download the programs from <em><a href="http://www.nostarch.com/arduinohandbook/">http://www.nostarch.com/arduinohandbook/</a></em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xix"/>The projects in this book begin with the basics and progress steadily to more complex designs. That said, this book won’t go deeply into electronics theory or programming, but I will give you a good starting point. I’ve written this book to teach you how to create your own gadgets. By giving you the technical know-how, I allow you to focus on the creative design element. The idea is that learning the function of circuits can open up your imagination to ways of using those circuits practically.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This book gives practical information so you can, for example, reference the pin connections and replicate them when needed in a different project. You can also combine projects to make more complicated and interesting gadgets.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A lot of Arduino books focus on the programming element, and that’s great for a certain kind of learning, but I think there is a place for plug-and-play electronics. By following the steps in the projects, you will learn as you go.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="introlev1sec03"><span class="red"><strong>ORGANIZATION OF THIS BOOK</strong></span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindentb">The book progresses from simple to more complex projects as follows to help you build your skills and learn about components:</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><a href="part01.xhtml#part01"><strong>Part I: LEDs</strong></a> You’ll start by learning how to control simple LEDs with buttons and variable resistors, and then combine components to build disco strobe lights, plant monitors to tell you when your plant needs watering, and even a ghost detector.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><a href="part02.xhtml#part02"><strong>Part II: Sound</strong></a> In this part, you’ll learn about the piezo buzzer, a very useful device that emits and can also detect sound. You’ll make music with the Arduino Melody, create a simple and fun memory game, and set up a secret code lock system that detects the volume of a knock.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><a href="part03.xhtml#part03"><strong>Part III: Servos</strong></a> These projects all use the servomotor, a small motor with an arm that can be used for a whole host of purposes. You’ll build a joystick-controlled laser and decode a remote control so you can move your servo with buttons on the remote.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><a href="part04.xhtml#part04"><strong>Part IV: LCDs</strong></a> The LCD screen is useful in lots of projects for displaying messages and results. In this part, you’ll learn how to set up an LCD screen, build a weather station to report conditions, and set up two games: a fortune teller and a reaction timer game.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><a href="part05.xhtml#part05"><strong>Part V: Numeric Counters</strong></a> You’ll use LED number displays in this part to build an electronic die and a rocket launcher countdown system that sets off a fuse.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xx"/><a href="part06.xhtml#part06"><strong>Part VI: Security</strong></a> These more complex projects will show you how to protect your space with trip wires and intruder trackers, motion sensors that trigger alarms or sentry missiles, and security systems that use keypads and card readers to keep unauthorized persons out.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><a href="part07.xhtml#part07"><strong>Part VII: Advanced</strong></a> In this final part, you’ll combine the Arduino with a matrix of lights to create the Rainbow Light Show. Then you’ll round off your skills by building your own Arduino to use in future projects.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentt">These projects don’t have to be built in order, so if you see something you like and feel confident enough to take it on, you can skip to it. I recommend you try out some of the earlier projects first, though, as you’ll find information there that’s useful for more complicated builds.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I’ve written the book that I was looking for but couldn’t find when I started out with the Arduino. I hope that you’ll enjoy reading and working through this book as much as I’ve enjoyed writing it.</p>&#13;

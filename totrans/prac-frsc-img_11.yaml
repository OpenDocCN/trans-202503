    forward you’ll continue to find it a helpful reference. Whether you’re a professional
    forensics practitioner or a student learning about forensics, this book aims to
    demonstrate fundamental concepts, show how things work, and provide a set of practical
    tool examples with the Linux command line.

- en: Many new forensic books focus on application-layer analysis, cloud forensics,
    mobile forensics, big data analytics, and other new and exciting areas. Traditional
    digital forensic acquisition and evidence preservation of storage media might
    seem less exciting by comparison, but it is still a fundamental function that
    new forensic investigators need to learn.

    storage media forensics. A lot of change continues to happen in this area, and
    we as a community need to keep up with the latest developments. This book is intended
    to be a resource that includes coverage of the latest changes in traditional storage
    media forensics.

- en: Clearly, not all of the examples, tools, and methods shown here are suitable
    for every professional forensic lab setting. Many open source forensic tools are
    a small software development effort undertaken by volunteers (sometimes just a
    single developer), and some are even abandoned software projects. These cannot
    easily compete with the products of larger commercial software companies. Nonetheless,
    even tools that are in experimental stages of development will provide you with
    an understanding of the problems and how the solutions might look. In addition,
    I encourage you to explore other tools and methods that might not be covered in
    this book— open source tools are continuously and rapidly changing, and for every
    tool and method shown here, there are alternatives that could achieve the same
    result.

- en: I was drawn into digital forensics and investigation because it’s a field where
    you’re always learning. The investigative process is learning—learning about how
    events in an incident transpired. The digital forensics process is learning—learning
    how technologies are interacting with each other and reconstructing a sequence
    of technological activity. Digital forensics research and development is learning—learning
    to develop new tools and methods to overcome challenges and to understand complex
    technology to advance the body of knowledge.

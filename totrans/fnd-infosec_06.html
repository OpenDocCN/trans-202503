<div class="imagel"><img alt="Image" src="../images/common.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In information security, external rules and regulations often govern your ability to collect information, pursue investigations, and monitor networks, among other activities. To comply with these rules, you can set requirements for protecting your organization, designing new systems and applications, deciding on how long to retain data, or encrypting or tokenizing sensitive data.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this chapter, I’ll outline some rules that might affect your organization and discuss how to ensure compliance to them.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec1">What Is Compliance?</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Simply put, <em>compliance</em> is your adherence to the rules and regulations that govern the information you handle and the industry within which you operate.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_80"/>A decade ago, most information security efforts followed only a few policies and a general mandate to keep attackers out. Regulations aimed at protecting data and consumers had loose definitions, and governing parties enforced them less strictly.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Today, laws and regulations are more stringent, in part because large breaches, such as the British Airways breach of 380,000 payment cards in August 2018,<a href="notes.xhtml#ch06fn1" id="kch06fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> put compliance issues under increased scrutiny. Modern regulations update and evolve constantly, creating a moving target for companies that need to comply with the rules.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In general, you measure compliance against the standard to which you’re adhering. In several industries, you may even have to comply with more than one set of rules. While you’ll rarely encounter contradictory sets of standards, you may find that they disagree on the specifics. For example, one set of compliance rules might specify a one-year retention period for server backups, while another might specify six months. When faced with these situations, you’ll likely find yourself adopting the strictest set of items across all compliance efforts, for the sake of simplicity.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Keep in mind that compliance isn’t the same thing as security. Even if you’ve put hundreds or thousands of hours toward complying with a specific set of rules and even if you’ve passed an audit, you may not be secure against attacks. You carry out compliance to meet the needs of specific third parties—namely, your customers or business partners, auditors, and the compliance bodies responsible for ensuring your compliance. Compliance fulfills a business need rather than any technical security need. Furthermore, you are “compliant” whenever these third parties are satisfied with your efforts—regardless of how well you’ve actually met the requirements. An organization will usually put their “best foot forward” when the inspector comes.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec1"><em>Types of Compliance</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">There are two main types of compliance: regulatory compliance and industry compliance.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Regulatory compliance</em> is your adherence to the laws specific to the industry in which you’re operating. In almost every case, regulatory compliance involves cyclical audits and assessments to ensure that you’re carrying everything out according to specification. Preparing for these audits can be a valuable part of a compliance program, as they can both educate participants and provide opportunities to find and fix issues.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Industry compliance</em> is adherence to regulations that aren’t mandated by law but that can nonetheless have severe impacts upon your ability to conduct business. For example, organizations that accept credit cards must typically comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), a set of rules created by a group of credit card issuers (including Visa, American Express, and Mastercard) for processing credit card transactions. The standard defines requirements for a security program, specific criteria for protecting data, and necessary security controls. Credit card issuers update the standard every few years to keep pace with current conditions and threats.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_81"/>Although these credit card issuers can’t legally enforce compliance with their standards, their mandate certainly has teeth. Merchants processing credit card transactions based on cards from PCI members must submit to yearly assessments of their security practices. Organizations with low numbers of transactions can simply complete a self-assessment consisting of a short questionnaire. As the number of transactions grows, however, the requirements become progressively stringent, culminating in visits by specially certified external assessors, mandated penetration tests, requirements for internal and external vulnerability scanning, and a great deal of other measures.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2"><em>Consequences of Noncompliance</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Noncompliance can trigger a variety of consequences, depending on the set of regulations in question.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the case of industry compliance, you may lose the privileges associated with being compliant. For instance, if you fail to comply with the PCI DSS regulations that govern processing credit card transactions and protecting associated data, you may face hefty fines or lose your merchant status and be unable to process further transactions. For a business that depends heavily on credit card transactions, such as a retail store, losing the ability to process credit cards could put them out of business.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the case of regulatory compliance, you may face even stiffer penalties, including incarceration for violating the laws in question.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec2">Achieving Compliance with Controls</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To comply with standards and regulatory requirements, you will typically implement physical, administrative, and technical controls.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3"><em>Types of Controls</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>Physical controls</em> mitigate risks to physical security. Examples include fences, guards, cameras, locked doors, and so on. These controls typically physically prevent or deter unauthorized access to or through specific areas.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Administrative controls</em> mitigate risks by implementing certain processes and procedures. Whenever you accept, avoid, or transfer risk, you’re likely using administrative controls because you’re putting processes, procedures, and standards in place to prevent your organization from hurting itself by taking on too much risk. You’ll also have to document your administrative controls by keeping records of policies, procedures, and standards you’ve put in place and providing evidence that your organization has followed them.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, almost every standard or regulation requires you to have an <em>information security policy</em>, which is a document that defines information security for an organization. To comply with this requirement, you must both put a policy in place and be able to prove that you’ve followed it with regular documentation. The day of the audit is not a good time to discover <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_82"/>that you lack the documentation to show your policy in use. Proper documentation could include emails, tickets from your ticketing system, and files from investigations.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Technical controls</em> manage risk using technical measures. You might mitigate risks by putting firewalls, intrusion detection systems, access control lists, and other technical measures in place to prevent attackers from getting into your systems.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">None of these controls is sufficient by itself, but each contributes to the layered defense necessary to provide good security and meet requirements. Often, the regulations themselves stipulate certain controls. For instance, the PCI DSS requirements include a variety of specific controls that organizations must implement to comply with the standard. Also, keep in mind that your controls are only as good as your implementation of them. If you implement a control improperly, then you might be worse off than if you hadn’t implemented it at all, because you’ve created a false sense of security.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4"><em>Key vs. Compensating Controls</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In addition to distinguishing types of controls, you can divide your controls into two levels of importance. <em>Key controls</em> are the primary controls used to manage risk in your environment and have the following characteristics:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">They provide a reasonable degree of assurance that the risk will be mitigated.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">If the control fails, it is unlikely that another control could take over for it.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">The failure of this control will affect an entire process.</p></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p class="indent">What you consider a key control will vary based on your environment and the present risks, and you should always test key controls as part of compliance or audit efforts. An example of a key control might be the use of antivirus software on all systems processing payment card information in an environment.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Compensating controls</em> are controls that replace impractical or unfeasible key controls. When you put a compensating control in place, you’ll likely have to explain to auditors how it will fulfill the intent and purpose of the control you’re replacing.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, although regulations may require you to run antivirus tools on all systems, certain systems might not have sufficient resources to run these utilities without adverse impacts. In this case, as a compensating control, you might use Linux operating systems, which are less susceptible to malware.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">Maintaining Compliance</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To maintain your compliance over time, you can cycle through the following set of activities, as shown in <a href="#ch6fig1">Figure 6-1</a>: monitoring, reviewing, documenting, and reporting.</p>&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_83"/>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch6fig1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/06fig01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-1: Maintaining compliance</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Following each step in this process helps you maintain the health of your controls.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Monitoring</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindentint0">You must monitor your controls (and the data produced by or related to them) on an ongoing basis to determine whether they effectively mitigate or reduce risk. In the information security world, no news often just means no good news. Since your environment and technology might change, it’s important to check that your controls—especially your key controls—continue to play their intended role. Without such monitoring, your controls quickly stop being useful, possibly without your knowledge.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Reviewing</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindentint0">Controls need to undergo a periodic review to determine whether they’re still effective and meet the objectives for managing risk in your particular environment. As old risks evolve and new risks arise, you’ll need to make sure your controls still cover these risks appropriately, determine whether you need any new controls, or decide whether you should retire old controls.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Documenting</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindentint0">You should document the results of your reviews and carefully track any changes to a control’s environment. Documentation helps you evaluate trends and maybe even predict future control changes, which can allow you to forecast the resources you’ll need later.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Reporting</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindentint0">After monitoring, reviewing, and documenting the state of your controls, you must report the results to your leadership. This not only keeps them aware of the state of your controls and enables them to make informed decisions for the organization but also provides you with a means of requesting the staff and resources you need for these efforts.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec4">Laws and Information Security</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When it comes to information security, enforcing laws and regulations is often trickier than in cases of physical incidents. Matters such as attributing attacks to a particular party or assessing the damage resulting from an attack—which can be simple when they concern, say, the vandalism of a building—are made considerably more difficult in the world of information security.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_84"/>Many laws and regulations developed in recent years seek to address these types of situations. Some of them leave gaps, while others overlap significantly. You’ll be measured against these laws when preparing for or being assessed for compliance. Let’s look at a few of them.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5"><em>Government-Related Regulatory Compliance</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In the United States, standards frequently form the basis for the laws and regulations that govern the behavior of the government and those who work closely with it. In the world of information security and compliance, these standards are often from the series of Special Publications (SPs) created by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). While NIST is not itself a regulatory agency, the standards it produces have compliance requirements, generally through other government compliance standards based on NIST’s SPs (yes, this is somewhat convoluted). Security professionals often play a major role in making sure that an organization complies with these government-related standards.</p>&#13;
<div class="sidebar">&#13;
<p class="sidebart"><strong>WHAT IS NIST?</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">What is now called NIST was originally created in the early 1900s to develop standards for weights and measures and serve as a national laboratory. Over time, its mission has evolved to include promoting technology and innovation in the United States. NIST’s Special Publications have a significant impact on information security.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Two of the most common government compliance standards are the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), which are both based on NIST SP 800-53, “Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations.”</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Federal Information Security Management Act</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 applies to all US federal government agencies, all state agencies that administer federal programs (such as Medicare), and all private companies that support, sell to, or receive grant money from the federal government.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">FISMA requires that an organization implement information security controls that use a <em>risk-based</em> approach—one that handles security by enumerating and compensating for specific risks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After an organization passes an audit, the federal agency they’re working with grants it an <em>authority to operate (ATO)</em>. Since the ATO is specific to each agency, a company working with ten different agencies must obtain ten different ATOs.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_85"/>Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, established in 2011, defines rules for government agencies contracting with cloud providers.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch06fn2" id="kch06fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> This applies to both cloud platform providers, such as AWS and Azure, and companies providing software as a service (SaaS) tools that are based in the cloud. I’ll discuss this distinction later in this chapter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Unlike FISMA, FedRAMP certification consists of a single ATO that allows an organization to do business with any number of federal agencies. Since the FedRAMP ATO is considerably broader, the requirements to obtain it are more stringent than FISMA’s. As of this writing, FedRAMP marketplace lists only 91 companies that possess an ATO.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch06fn3" id="kch06fn3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6"><em>Industry-Specific Regulatory Compliance</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Many regulatory compliance requirements pertain to a specific area of operation, such as the healthcare industry, public companies, and financial institutions. Let’s look at a few of these requirements.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 protects the rights and data of patients in the US healthcare system. Security professionals should pay specific attention to Title II of HIPAA, which lays out requirements for safeguarding protected health information (PHI) and electronic protected health information (e-PHI). (You can generally interpret these as consisting of any portion of a patient’s medical records or medical transactions.) While HIPAA primarily applies to organizations involved in healthcare or health insurance, it may also apply in other odd cases, such as employers that self-insure.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">HIPAA requires that you ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of any information that you handle or store; protect this information from threats and unauthorized disclosures; and ensure that your workforce is compliant with all of its rules. This can be a tall order, especially in institutions that handle large amounts of PHI.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Sarbanes–Oxley Act</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002 regulates financial data, operations, and assets for publicly held companies. The government-enacted SOX as a response to incidents of financial fraud among several large companies, most notably the Enron scandal of 2001, in which the public learned that the company had falsified years’ worth of financial reporting.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch06fn4" id="kch06fn4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Among other provisions, SOX places specific requirements on an organization’s electronic recordkeeping, including the integrity of records, retention periods for certain kinds of information, and methods of storing electronic communications. Security professionals often help design and implement systems impacted by SOX, so it pays for you to understand these regulations and your requirements under them.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_86"/>Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA) of 1999 aims to protect information (such as personally identifiable information (PII), which is any data that can identify a specific person) and financial data belonging to customers of financial institutions. Interestingly, GLBA defines <em>financial institution</em> broadly to include “banks, savings and loans, credit unions, insurance companies and securities firms … some retailers and automobile dealers that collect and share personal information about consumers to whom they extend or arrange credit,” as well as businesses that use financial data to collect debts from customers.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch06fn5" id="kch06fn5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To comply with GLBA, you must secure every pertinent record against unauthorized access, track people’s access to these records, and notify customers when you share their information. Organizations must also have a documented information security plan in place and specifically have an overarching information security program to handle security for the organization.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Children’s Internet Protection Act</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) of 2000 requires schools and libraries to prevent children from accessing obscene or harmful content over the Internet. CIPA requires these institutions to have policies and technical protection measures in place to block or filter such content. Additionally, these institutions must monitor the activities of minors and provide education regarding appropriate online behavior.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">CIPA encourages institutions to adopt these standards not by imposing penalties for noncompliance but by providing cheap internet access for eligible institutions that choose to comply with them.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1988 protects the privacy of minors younger than 13 by restricting organizations from collecting their PII, requiring the organizations to post a privacy policy online, make reasonable efforts to obtain parental consent, and notify parents that information is being collected. Many companies choose to charge a small fee for accounts belonging to a minor as a way of verifying parental consent, while others refuse service to minors entirely.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">COPPA is a bit of a hot potato in the information security world, as it requires organizations to judge the age of its users and provides for an even more restrictive class of PII for children if such data is to be collected, even by accident, both of which are difficult to execute with a high level of surety. In 2016, the mobile advertising company InMobi was fined $950,000 under COPPA for unknowingly tracking the location of minors younger than 13 with its advertising software.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch06fn6" id="kch06fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> As you can see, compliance here can be difficult, even when organizations are honestly attempting to do so.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_87"/>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 protects students’ records. FERPA applies to student at all levels, and when students turn 18, the rights to these records shift from the parents to the students.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">FERPA defines how institutions must handle student records to protect them and how people can view or share them. As schools now largely hold educational records in digital form, it’s not uncommon for a security professional to participate in incidents and design discussions, and to address general security issues when working at an institution that handles educational records.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7"><em>Laws Outside of the United States</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Foreign laws governing computing and data can differ greatly from US laws. If your organization operates internationally, you need to research the relevant laws in every country in which you plan to conduct business. You should also check for any treaties that regulate security practices and the exchange of information between those countries.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It pays to know ahead of time where you might encounter regulatory issues. For example, in one country, you might be able to gather log data containing a list of machines and associated usernames, cross-referenced with the owner’s employee number and email address. But in another country, collecting this data might be more difficult, or perhaps even illegal.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">One example of an international regulation relevant to information security is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which the European Union enacted in 2018. GDPR covers data protection and privacy for all individuals in the European Union. The regulation applies to anyone collecting data about EU citizens, regardless of the country in which you’re working.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">GDPR requires that organizations get consent before collecting people’s data, report data breaches, give individuals the right to access and remove collected data, and set specific guidelines for privacy and privacy programs. Given the broad applicability of GDPR, security and privacy programs all over the world had to adapt when this law came into effect, prompting a great many customer communications, new privacy-oriented banners on websites, and updates to many organizations’ policies.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch06fn7" id="kch06fn7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec5">Adopting Frameworks for Compliance</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In addition to the frameworks provided by specific regulations, it’s helpful to choose a framework for your overall compliance efforts. For example, if your organization is bound to comply with separate, unrelated regulations—HIPAA and PCI DSS, for example—you might want to choose a more overarching framework to guide the entire compliance effort and security program and then adjust it as needed for specific areas of compliance.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_88"/>In this section, you’ll learn about some frameworks you can use. Choosing a well-known framework can also ease the path of an audit, as you’re able to give the auditor an idea of what to expect of your program and the specific controls that you’ve implemented.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8"><em>International Organization for Standardization</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a body first created in 1926 to set standards between nations. It has created more than 21,000 standards “covering almost every industry, from technology, to food safety, to agriculture and healthcare.”<a href="notes.xhtml#ch06fn8" id="kch06fn8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The ISO 27000 series that covers information security includes standards such as the following:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">ISO/IEC 27000, “Information security management systems – Overview and vocabulary”</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">ISO/IEC 27001, “Information technology – Security Techniques – Information security management systems – Requirements”</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">ISO/IEC 27002, “Code of practice for information security controls”</p></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="indent">This series of ISO standards, also referred to in the industry as ISO 27k, discusses information security management systems and is intended to help manage the security of the assets within your organization. These documents lay out best practices for managing risk, controls, privacy, technical issues, and a wide array of other specifics.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9"><em>National Institute of Standards and Technology</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication provides guidelines for many topics in computing and technology, including risk management. Two of the commonly referenced publications in this area are SP 800-37, “Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems,” and SP 800-53, “Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">SP 800-37 lays out the risk management framework in the following six steps, which form the basis of many security programs:</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentintt"><strong>Categorize</strong> Categorize the system based on the information it handles and the impact of exposing or losing such data.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentint"><strong>Select</strong> Select controls based on the system’s categorization and any extenuating circumstances.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentint"><strong>Implement</strong> Implement the controls and document the implementation.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentint"><strong>Assess</strong> Assess the controls to ensure that they’re properly implemented and performing as expected.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentint"><strong>Authorize</strong> Authorize or ban the use of the system based on the risk it faces and the controls implemented to mitigate that risk.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentintb1"><strong>Monitor</strong> Monitor the controls to ensure that they continue to appropriately mitigate risk.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_89"/>If you intend to select controls based on SP 800-37, you can find specific guidelines for that purpose in SP 800-53.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><em>Custom Frameworks</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You could always develop your own framework or modify an existing one, but you should think carefully before doing so. As you’ve just seen, plenty of frameworks for risk management already exist, all of which have undergone considerable review and testing. You probably shouldn’t try to reinvent the wheel here.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec6">Compliance amid Technological Changes</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Keeping up with technological change can provide challenges for both the bodies that enforce compliance and those who are attempting to achieve it. An excellent example of this is cloud computing, discussed in this section.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Before hosting data and applications in the cloud became a common technology trend, organizations generally owned their own servers and infrastructure and hosted them either internally or in a co-located data center. This presented a relatively black-and-white set of areas for who owned and was responsible for the security of these devices.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now that entire companies exist almost entirely in the cloud, compliance efforts have shifted in an attempt to specifically cope with these situations; new policies might govern how to track and evaluate third-party security and compliance efforts, new regulations determine how to manage cloud data, and auditors ask entirely new questions, requiring evidence specific to these types of environments.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">While most of the technology change is relatively gradual, allowing the security and compliance industries to slowly shift to keep pace with it, this is not always the case. Two relatively new and potentially disruptive technologies have the potential to cause further shift in compliance requirements for some industries: blockchain and cryptocurrencies.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11"><em>Compliance in the Cloud</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">For organizations operating partially or entirely in the cloud, compliance can present an additional set of challenges. That’s because cloud offerings come in different models, each of which gives you a differing level of control over the environment. These models are <em>infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</em>, <em>platform as a service (PaaS)</em>, and <em>software as a service (SaaS)</em>, as shown in <a href="#ch6fig2">Figure 6-2</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch6fig2"><img alt="Image" src="../images/06fig02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-2: Cloud models</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_90"/>At a high level, IaaS provides you with access to virtual servers and storage. Examples include Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. PaaS provides you with prebuilt servers, such as database or web servers, like Azure, and SaaS provides you with access to a specific application or application suite, as in the case of Google Apps.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">PaaS gives you some level of control, and SaaS gives you little or none. Conversely, IaaS requires you to adopt a greater level of responsibility, PaaS requires you to adopt some level of responsibility, and SaaS requires you to adopt very little of it. To quote from <em>Spider-Man</em>, “With great power comes great responsibility.” (The attribution of this quote is a bit tricky, but I can credit Stan Lee in “Amazing Fantasy #15” with relative safety.)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The choice of which of these types of services to use is a matter of balancing your need for flexibility and configurability with how easy the service should be to use. If you want to send a simple email and be done, it would be logical for you to use a tool like Gmail (SaaS) to do so. It would not make very much sense, in this case, for you to build and configure a virtual server, install and configure mail server software on it (IaaS), and then send your email.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Who Owns the Risk?</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In each cloud model, the cloud provider must take responsibility for the portions of the environment that the users can’t control. That means that, in some cases, you’ll be responsible for securing your data directly; in other cases, you’ll be responsible for ensuring that the services you’re using secure it appropriately.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In IaaS environments, the cloud provider owns the risks related to the networks and servers on which the virtual infrastructure exists. In other words, it’s responsible for securing and maintaining the hosts (the servers that run the virtual machines), the storage arrays on which the customer’s storage volumes reside, and the networks used by the hosts, among other components. Because IaaS gives you a large amount of control over the environment and how it is configured, it requires you to adopt a greater level of responsibility.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In PaaS environments, the cloud customers access the servers directly, but they can’t access the infrastructure that runs those servers. In this case, the cloud provider assumes responsibility for the security of that infrastructure, including tasks such as patching the operating system, configuring the servers, backing up the servers, and maintaining storage volumes.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In SaaS environments, customers probably won’t be able to make changes to the infrastructure or servers at all, which means the cloud provider is responsible for them entirely. Customers might still be responsible for the data they input into the environment, but not for the security of the environment itself.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Audit and Assessment Rights</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Your contract with the cloud provider generally stipulates your right to audit and assess the security of the cloud environment. In many cases, the service <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_91"/>allows customers to audit and assess the environment within certain specific bounds. For instance, it might stipulate how and when you can ask the provider for an audit by your internal audit team or a third-party audit company. These limits are reasonable, since responding to each audit request takes a lot of work. The provider might also respond to audit requests by providing the result of an annual external audit conducted expressly for the purposes of responding to requests such as these.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you hope to directly assess the security of a cloud provider, perhaps with a penetration test (which I’ll discuss in depth in <a href="ch14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a>), you might meet resistance. Many providers deny such requests outright or allow penetration tests only under very specific and tightly restricted conditions. This is also understandable for many of the same reasons that they might limit audits. Additionally, active security testing often impacts the infrastructure, platform, or application being tested, and the provider might experience service issues as a result.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Technology Challenges</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Cloud services pose technological challenges related to compliance because they’re shared resources. If you’re using cloud resources on the same host server as another company, that company’s lack of security could easily impact the security of your systems, as well.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Risks increase in cloud services that the provider manages more closely, such as SaaS, because you share a larger portion of the environment with other customers. You may have data intermingled with that of other customers in the same database, with only the application logic keeping your data apart from theirs.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In an IaaS service, on the other hand, although you’re sharing some of the same server resources to host virtual machines and some of the same storage space, a sharp divide exists between your resources and the resources of others.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12"><em>Compliance with Blockchain</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Blockchain is a distributed and uneditable digital ledger. Transactions are recorded to the ledger as a block, and each block is attached to the previous block in the chain by a one-way mathematical handshake (similar to a hash, as discussed in <a href="ch05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>). Each participant has a copy of the blockchain, and the consensus of 51 percent of participants defines the accepted chain (generally the longest chain).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In security terms, blockchain promises a strong form of integrity. When you record something to blockchain, you can, with a high degree of certainty, say that it wasn’t altered when you look at it later. For example, Walmart uses this technology to track the path of its food products from the supplier with which they originate to the stores that will sell them to customers.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch06fn9" id="kch06fn9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When it comes to compliance, it’s important to create controls that demonstrate an understanding of how blockchain works. For example, people often cite the use of blockchain as an indelible record that you can write to something and never be concerned with that data being altered. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_92"/>Unfortunately, this is true only under certain conditions. You can force consensus on blockchain by controlling 51 percent of the participants, at which point you can write whatever you like to it. Some companies have even gone as far as to promote “private” blockchains, which really amounts to just using encryption to ensure the integrity of the data. Someone trying to regulate blockchain should understand what drawbacks there may be in using it; if you rush from one hot new technology to the next, you may be putting in place controls that are, in actuality, only security theater.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13"><em>Compliance with Cryptocurrencies</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A <em>cryptocurrency</em> is a form of digital currency often based on the use of blockchain. Cryptocurrencies are unquestionably a disruptive technology. The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, appeared in 2009 and has enjoyed a wild variance in value between now and then.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Bitcoin generates currency through the same means it uses to keep the underlying blockchain functioning. To attach each block in the Bitcoin to the chain, as discussed, it needs to be verified with a mathematical handshake. This function requires some level of computing power from all of those participating in the blockchain, and as an incentive, those who participate are rewarded with a Bitcoin. This process of generating new Bitcoins is known as <em>Bitcoin mining</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In February 2019, Gerald Cotton, the founder of Quadriga (which at the time was the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Canada), reportedly perished suddenly. Cotton, a security-minded fellow, maintained the entire exchange from offline accounts stored on his highly encrypted laptop. Upon his death, the entirety of the approximately $190 million in cryptocurrency held by the exchange across 115,000 clients vanished into thin air as his laptop became inaccessible. As of this writing, the exact circumstances surrounding this incident are still under investigation, although there are rumors that the incident involved some sort of chicanery.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As an organization, you are likely bound by a number of laws and regulations that govern financial transactions, as well as those that define the rules for investors and reporting to them. The use of cryptocurrency in business at all is still a gray area, although many businesses do so. It is all but certain, however, that you would, as an organization, be unable to shrug off a multimillion-dollar loss due to a cryptocurrency technology failure without serious repercussions from a legal and regulatory perspective.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec7">Summary</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, I discussed the laws and regulations relevant to information security and what it means to comply with them. A great number of these are pertinent to computing, and they can vary heavily from one country to the next. Businesses might face both regulatory compliance and industry compliance, which they typically maintain by implementing controls.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_93"/>I also talked about compliance in newer technologies, such as cloud computing and blockchain, which present additional challenges for those attempting to regulate them.</p>&#13;

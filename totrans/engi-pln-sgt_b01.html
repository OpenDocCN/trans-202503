<p class="BodyFirst">I owe a great deal of thanks to those who made this book possible:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li>My wife, Crystal, who is endlessly supportive, occasionally funny, and the love of my life.</li>
<li>My son, Cliff, who unwittingly pushed me to choose a career <em>about</em> engineering over one in it.</li>
<li>My brother, Graham, who showed me how to take risks, is the sounding board for every idea I have, and is my most helpful critic.</li>
<li>My cousin, Samuel, who was the first participant of “What’s That Infrastructure?”—a road trip game I invented so that I could talk about civil engineering more.</li>
<li>My best friend and collaborator, Wesley Crump, who first suggested that I write a book and then became an invaluable team member when I decided to actually do it.</li>
<li>My parents, Joe and Carol, whose support, encouragement, and exemplification of all of life’s important skills eventually led me to where they knew I was headed all along.</li>
<li>My editor, Jill Franklin, and all the staff at No Starch Press who immediately understood my vision, patiently coached me through the book writing process, and worked terribly hard to create something special.</li>
<li>My illustration team at MUTI, led by Brad Hodgskiss, who converted my conglomerations of stock images and chicken scratches into imaginative works of art.</li>
<li>The technical reviewers listed at the beginning of the book who provided their wisdom and experience to improve each chapter and catch my errors.</li>
<li>All my professors at Texas State University and Texas A&amp;M University and all my former colleagues at Freese and Nichols who shared with me their enthusiasm and expertise in engineering, construction, environmental science, and much more.</li>
<li>Finally, all the fans of <em>Practical Engineering</em> on YouTube and elsewhere for your comments, email, and viewership. I could never have written this book without the encouragement and feedback I’ve received from you over the past six years.</li>

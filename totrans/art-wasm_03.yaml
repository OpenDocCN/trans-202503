    import functions from JavaScript or a different WebAssembly module and how to
    export WebAssembly functions to the embedding environment and call those functions
    from JavaScript. Youâ€™ll learn about tables in WebAssembly and how to call functions
    defined in tables. We also examine the performance implications of calling functions
    that we define inside and outside of the WebAssembly module.'

- en: A WebAssembly module interacts with the embedding environment using imported
    and exported functions. We must import functions from the embedding environment
    for WebAssembly to use and export functions for a web page to call. We can also
    write functions from within the WebAssembly module to export to the embedding
    environment using an `export statement. Otherwise, functions are by default contained
    for use only within the module.`

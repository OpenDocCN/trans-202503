<p>A US listening post recorded the message and forwarded it to MI-8, the US wartime codebreaking unit, for analysis. Herbert Yardley, MI-8’s famous lead, soon guessed that this cryptogram had been created with a so-called dictionary code.</p>
<p>We will use the analysis of this message as an example in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502727c14-0001"><a class="XrefDestination" id="Howdictionarycodesandbookcipherswork"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c14-003"/>How dictionary codes and book ciphers work</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">A <em>dictionary code</em>, which typically uses a commercially available dictionary, records the page and position of a word in the book as its ciphertext representation. This chapter’s first example used the English-French half of <em>Clifton’s Nouveau Dictionnaire Français</em>, according to Yardley’s report. The five-digit group <code>43827</code>, for instance, stood for the twenty-seventh word listed on page 438 of this dictionary. (As we discussed in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 7"><a href="c07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a></span>, a dictionary code is not a cipher because it encrypts words, not letters.)</p>
<p>The following list explains the five-letter groups in the cryptogram’s first line:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li><code>49138</code> (p. 491, 38th word): <code class="bold">TELEGRAM</code></li>
<li><code>27141</code> (p. 271, 41st word): <code class="bold">JANUARY</code></li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_287" title="287"/><code>51336</code> (p. 513, 36th word): <code class="bold">TWO</code></li>
<li><code>02062</code> (p. 20, 62nd word): <code class="bold">AND</code></li>
<li><code>49140</code> (p. 491, 40th word): <code class="bold">TELEGRAPHIC</code></li>
<li><code>41345</code> (p. 413, 45th word): <code class="bold">REPORT</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, the plaintext starts as follows: <code class="bold">TELEGRAM</code><code class="bold"> [FROM] JANUARY TWO AND TELEGRAPHIC REPORT [FROM] S. ANTHONY DELMAR VIA SPAIN RECEIVED.</code></p>
<p>A similar encryption scheme can be defined with any other book, such as a novel. We call these <em>book ciphers</em>. As it is usually quite difficult to find a particular word in a novel (unless it is a common expression like <code class="bold">THE</code>, <code class="bold">AND</code>, or <code class="bold">IF</code>), a book cipher usually references single letters instead of whole words, which is why it is a cipher, not a code.</p>
<p>A prominent user of a book cipher was Nicholas Trist (1800–1874), a US diplomat sent to Mexico by President James K. Polk in 1848, toward the end of the Mexican-American War. Trist negotiated a treaty with the Mexican government, which resulted in the annexation of a great deal of territory that became all or part of ten modern states.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c14-endnote-2" id="c14-noteref-2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>In order to protect letters sent to and from Washington, Trist needed an encryption system. He devised two of them, both book ciphers. See the <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_“Success stories”">“Success stories”</span> section of this chapter for the sleuthing that was needed to find the correct book.</p>
<p>The following text is (partially) encrypted in his first cipher:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Sir,</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>In my last I said, “I consider the probabilities of an early peace very strong.” The enclosed will be found to corroborate this belief. 1,2,3,10—15,13,4,1—39,26,11,31—44,75,121,31—/47,1,6,16/7,3,15,20,24,27,28,29/,,8,1,9/,,9,1/,,2,5/,,1,1/,,1,16,29/69,2,1/,, 6,7/,,2,3,2/,,6,4,6,10,8/ under date July 29: 5,33,25,4—30,105,44,45,58—from a foreign merchant to this correspondent here . . .</code></p>
<p>The book Trist used was an 1827 textbook for learning Spanish: <em>True Principles of the Spanish Language</em> by José Borras. Trist probably thought that a book of this kind in the possession of an American traveler in Mexico would not raise suspicion.</p>
<p>Each number group in Trist’s first cipher, separated by commas, represents one or more letters taken from <em>True Principles of the Spanish Language</em> in the following way: page, line, letter, letter . . . This means that the group <code>1,2,3,10</code> encodes two letters, while the group <code>7,3,15,20,24,27,28,29</code> encodes six.</p>
<p>Likewise, <code>47,1,6,16</code> encodes two letters. If we know that the first line on page 47 is . . .</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>TABLE TWENTY-FIFTH – The fly and the bull</code></p>
<p class="BodyContinued">. . . then we can conclude that the numbers <code>47,1,6,16</code> stand for the letters <code class="bold">T</code> and <code class="bold">H</code> (the spaces and the dash are not counted). If a number group starts with two missing numbers (as in <code>,,2,3,2</code>), then the page and line number from the previous group are used.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_288" title="288"/>Many other book ciphers have existed in the course of history. We even mentioned one in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 6"><a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a></span>: the system used to encrypt the second Beale cryptogram, where the “book” was the Declaration of Independence. Instead of identifying each letter with three numbers (page, line, and position), Beale’s cipher recorded only the position of words. This means that the first word in the Declaration of Independence is number <code>1</code>, the second word is number <code>2</code>, and so on. To encode the plaintext, only the first letter of the word is used.</p>
<p>Nicholas Trist devised a second cipher based on the same concept as Beale’s and using the same book as his other cipher. In a letter, he mentioned “<code class="bold">a short note</code><code class="bold"> [sent] to</code> <code>121,13,1,2,17,5,9,20</code>.” We can decrypt these eight letters, encrypted in his second cipher, by looking at the first page of the book (<a href="#figure14-1" id="figureanchor14-1">Figure 14-1</a>). If you attempt this, you’ll see that the expression <code>121,13,1,2,17,5,9,20</code> decrypts to <code class="bold">MR THNTON</code>. This probably refers to a Mr. Thornton. (Trist seems to have omitted two letters of the name.)</p>

<p>Dictionary codes and book ciphers were quite popular in the early years of the United States. During the American Revolution, Benedict Arnold, a traitor, encrypted a number of letters in a book cipher using Sir William Blackstone’s <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England</em>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c14-endnote-3" id="c14-noteref-3">3</a></sup> As the book cipher proved cumbersome, he soon switched to a dictionary code based on <em>Nathan</em> <em>Bailey’s Dictionary</em>.</p>
<p>Alexander Hamilton, one of the Founders of the United States and the hero of the eponymous Broadway musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda, was given a description of a dictionary code by his father-in-law, Philip Schuyler, whose system was based on the 1777 edition of <em>Entick’s Spelling Dictionary</em>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c14-endnote-4" id="c14-noteref-4">4</a></sup> History has not recorded whether Hamilton ever used this code, but we do <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_289" title="289"/>know that both the English and the US militaries employed this dictionary for the purposes of encryption. British generals Charles Cornwallis and Henry Clinton used it during the Revolutionary War, and a record suggests that US Vice President Aaron Burr, who killed Hamilton for unrelated reasons in a famous duel in 1804, used the 1805 version of that same dictionary in his own correspondence.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c14-endnote-5" id="c14-noteref-5">5</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="h1-502727c14-0002"><a class="XrefDestination" id="Howtodetectadictionarycodeorbookcipher"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c14-004"/>How to detect a dictionary code or book cipher</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Detecting a dictionary code can be quite simple. For instance, look at the World War II–era message shown in <a href="#figure14-2" id="figureanchor14-2">Figure 14-2</a>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c14-endnote-6" id="c14-noteref-6">6</a></sup> This is an English translation of a German telegram.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c14-endnote-7" id="c14-noteref-7">7</a></sup></p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure14-2">Figure 14-2</a>: This (translated) telegram from World War II includes two dictionary code expressions.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The numbers <code>244</code>, <code>1345</code>, and <code>4992</code> are probably codegroups from an unidentified codebook and are not relevant here.</p>
<p>Of note, this cryptogram contains the expressions <code>264/6</code> and <code>112/3</code>. The most popular encryption methods that produce expressions using this slash format are dictionary codes and book ciphers. If this suspicion is correct, <code>264</code> in <code>264/6</code> probably stands for the page, while <code>6</code> represents the position of a word or letter. In fact, the two expressions were taken from the <em>Langenscheidt’s Lilliput Dictionary English–German</em>; <code>264/6</code> stands for <code class="bold">PIER</code> and <code>112/3</code> for <code class="bold">DECEMBER</code>.</p>
<p>If there is no visible separation between the page number and the word position, detecting a dictionary code or a book cipher is a little more difficult. Such a system can, for instance, easily be confused with a code or nomenclator (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 7"><a href="c07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a></span>). In those cases, here is some helpful information: typically, there are fewer than one hundred words on a dictionary page and usually even fewer than fifty. So, if a cryptogram contains digit groups in the form <code>XXXYY</code>, one should check whether <code>YY</code> is smaller than fifty in every instance.</p>
<p>Of course, the code may be a reversed system such as <code>YY-XXX</code> or some other scrambled method. Also, if the number is greater than fifty, a book cipher, where larger numbers of words fit on one page, might have been used. For example, the Beale system counted the hundreds of words in the Declaration of Independence from beginning to end.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Breaking a dictionary code or book cipher can be very difficult. If the code is used properly, and if the cryptanalyst does not know the book, it may even be impossible. However, the book can sometimes be found. Also, as is always the case in cryptography, the codebreaker can profit from mistakes the encipherer has made.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502727c14-0001"><a class="XrefDestination" id="Identifyingthebookordictionary"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c14-006"/>Identifying the book or dictionary</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">The most obvious way to break a dictionary code or a book cipher is to find the book it is based on. We have already seen an example (probably fictional) in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 6"><a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a></span>: according to the Beale pamphlet, a man deciphered the second Beale cryptogram after identifying that it had used the Declaration of Independence for encryption.</p>
<p>Another (definitely fictitious) case occurs in the 1915 Sherlock Holmes novel <em>The Valley of Fear</em> by Arthur Conan Doyle. In this novel, Holmes receives an encrypted message from a certain Fred Porlock and suspects that he is dealing with a book-cipher cryptogram. He concludes that the book used is widely available, large (with at least 534 pages), and printed in two columns per page. Most almanacs meet these conditions exactly.</p>
<p>Holmes first tries the latest edition of <em>Whitaker’s Almanack</em>, which he had received only a few days earlier, to no avail. He then tries the previous edition of the same book—and it works. With this almanac, Holmes is able to decipher the message and uncover a warning that “some devilry” is intended. Of course, in the end, he solves the case.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502727c14-0002"><a class="XrefDestination" id="Reconstructingthedictionary"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c14-007"/>Reconstructing the dictionary</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">In his 1922 book <em>Cryptography</em>, Swiss cryptologist André Langie reports on the following cryptogram he was asked to solve:<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c14-endnote-8" id="c14-noteref-8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>5761 3922 7642 0001 9219 6448 6016 4570 4368 7159</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>8686 8576 1378 2799 6018 4212 3940 0644 7262 8686</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>7670 4049 3261 4176 6638 4833 4827 0001 3696 6062</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>8686 2137 4049 2485 7948 0300 9712 0300 4212 9576</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>2475 8576 8337 0702 9185</code></p>
<p>As can be seen, the message consists of forty-five four-digit numbers. At first glance, it doesn’t look like a dictionary code, as separating the four-digit numbers into “page” numbers and “word” numbers doesn’t make sense unless the dictionary used has about a hundred pages with about a hundred entries per page, which is not very likely.</p>
<p>But what if the sender of the message numbered the entries of a dictionary from beginning to end, without including the page number? This option becomes much more likely when we consider that the number <code>0001</code> appears twice in this text. The first entry in an English dictionary is usually the article <em>A</em>. As <em>A</em> is a common word, it is plausible that it appears twice in a text of this length.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_291" title="291"/>Let’s assume that we may be dealing with a dictionary cipher of this kind. Here is a sorted list of the four-digit numbers appearing in the text:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>0001, 0001, 0300, 0300, 0644, 0702, 1378, 2137, 2475, 2485, 2799, 3261, 3696, 3922, 3940, 4049, 4049, 4176, 4212, 4212, 4368, 4570, 4827, 4833, 5761, 6016, 6018, 6062, 6448, 6638, 7159, 7262, 7642, 7670, 7948, 8337, 8576, 8576, 8686, 8686, 8686, 9185, 9219, 9576, 9712</code></p>
<p>Along with <code>0001</code>, we see that other groupings are repeated as well: <code>0300</code>, <code>4049</code>, <code>4212</code>, <code>8576</code>, and <code>8686</code>.</p>
<p>The following table might be helpful. It shows how words with starting letters <em>A</em> through <em>Z</em> are distributed in a dictionary containing the 10,000 most frequent English words.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c14-endnote-9" id="c14-noteref-9">9</a></sup> Along with the words’ starting positions, this table shows how, for some letters, there are significantly fewer pages of entries than for others.</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>A 0001 – 0643</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>B 0644 – 1178</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>C 1179 – 2160</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>D 2161 – 2755</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>E 2756 – 3177</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>F 3178 – 3599</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>G 3600 – 3926</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>H 3927 – 4295</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>I 4296 – 4717</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>J 4718 – 4800</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>K 4801 – 4877</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>L 4878 – 5216</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>M 5217 – 5710</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>N 5711 – 5871</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>O 5872 – 6109</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>P 6110 – 6960</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Q 6961 – 7019</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>R 7020 – 7513</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>S 7514 – 8715</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>T 8716 – 9298</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>U 9299 – 9453</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>V 9454 – 9637</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>W 9638 – 9929</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>X 9930 – 9941</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Y 9442 – 9971</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Z 9972 – 10000</code></p>
<p>Now look at group <code>0300</code>, which appears twice in the cryptogram. If we are correct about the encryption system used, it is very likely that this word starts with an <code class="bold">A</code> and that the second letter is located somewhere in the middle of the alphabet. <code class="bold">AND</code> is a good candidate.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_292" title="292"/>The number <code>8686</code> appears three times in the cryptogram, which makes it the most frequent digit group in this ciphertext. Close to it is <code>8576</code>, which appears twice. According to the table we created, the words at these locations should start with <code class="bold">S</code>. But are there two common English words starting with <code class="bold">S</code> so close to each other in the alphabet? <code class="bold">STILL</code> and <code class="bold">SUCH</code> might be candidates, but further inspection shows that these are not good matches.</p>
<p>Instead, let’s assume that the letter distribution in the dictionary used by the message’s author differs a little from the one in our table. Perhaps looking at words starting with <code class="bold">T</code> will work. In fact, there are two words that seem to fit: <code class="bold">THE</code> and <code class="bold">TO</code>. This guess is confirmed by the fact that the sequence <code>8686 8576</code> appears in the ciphertext, and <code class="bold">TO THE</code> is a common word pair.</p>
<p>Based on our guesses, we can sketch the following:</p>

<p>Admittedly, it gets difficult from here. We need to guess more words, but we only know the (probable) initial letter of each one.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_293" title="293"/>To make things a little easier, let’s assume that we know a small part of the plaintext (i.e., a crib). Say that we have been told that this message is military in nature and that it contains information about an enemy offensive. In fact, the numbers <code>2799</code> and <code>6018</code> in the second line might stand for <code class="bold">ENEMY OFFENSIVE</code>. If this is the case, <code>1378</code>, which stands between <code class="bold">TO THE</code> and <code class="bold">ENEMY OFFENSIVE</code>, might be <code class="bold">COMING</code>. The number <code>6016</code> in the first line is pretty close to <code>6018</code> (<code class="bold">OFFENSIVE</code>). The most likely decryption is <code class="bold">OF</code>.</p>
<p>The second-highest number, <code>9576</code>, is probably a <code class="bold">W</code> word, perhaps <code class="bold">WERE</code> or <code class="bold">WILL</code>. It is followed by <code>2475</code>, a D word, which is itself followed by <code class="bold">THE</code>. What can it be? Alphabetically, it occurs somewhere between <code class="bold">COMING</code> (<code>1378</code>) and <code class="bold">ENEMY</code> (<code>2799</code>). The interval between these two is <code>1421</code>, and the difference between <code>1378</code> and <code>2475</code> is <code>1097</code>, roughly three-fourths of the interval. This leads us to the <em>Dis</em> and <em>Dos</em>. There is another number in the text occupying about the same dictionary position: <code>2485</code>. Either <code>2475</code> or <code>2485</code> might be <code class="bold">DO</code>. Suppose we assign <code class="bold">DO</code> to <code>2485</code> and look for a word closely preceding it that suits our context. A dictionary file shows us <code class="bold">DIVULGE</code> and <code class="bold">DIVIDE</code>. The numbers <code>0300</code> through <code>8576</code> may therefore stand for <code class="bold">AND YOU AND I WILL DIVIDE THE</code>.</p>
<p>To solve the rest of the cryptogram, we can use similar guesses. We will certainly make a false step occasionally, but every word established strengthens our foothold. The more words we guess, the easier it will be to find further ones. Here’s the plaintext we finally receive. (The first word is not known but is probably a name starting with <code class="bold">M</code>.)</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>???? HAS SECURED A VALUABLE PIECE OF INFORMATION IN REGARD TO THE COMING ENEMY OFFENSIVE. I HAVE BEEN REQUESTED TO SEND HIM FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS. IT IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO DENOUNCE HIM. DO SO, AND YOU AND I WILL DIVIDE THE SUM BETWEEN US.</code></p>
<p>Breaking a dictionary code in this way is certainly not easy. However, as will be shown in the <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_“Success stories”">“Success stories”</span> section of this chapter, it is possible.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Depending on its construction, a book cipher can also be regarded as a simple substitution cipher, homophonic cipher, or nomenclator. This means that we can solve certain book cipher cryptograms using the techniques for breaking encryptions of each of those types. As an example, look at the handwritten dedication we found in a used copy of the esteemed Martin Gardner’s 1972 book <em>Codes, Ciphers and Secret Writing</em>, which is a very basic introduction to cryptology (see <a href="#figure14-3" id="figureanchor14-3">Figure 14-3</a>).<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c14-endnote-10" id="c14-noteref-10">10</a></sup></p>

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_294" title="294"/>Here’s a transcript:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>1-11,1-9,1-4,1-4,1-12 78-3,3-3,1-8,1-5,1-11,5-1,1-9,1-12</code></p>
<p>There are multiple ways to solve this cryptogram, but if we look at it as nothing more than a simple substitution cipher, we could use the following strategy. First, let’s replace each hyphenated two-number group with a letter, going from left to right and introducing a new letter each time we encounter a new number pair. That would transcribe this cryptogram as follows:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>ABCCD EFGHAIBD</code></p>
<p>Among the many words that match the pattern <code>ABCCD</code> is <code class="bold">HAPPY</code>. (A quick way to find such word-pattern matches is with a program such as CrypTool 2.) If we then replace the letters accordingly, it gives us the following second word: <code class="bold">****H*AY</code>. It’s not very hard from there to guess that the plaintext is <code class="bold">HAPPY BIRTHDAY</code>.</p>
<p>As another way of solving it (perhaps the method originally intended), if we look at the first paragraph of Gardner’s <em>Codes, Ciphers and Secret Writing</em> . . .</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Cryptography, the writing and deciphering of messages . . .</code></p>
<p class="BodyContinued">. . . we see that we are dealing with a book cipher. Here, <code>1-11</code> stands for the eleventh letter of the first word, <code class="bold">H</code>; <code>1-9</code> for the ninth letter of the first word, <code class="bold">A</code>; and so on.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Between 1862 and 1866, a series of twenty-three advertisements was published in the London paper <em>The Times</em>.

<p>Our source for the <code>FIDES</code> cryptograms is, of course, the wonderful 2005 book <em>The Agony Column Codes &amp; Ciphers</em> by Jean Palmer (a pen name of Tony Gaffney), which we have referenced many times in previous chapters.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c14-endnote-12" id="c14-noteref-12">12</a></sup> Gaffney solved most of the encrypted ads listed in his book himself; however, he hadn’t yet found a solution to the <code>FIDES</code> cryptograms when his book was published in 2005.</p>
<p>A few years later, Gaffney once again tried to solve the <code>FIDES</code> cryptograms, this time assuming that he was dealing with a dictionary code, in which case, an expression like <code>146.7</code> stood for the seventh word on page 146. Based on frequency analysis and cribs provided by the cleartext part of the advertisements, Gaffney was able to make some guesses. However, in order to completely solve the mystery, he needed to find the dictionary used. After many hours of searching the British Library, he had looked through no fewer than forty-eight English dictionaries from the nineteenth century. The forty-ninth proved to be the one that fit: <em>Johnson’s Pocket Dictionary of the English Language</em>, published in 1862.</p>
<p>From there, it became clear exactly how the code worked. The first number of each pair turned out to be the page number plus one. The second number was the word number counted from the bottom of the page, starting from the right-hand column and then continuing down the left-hand one. In addition, <code>1</code> represented <code class="bold">I</code> and <code>2</code> represented <code class="bold">YOU</code>; <code>20</code> stood for a comma or a period.</p>
<p>The advertisement dated “1864-06-22” decrypts to <code class="bold">DARLING PRECIOUS WEARY OAF THOU BETTER THAN LIFE</code>. Some of these words might have made sense only to the people involved!

<p class="BodyFirst">Earlier in this chapter, we mentioned that US diplomat Nicholas Trist used two book ciphers to communicate with the US government during his stay in Mexico.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c14-endnote-14" id="c14-noteref-14">14</a></sup> Crypto-historian Ralph E. Weber described these ciphers in his 1979 book <em>United States Diplomatic Codes and Ciphers</em>, but he couldn’t decipher all of Trist’s messages, as he didn’t know the book Trist had used.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c14-endnote-15" id="c14-noteref-15">15</a></sup> All he knew was that both of Trist’s ciphers were based on the same book.</p>
<p>A few years later, when cryptologist Stephen M. Matyas read Weber’s book, he decided to try to solve the mystery.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c14-endnote-16" id="c14-noteref-16">16</a></sup> Matyas observed that Trist mentioned a few facts about his key book in a letter, describing it as a small volume containing the dedication “To the British Nation.” He also mentioned that it was <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_296" title="296"/>divided into at least two parts and was written by a person in Washington who had been sent to Spain as consul. In addition, Weber found out that the book’s text began with the words, “The study of foreign languages . . .”</p>
<p>To identify the author of Trist’s key book, Matyas compiled a list of all people who had been sent from Washington to Spain or a Spanish colony as a consul. The final list contained approximately fifty people, many of whom, surprisingly, had published books. After some research, Matyas identified a man named José Borras as the most promising candidate. Borras, a US consul in Barcelona, had published a book titled <em>True Principles of the Spanish Language</em> in 1827. This book fit with the description, especially because it dealt with a foreign language.</p>
<p>Matyas managed to locate a copy of the book in the Newberry Library in Chicago, and it did indeed contain the dedication and starting words he was looking for. With a bit more work, the mystery was solved, and Nicholas Trist’s correspondence could be deciphered. For examples, see the beginning of this chapter.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502727c14-0006"><a class="XrefDestination" id="HowWilliamFriedmanbrokeaHinduconspiracyencryption"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c14-012"/>How William Friedman broke a Hindu conspiracy encryption</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">During World War I, Hindu groups in India began a rebellion against their British colonizers, and certain members of these groups operated from the United States to deliver arms and logistical support. The US authorities treated the Hindu conspirators as criminals violating weapons laws and planning a revolution against the British, who were considered friendly.</p>
<p>In 1917, a Scotland Yard representative in the United States forwarded to William Friedman a stack of encrypted correspondence that had been intercepted from Hindu conspirators. At the time, Friedman’s codebreaking career had just begun.</p>
<p>Along with the letters, the representative provided Friedman with a list of suspects, the names of whom he could use as cribs. Unfortunately, neither the correspondence nor the suspects’ names have ever been published. The only available information about this story (as far as we know) comes from a 1920 report by Friedman himself<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c14-endnote-17" id="c14-noteref-17">17</a></sup> and a short treatise contained in the 1996 edition of David Kahn’s book <em>The Codebreakers</em>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c14-endnote-18" id="c14-noteref-18">18</a></sup> Neither of these provides much information about the content of the encrypted messages.</p>
<p>According to Friedman’s report, the encrypted letters consisted of a series of numbers in groups of three, such as <code>7-11-3</code>, <code>8-5-6</code>, and <code>3-9-15</code>. After preliminary study, Friedman concluded that he was dealing with a book cipher. Each figure group seemed to refer to a page, line, and letter position in a certain book. For instance, <code>7-11-3</code> represented the third letter in line 11 on page 7.</p>
<p>Friedman had no idea which book the conspirators might have used. However, he realized that they had not applied their encryption method properly, as only the more important parts of the messages were encrypted. The parts left in cleartext provided Friedman with helpful hints regarding what the message was about. The ciphertext was also presented with word breaks, revealing the lengths of the words, and the senders chose the same number groupings to represent certain letters again and again, although it would have been more secure to refer to different pages, lines, and positions to encode the same character.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_297" title="297"/>Another poor technique used by the conspirators was consecutive sequences, such as <code>7-11-3</code>, <code>7-11-4</code>, <code>7-11-5</code>, and <code>7-11-6</code>, which revealed that a certain word or word part appeared in both the plaintext and the book. For example, the conspirators might have encrypted the plaintext word <code class="bold">APPLE</code> using the word <code class="bold">APPLE</code> in the key book, meaning the ciphertext numbers would have all been consecutive. Moreover, the senders often preferred the first appearance of a letter in a line, so frequent letters typically received low numbers while the rare ones were represented by higher numbers.</p>
<p>After considerable study, Friedman finally found a passage in one of the encrypted messages that appeared to represent the name of one of the suspects. We don’t know what this name was, but in his description of the incident, Kahn provides another example of a text fragment that Friedman could have guessed. Look at the following two encrypted words (each on a different line):</p>
<figure>
<img alt="83-1-2 83-1-11 83-1-25 83-1-1 83-1-8 83-1-13 83-1-18 83-1-3 83-1-1 83-1-6[line break]83-1-3 83-1-6" height="59" src="image_fi/502727c14/two-line-equation.png" width="913"/>

<p class="BodyCustom"><code>83-1-3 83-1-6</code></p>-->
<p>If we number each letter based on its order of appearance, then the letters in these two words form the pattern <code>1234567849 89</code>. Note that the characters <code>4</code>, <code>8</code>, and <code>9</code> are repeated; with modern cryptanalytic tools, this pattern could be solved quite quickly. Friedman noticed that the third character in the sequence, which appears in the ciphertext as <code>83-1-25</code>, has a higher number than the other characters, indicating that it was probably the twenty-fifth letter of a line in the book. Friedman suspected that this was a rare letter; otherwise, the position number would have been lower. Through a mixture of persistence, intuition, and luck, he was able to determine that the letter was <code class="bold">V</code> and that these two words were <code class="bold">REVOLUTION IN</code>.</p>
<p>Friedman later wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p class="Blockquote">From this, fragment by fragment, the plaintext of the messages was constructed, and not only the plaintext of the message, but we could state with reasonable certainty that on page so-and-so of the unknown book used, line so-and-so of that page, appeared the word “Germany.” In another page and line, “government,” and elsewhere, “constitution” and the like. From such evidence as that, we deduced that the subject matter of this unknown book was political economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the trial of the conspirators grew near, the Department of Justice told Friedman that they would find it helpful to know the title of the key book in order to convince the jury that the messages had been correctly decrypted. Friedman and his team consulted book dealers throughout the United States and England, asking for a book about political economy that contained certain words at certain positions. When the trial opened, however, the book had not been identified.</p>
<p>Friedman prepared to explain the cipher in court without referencing the book used—and then, while staying in a Chicago hotel, waiting for his testimony to be scheduled, he happened to walk past McClurg’s, Chicago’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_298" title="298"/>biggest bookstore. Rummaging through the political economy section, he found himself holding the book he’d been searching for: <em>Germany and the Germans</em>, by Price Collier (1913). The mystery was solved just in time.</p>
<p>When Friedman double-checked his work against the book, he found out that over 95% of his results were correct. Our sources don’t mention how Friedman’s testimony was received, but we know that quite a few of the Hindu conspirators were found guilty. This was the first major codebreaking success of Friedman’s career. Many others would follow.</p>

<p>Here’s a transcript of the encrypted note provided by crypto-hobbyists David Allen Wilson and Thomas Bosbach:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>31. August 2017</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>General R.E. Lee April 8th 1862</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>There are 45 R 1 here for 174 R 16 40 M 10. 228 L 33. More to 108 L 13. 250 R 18 of them, 153 R 22 239 L 29. Will 157 R 17. Can not the government 195 R 11 45 R 1 for the 176 M 23 250 R 18? I hope enough for 174 R 16 40 M 10 will 56 L 26 to-Morrow.</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>J.E. Johnston</code></p>
<p>The most likely explanation for this pattern is that the ciphertext passages are encrypted using a dictionary code, with the first number of each unit standing for the page, the letter for the column (left, middle, or right), and the second number for the line. The book, maybe an English dictionary, has at least 250 pages and thirty-three lines per page.</p>
<p>Above some of the units, somebody has already written what appears to be proposed plaintext representations. For instance, <code>45 R 1</code> is decrypted to <code class="bold">ARMS</code>, while <code>228 L 33</code> allegedly stands for <code class="bold">ROUTE</code>. Are these decryptions <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_299" title="299"/>correct? If so, why did the author only decrypt some of the words? Does that second sentence, starting with <code class="bold">ROUTE MORE TO</code>, even make sense? And is it plausible that the word <code class="bold">ARMS</code> is listed on page 45 of a 250-page dictionary, which might only have a few pages of words starting with the letter <em>A</em>? It is possible that the cipher involves additional tricks, like adding a number to the page number, but the encryption systems popular during the Civil War are generally not known to be so sophisticated.</p>
<p>Klaus didn’t know the answers to these questions when he introduced this encrypted message on his <em>Cipherbrain</em> blog in 2017. Several readers searched for a dictionary that could make sense of the ciphertext sections. This search was simplified by the requirements, as there weren’t too many English dictionaries published around the 1860s with three columns per page and about 250 pages. Finally, a reader nicknamed Davidsch found it: the <em>Noah Webster, William Greenleaf Webster Dictionary</em> from 1857. It immediately became clear that the alleged plaintext representations noted above some of the ciphertext units were wrong.</p>
<p>Using the dictionary, blog reader Thomas Bosbach soon provided the following decryption of the message (the plaintext decryptions are in parentheses):</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>There are 45R1 (cars) here for 174R16 (one) 40M10 (brigade). 228L33 (six) more to 108L13 (follow). 250R18 (three) of them, 153R22 (long-) 239L29 (street) will 157R17 (march).

<p class="BodyFirst">In 2018, Klaus introduced a dictionary code challenge on his blog.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c14-endnote-22" id="c14-noteref-22">22</a></sup> To create his dictionary, he first looked for a text file containing the 10,000 most popular words, acronyms, and initialisms of the English language, and then he made a few changes (adding words such as “ZZTOP,” deleting a few others, and so on) in order to foil any codebreaker trying to guess which file he had used. Next, he sorted the words alphabetically in a spreadsheet. The resulting list became his codebook, with each word referenced by its position in the list. Here are the start and the end of the list:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>0001: A</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>0002: AAA</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>0003: AAAA</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>0004: AACHEN</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>0005: AARON</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>0006: AATEAM</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>0007: AB</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>0008: ABANDONED</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>0009: ABC</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>0010: ABERDEEN</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>. . .</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>9992: ZONING</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>9993: ZOO</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>9994: ZOOM</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>9995: ZOOPHILIA</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>9996: ZOPE</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>9997: ZSHOP</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>9998: ZSHOPS</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>9999: ZUT</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>10000: ZZTOP</code></p>
<p>The word list contains not only full words and abbreviations but also the twenty-six letters of the alphabet. These are treated as ordinary words, which means, for instance, that <code class="bold">E</code> comes between <code class="bold">DYNAMICS</code> and <code class="bold">EACH</code>. If a word one wants to encrypt does not appear on the dictionary list, it can be encoded letter by letter. Using this codebook, Klaus encrypted a plaintext consisting of about seventy words, which resulted in the following ciphertext:</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">In 1873, two encrypted newspaper ads were published in London’s <em>Daily Telegraph</em>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c14-endnote-23" id="c14-noteref-23">23</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c14-endnote-24" id="c14-noteref-24">24</a></sup> They are reproduced here.

<p>Both ads mainly consist of number groups divided into two parts by a period or comma. The numbers before the period/comma are smaller than the ones after it, a pattern consistent with a book cipher. An expression such as <code>12.269</code> might stand for the 269th letter on page twelve of a certain book. The <code>X</code> at the end of some groups might mean that, instead of one letter, the group represents a whole word. Not much more is known about these two cryptograms.</p>

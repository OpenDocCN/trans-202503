			</header>
			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="293"/>Historically, one of the names of vector editors was <em>vector
drawing</em>—or simply <em>drawing</em>—applications. 
Bitmap editors, on the other hand, are sometimes
called <em>paint programs</em>. The contrast between drawing and painting,
stemming from traditional media (paper versus canvas), is thus carried on into the digital realm. Even though vector programs are now
used—perhaps even preferentially—for higher-level tasks, such as
composition and layout, simply <em>drawing</em> is still the most basic use case for this
kind of tool.</p>
			<p>It is true that vector drawings can never be as naturalistic and "painterly" as bitmaps; even
the best vector art has that recognizable smooth, computer-generated look. Often,
however, this is not a problem—it can even be an advantage. Also, vector editors
have something that no bitmap editor can match: the ability to treat each stroke as a
separate object that never merges or "flattens" into others (unless you tell it to).  As
it turns out, this infinite tweakability is sometimes more important for producing a
good freehand drawing than the ability to imitate pastel strokes or wet-on-wet
watercolor.</p>
			<p><a id="294"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_294" title="294"/>Inkscape has a number of drawing tools to choose from, depending on the type of 
art you want to create (<a href="#fig14-1">Figure 14-1</a>). If you need straight-line geometry or spline-shaped paths with precise
placement of nodes, use the Pen tool (<a href="#section14.1.1">14.1.1</a>). For freehand paths, more or less smoothed out,
use the Pencil tool (<a href="#section14.1.2">14.1.2</a>). For complex, naturalistic,
pressure-sensitive filled strokes imitating various physical effects, such as trembling
or inertia, use the Calligraphic pen (<a href="#section14.2">14.2</a>). To do cartoon-like fillings
between multiple complex strokes, Inkscape has the Paint Bucket tool (<a href="#section14.3">14.3</a>).</p>

			<p>
				A number of other tools deserve an honorable mention in this chapter on drawing.
You can quite literally draw with copies or clones of objects using the Spray tool (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.7">4.7</a>).
The Tweak tool is essential for artwork creation, whether you use it for shuffling your strokes around (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.10">6.10</a>),
applying color (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.9">8.9</a>), or freehand path pushing (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.6">12.6</a>).
You can use the Eraser tool (<a href="#section14.4">14.4</a>) to wipe out parts of your drawing.
Finally, Inkscape has a specialized Connector tool 
for drawing diagrams (<a href="#section14.5">14.5</a>).</p>
			<p>
				This chapter would be incomplete without mentioning that you can easily rotate
Inkscape's canvas, with all its contents, using Ctrl-Shift-wheel (<a href="c03.xhtml#section3.13">3.13</a>).
You can also flip (mirror) the canvas with commands in the <span class="ui">View<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Canvas Orientation</span> submenu.
For an artist, the ability
to place the drawing at the most convenient angle for stroking is a big help.</p>
			<a id="section14.1"/><h2>14.1 The Pen and Pencil Tools</h2>
			<p>Traditionally, ink pens are associated with writing and draftsmanship, and graphite pencils with artistic sketching
and drawing. In Inkscape, the sibling Pen and Pencil tools are both used for creating paths.
The difference is that you use the Pen when you want to control placement of individual nodes, whereas the Pencil is for freehand doodles
where Inkscape takes care of the nodes and other details. As all metaphors are,
this one is somewhat arbitrary, but it has stuck.</p>
			<p>
				In this section, I first describe the basic operation of Pen and Pencil and then look at the advanced
features—drawing modes and stroke shapes—that these tools have in common and that make use of
path effects (<a href="c13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a>).</p>
			<a id="section14.1.1"/><h3>
				14.1.1 <a id="295"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_295" title="295"/>The Pen Tool</h3>
			<p>
				The Pen tool, where you create individual nodes by clicking the canvas, is reminiscent of the
Node tool (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5">12.5</a>) except it is optimized for creating new nodes instead of editing them.</p>
			<p>Switch to the Pen tool (Shift-F6 or B), make sure it is in the default
Bézier mode (the leftmost button on the controls bar), and click the
canvas. You have created a first node of a new path. Just moving the mouse around (without clicking) moves a red
segment that shows you how the path will go if you create the next node where you are.</p>
			<p>
				Keep clicking
to add more nodes. To finish the path, double-click (this adds one more node and finishes
the path), or right-click, or press Enter (both these methods finish the path and cancel the red segment without adding any
more nodes). It is only at this point that the entire path is actually
created as an object; what you saw until now was just a virtual scaffold. Another
way to finish a path is to <em>close</em> it; if you create the next node exactly over the
first node of the path (it is marked by a square anchor), the path is closed and
finalized.</p>
			<p>
				If you click and drag instead of just clicking, you're creating a smooth Bézier node (<a href="#fig14-2">Figure 14-2</a>); the blue
straight line with round handle(s) at the end(s) that moves while you drag is the single handle (for the start node)
or two symmetric handles (for a mid-node, <a href="c12.xhtml#section12.1.4">12.1.4</a>). As soon as you release the mouse button,
the node's handles are fixed (but the path is still being created).</p>
			<a id="fig14-2"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-pen1.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-2: Pen: first node set, ready for the second</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				After you create the second node, the part
of the path between the two nodes defined so far becomes green, and you
once again have a red segment stretching from the last created node (<a href="#fig14-3">Figure 14-3</a>).
You can repeat this indefinitely—keep
clicking and dragging (for smooth symmetric nodes) or just clicking (for cusp
nodes); on each step, the path you have laid out so far is green, and
the last segment you are about to create is red.</p>

better position your next node.</p>

			<h4>14.1.1.1 Node Types</h4>
			<p>
				As you've just seen, click-and-drag creates a smooth node with two symmetric handles
(unless this is a first node of a path that has only one handle). 
A simple click creates a cusp node without any
handles. You can also create cusp nodes with noncollinear handles; for this, click-and-drag, but
then, once the opposite handle is where you want it, press Shift while dragging.
This fixes the far handle and lets you move the near handle independently, as <a href="#fig14-4">Figure 14-4</a> demonstrates.</p>
			<a id="fig14-4"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-pen3.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-4: Creating cusp nodes with the Pen</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				You can also press Ctrl while dragging a handle to snap it to 15-degree
increments (compare <a href="c06.xhtml#section6.3">6.3</a>; you can choose another snap value in <span class="ui">Preferences<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Behavior<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Steps</span>). Pressing
Ctrl while moving the mouse around between creating nodes will similarly snap the
direction between the last created node and the mouse point; this is an easy way to create
strictly horizontal or vertical lines, as shown in <a href="#fig14-5">Figure 14-5</a>.</p>

			</figure>
			<a id="section14.1.1.2"/>
			<h4>14.1.1.2 Going Back</h4>
			<p>You can always step back in your path creation process. To cancel
the last added green segment, press Backspace or Delete once, or press it repeatedly to remove several segments.
Removing the last
remaining node cancels the entire path.</p>
			<p>
				It is not always easy to click exactly where you want the node to appear on the first
attempt. Inkscape allows you to move the last created node (that is, the end of the green
segment) without finalizing the path by using the arrow keys with the same convenient
modifiers as in other tools: Alt to move by 1 screen pixel,
Shift to move by 10 times the distance (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.5.1">6.5.1</a>).</p>
			<a id="section14.1.1.3"/><h4>14.1.1.3 Continuing a Path</h4>
			<p>
				When you're in the Pen tool, any single selected path displays its end nodes, if it has any (that is, if it is
open), as little square <em>anchors</em>. (This is the case for any path you just created with this tool
itself—after finalizing, it remains selected.) <a id="297"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_297" title="297"/>These anchors allow you to continue adding to 
the selected path (by placing your first node in the anchor) or to close it (by penning from
one anchor to the other).</p>
			<p>
				You can also add a new subpath (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.1.1">12.1.1</a>) to the selected path. To do
this, just hold down Shift <em>while</em> you click to create the first
node. After that, create and finalize the path as usual; your path
will be added as a subpath to the selected path. All open subpaths
of the selected path show anchors, which means you can close them or
connect them to one another (<a href="#fig14-6">Figure 14-6</a>).</p>

			<h3>14.1.2 The Pencil Tool</h3>
			<p>The Pencil tool (F6 or P) is similar to the Pen tool.
The main difference is that with the Pencil, you don't
worry about individual nodes or handles; you just draw a freehand line and Inkscape
approximates it with a path.</p>
			<a id="section14.1.2.1"/><h4>14.1.2.1 Smoothing</h4>
			<p>
				When you draw with the Pencil, the resulting path is always smoother than the actual trace of your mouse drag.
To change how much smoothing is applied, use the <span class="ui">Smoothing</span> section of the tool's controls bar. Smaller 
values of <span class="ui">Smoothing</span> produce more precise and node-rich approximations of what you have drawn;
conversely, larger values create more generic and simplified paths with fewer nodes (<a href="#fig14-7">Figure 14-7</a>). At the maximum of 100, most mouse drags
will create just a single Bézier segment between two nodes.</p>
			<a id="fig14-7"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-pencil.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-7: Pencil strokes at various smoothing levels</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Next to the numeric <span class="ui">Smoothing</span> value, a toggle button called<span class="ui">LPE based interactive smoothing</span> controls how the smoothing function works. With this button
unpressed, you activate the old method where smoothing, at the specified level, is applied once when the path is finalized, and
the unsmoothed source path is discarded. This way, smoothing is applied only to newly created paths in the Pencil
tool and cannot be changed afterward.</p>
			<p>
				With this button pressed (now the default), instead, the source path is stored at
the minimum level of smoothing but then a <span class="ui">Simplify</span> path effect (<a href="c13.xhtml#section13.3.4.4">13.3.4.4</a>) is applied to it. This method of smoothing is fully
reversible (you can just remove the path effect) and adjustable (you can change the amount of smoothing, whether via
the effect's parameters in the <span class="ui">Path Effects</span> dialog or simply by varying <a id="298"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_298" title="298"/>the <span class="ui">Smoothing</span> value in the Pencil
tool's controls bar when any path with the <span class="ui">Simplify</span> effect is selected). If you like the interactivity of the new method but don't want
paths with path effects in your document, the <span class="ui">Flatten</span> button will remove the effect and produce a bare path at the
current <span class="ui">Smoothing</span> level.</p>
			<p>
				This approach is wonderful in theory, but its implementation has some kinks. I found that if you want the absolute minimum
of smoothing, you should set the value to 1 (out of the maximum of 100), not zero. Also, at lower values of <span class="ui">Smoothing</span>, the<span class="ui">Simplify</span> path effect sometimes produces more, not fewer, nodes than the original had.</p>
			<a id="section14.1.2.2"/><h4>14.1.2.2 Pressure Sensitivity</h4>
			<p>
				There was a time when the only tool in Inkscape that used the pressure signal of a tablet pen
was the Calligraphic Pen (<a href="#section14.2">14.2</a>).
Over time, it was joined by Tweak (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.10">6.10</a>, <a href="c08.xhtml#section8.9">8.9</a>, <a href="c12.xhtml#section12.6">12.6</a>),
Eraser (<a href="#section14.4">14.4</a>), Spray (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.7">4.7</a>) tools. Now, the Pencil tool can also use a pressure-sensitive
input device to create paths with variable stroke width. It does this via the <span class="ui">Power stroke</span>
path effect (<a href="c13.xhtml#section13.3.1.1">13.3.1.1</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Enable pressure-sensitive drawing by clicking a toggle button on the controls bar. Now the <span class="ui">Shape</span> controls (<a href="#section14.1.5">14.1.5</a>)
are gone (because the pressure-controlled strokes cannot have a predefined shape), and the drawing
mode buttons (<a href="#section14.1.4">14.1.4</a>) are disabled. Instead, you see numeric controls
for the minimum and maximum width (which correspond to the minimum and maximum pressure of the pen), as well as
a drop-down for choosing the type of stroke caps. These controls apply only to the newly created strokes; if you want
to change width or caps in an existing stroke, you can do so via the <span class="ui">Power stroke</span> path effect it has (<a href="c13.xhtml#section13.3.1.1">13.3.1.1</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Pressure-enabled drawing leaves a trail of red circles; their sizes indicate the pressure in each point, and their spacing is determined
by the speed of your pen movement. Once you lift the pen, a path with <span class="ui">Power stroke</span> is created that approximates
(with some smoothing) the pressure data recorded during your stroke, as shown in <a href="#fig14-8">Figure 14-8</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig14-8"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-pencil-pressure.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-8: Drawing with the Pencil using a pressure-sensitive tablet pen</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<a id="section14.1.2.3"/>
			<h4>14.1.2.3 Continuing a Path</h4>
			<p>Similar to the Pen tool, in the Pencil tool, any selected path displays anchors on the open end
nodes of all its subpaths. You can continue, close, and connect subpaths by drawing from
one such anchor to another, and you can add new subpaths to the selected shape by
beginning to draw with Shift held down.</p>
			<a id="section14.1.2.4"/><h4>
				14.1.2.4 <a id="299"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_299" title="299"/>Sketching with Alt</h4>
			<p>
				Drawing with Alt in the Pencil tool enables <em>sketching</em>.
Any number of drags that you do before letting go of Alt will be<em>averaged</em>, and that single averaged path will be created only after you release Alt.
You can think of this as an inversion of what the <span class="ui">Sketch</span> path effect does (<a href="c13.xhtml#section13.3.4.1">13.3.4.1</a>).
Sketching allows you to "feel your way" when drawing—to zero in on the best line without creating
a thicket of tentative discardables.</p>
			<p>
				On the Pencil tool's <span class="ui">Preferences</span> page, the <span class="ui">Average all
sketches</span> setting (on by default) averages <em>all</em> sketching strokes made while you hold
Alt with equal weight. If you turn it off, the tool will average between the latest
stroke and the previous average, thereby giving your latest stroke more weight.</p>
			<a id="section14.1.3"/><h3>14.1.3 Style</h3>
			<p>
				Like all object-creating tools, the Pen and Pencil tools can use either the last set style or
their own tool style (<a href="c11.xhtml#section11.1.2">11.1.2</a>). By default, they use their own style, which is initially
set to no fill, 1 px black stroke. This is because more often than not, the last set
style has fill and no stroke, whereas when drawing with these tools, you likely want
the result to have stroke but not necessarily fill. Refer to <a href="c11.xhtml#fig11-2">Figure 11-2</a>
for how to change the tool style. As usual, the style that
will be used for the next path you create is displayed on the right end of the controls
bar (shown in <a href="c11.xhtml#fig11-1">Figure 11-1</a>).</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">

				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						When using a <span class="ui">Shape</span> other than <span class="ui">None</span> (<a href="#section14.1.5">14.1.5</a>), you
may not be able to create fill at all because the path effect that is applied to such strokes
emulates shaped stroke with a closed filled path. In that case, Inkscape does what you'd
expect: it applies the <em>stroke</em> properties of the tool's style to the<em>fill</em>. Thus, if <span class="ui">None</span> creates a black stroke with no fill,<span class="ui">Ellipse</span> will create an ellipse-shaped stroke with black fill but no
stroke (<a href="#fig14-11">Figure 14-11</a>).
However, if no stroke is set in the tool style, the style's fill properties (if any) will be used for the shaped path.</p>

			<h3>14.1.4 Drawing modes</h3>
			<p>
				Both Pen and Pencil have a number of modes, apart from the default <em>Bézier mode</em>, that let you create
paths out of other types of splines or segments. These correspond to the <span class="ui">Mode:</span> buttons on the controls bars of these tools (<a href="#fig14-9">Figure 14-9</a>). 
The first button is the default mode that creates regular SVG paths out of straight lines and Bézier curves.</p>
			<a id="fig14-9"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-pen-modes.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-9: The modes in the Pen tool (Pencil doesn't have the last two)</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="300"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_300" title="300"/>The second mode creates <em>Spiro paths</em>—that is, paths with the <span class="ui">Spiro spline</span>
path effect applied  (<a href="c13.xhtml#section13.3.7.2">13.3.7.2</a>). In this mode, a simple click in Pen creates a smooth node, and a Shift-click
creates a cusp node; there's no way to create a half-smooth node (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5.5">12.5.5</a>).</p>
			<p>
				The Pencil tool,
as you've seen (<a href="#section14.1.2.1">14.1.2.1</a>), first applies some smoothing to your hand-drawn stroke, by
default using the <span class="ui">Simplify</span> path effect. Then, it applies the <span class="ui">Spiro spline</span> effect on top of <span class="ui">Simplify</span>.
Since, at the (default) low values of <span class="ui">Smoothing</span>, <span class="ui">Simplify</span> tends to produce <em>more</em> nodes than the original path had,
the result may not look very much like a Spiro at all—because the extra nodes added by <span class="ui">Simplify</span> make Spiro
track the path unusually closely. If you're puzzled by this, just remove <span class="ui">Simplify</span> from the effects stack of the path.</p>
			<p>
				The third button creates <em>BSpline paths</em>—that is, paths with the <span class="ui">BSpline</span>
path effect applied  (<a href="c13.xhtml#section13.3.7.1">13.3.7.1</a>). In this mode, a simple click in Pen creates a smooth off-curve
node, and a Shift-click creates a cusp node.</p>
			<p>
				The two other modes (Pen-only) are restrictions of the regular mode. The <em>Straight lines</em>
mode disables creation of smooth nodes: even if you drag, you end up with a cusp node without handles.
The <em>Paraxial</em> mode additionally restricts
the segments to being parallel or perpendicular to the first segment you create in a path; additionally, each segment is perpendicular to
the one that precedes it. For example, if you restrict the first segment to vertical by pressing Ctrl,
the next segment will be horizontal, then vertical, then horizontal again, and so on. That may not be much of a trick,
but the true usefulness of this drawing mode is its ability to draw within a slanted coordinate system: just draw the first
segment at the correct angle and then keep going in this rotated world.</p>
			<p>
				In the Straight lines and Paraxial modes, if you Ctrl-click without creating a path,
you create a single <em>dot</em>—a little circle shape (<a href="c11.xhtml#section11.4">11.4</a>). This is
convenient in geometric and technical drawings.
You can set the size of the Ctrl-click dots, in units of stroke width, in 
the Pen tool's
preferences (double-click the tool icon in the toolbox to access its page in the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog); the
default is three stroke widths. If you use Shift-Ctrl, the dot is twice as big (<a href="#fig14-10">Figure 14-10</a>).</p>

			<a id="section14.1.5"/>
			<h3>14.1.5 Stroke Shapes</h3>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Shape</span> drop-down menu for the Pen and Pencil tools lets you choose the
shape of the stroke for the path you are creating.
The <span class="ui">Scale</span> value next to it adjusts the width of the shaped stroke (in relative units).
In Pencil, these controls are shown only if you don't
have pressure sensitivity enabled (<a href="#section14.1.2.2">14.1.2.2</a>).</p>
			<p><a id="301"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_301" title="301"/>By itself, SVG does not support shaped strokes; in SVG, a stroke is always a
constant-width strip (<a href="c09.xhtml#ch9">Chapter 9</a>). All other stroke shapes are emulated by Inkscape via
path effects (<a href="c13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a>). That is why there's a difference in behavior
between the default <span class="ui">None</span> and the rest of the stroke shapes in this list (<a href="#fig14-11">Figure 14-11</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig14-11"/><figure>

				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-11: Shaped strokes with the Pen tool</p>

			</figure>
			<p>
				With <span class="ui">None</span>, you get the barebones SVG path with a plain, constant-width
stroke. Here's what the tool does for the other <span class="ui">Shape</span> options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Two triangles: <span class="ui">Triangle in</span> <em>decreases</em> the width to zero toward the end of the path, and <span class="ui">Triangle  out</span> <em>increases</em> the width toward the end. These are created using the <span class="ui">Power stroke</span> path effect (<a href="c13.xhtml#section13.3.1.1">13.3.1.1</a>).  To adjust width, use the Pen or Pencil's  					<span class="ui"><strong>Scale</strong></span> control or drag the onscreen purple-colored handle in the Node tool.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Ellipse</span>: a circle with the diameter of 10 px is applied using the <span class="ui">Pattern Along  Path</span> effect to your path (<a href="c13.xhtml#section13.3.2">13.3.2</a>). To adjust width, use the Pen or Pencil's  					<span class="ui"><strong>Scale</strong></span> control or the onscreen handle (perpendicular at the end node) in the Node tool.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">From clipboard</span>: any path you had copied to the clipboard gets applied to the path you draw as a pattern using the <span class="ui">Pattern Along   Path</span> path effect (<a href="c13.xhtml#section13.3.2">13.3.2</a>). To adjust width, use the Pen or Pencil's  					<span class="ui"><strong>Scale</strong></span> control or the onscreen handle (perpendicular at the end node) in the Node tool.  To edit the shape of the stroke, use the <span class="ui"><strong>Show next editable path effect parameter</strong></span> button in the Node tool (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5.1">12.5.1</a>). 					<p>For example, if you create a line of text and convert it to a single path, copy it, and choose this option in the Pencil, each stroke will be painted by this line of text (appropriately bent and stretched).</p>
				</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Bend from clipboard</span>: any path you had copied to the clipboard gets applied to the path you draw as a skeleton using the <span class="ui">Bend</span> path effect (<a href="c13.xhtml#section13.3.2.2">13.3.2.2</a>). For example, if you create an arc, copy it, and choose this option in the Pencil, <a id="302"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_302" title="302"/>each freehand doodle you create will be <em>bent</em> by this arc, on top of its own shape.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Last applied</span>: whatever shape you used with this tool the last time will be used again. Why is this useful? You can create a brush shape, copy it, apply it to a Pen or Pencil stroke once using <span class="ui">From clipboard</span>, then switch it to <span class="ui">Last applied</span> and keep using this brush so that the clipboard can be used for other things.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The path you create may or may not have a fill inside it, depending on the style the tool
uses (<a href="#section14.1.3">14.1.3</a>). With <span class="ui">Power stroke</span>,
you cannot have any fill <em>inside the path</em>, because the tool automatically applies the
style of stroke to the fill and discards the original stroke style.
With <span class="ui">Pattern Along Path</span>, however, you can have fill <em>inside the pattern</em> that is stretched
along your path. With <span class="ui">Bend</span>, you can have both fill and stroke as with the default <span class="ui">None</span>.</p>
			<p>
				Path effects creating stroke shapes are added on top of any other effects that the Pen
or Pencil tools add, including <span class="ui">Spiro spline</span> or <span class="ui">BSpline</span> (both Pen and Pencil) and <span class="ui">Simplify</span> (Pencil only). For example,
if you draw a Spiro path with the Ellipse shape, then switch to the Node tool and adjust the
Spiro nodes, the entire elliptical shape will bend and curl along the Spiro spline.
In the <span class="ui">Path Effect Editor</span> dialog for this path, you will find both <span class="ui">Spiro spline</span> and <span class="ui">Pattern Along Path</span> effects stacked on top of each other.
To turn a path with any path effect(s) into a regular path, use the <span class="ui"><strong>Object
to Path</strong></span> command (Shift-Ctrl-C).</p>

			<h2>14.2 The Calligraphic Pen Tool</h2>
			<p>
				The name <em>Inkscape</em> is quite apt: the most sophisticated drawing
tool in the program, the Calligraphic pen, feels <em>inky</em> indeed. As its name
implies, this tool was initially intended for calligraphy—that is, beautiful handcrafted
lettering.  With time, however, it became more versatile and is now used for general artistic sketching,
drawing, and inking.</p>
			<p>
				Switch to the Calligraphic pen (Ctrl-F6 or C) and drag on
the canvas. Inkscape will create a filled path, its width and shape
depending on the angle of the stroke, the speed of dragging, and the pressure of your
pen (if you are using a pressure-sensitive tablet). The result may be similar to the Pencil tool
in the pressure-sensitive mode (<a href="#section14.1.2.2">14.1.2.2</a>), but the Calligraphic pen
has a lot more <a id="303"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_303" title="303"/>options and behavior subtleties. 
The result of this tool is always a plain filled path without any path effects.</p>
			<a id="section14.2.1"/><h3>14.2.1 Width</h3>
			<p>
				The most important
setting on the tool's controls bar is <span class="ui">Width</span>, specifying the width of the stroke
(or more precisely, its <em>maximum</em> width; other factors may also affect width,
but it will never exceed the value you set here), as shown in <a href="#fig14-13">Figure 14-13</a>. You can adjust the width value with
the ← and → keys at any time while using the
Calligraphic pen tool.</p>
			<a id="fig14-13"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-width.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-13: Calligraphic pen: varying width (pressure sensitivity is off)</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Along with the absolute units (px, mm, and so on), you can also set the tool's width in relative units (<span class="ui">%</span>),
which makes the width relative to the size of your document window, not to any objects
or measurements in the document. In other words, if you zoom out, your stroke will be
wider in absolute units but will <em>look</em> exactly the same width to you. The value of 1
always gives a hairline, and 100 always gives a stroke about 2 centimeters wide as
measured on your screen.</p>
			<p>
				This approach may seem strange at first, but it has the advantage that you can always have the same <em>feel</em> for the tool, no matter what 
your level of zoom is, providing for an intuitive workflow. First, you zoom out and lay down the
main broad strokes of your drawing; then, you zoom in to add finer and finer details—all without shifting
the <span class="ui">Width</span> back and forth.</p>
			<a id="section14.2.1.1"/><h4>14.2.1.1 Pressure Sensitivity</h4>
			<p>
				If you have a pressure-sensitive tablet as your input device, Inkscape can use
the pressure information to change the width of the stroke: press lightly for a thin
line, press harder for a wider brush (<a href="#fig14-14">Figure 14-14</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig14-14"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-pressure.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-14: Calligraphic pen: drawing with or without pressure sensitivity (Width is the same)</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				To enable pressure sensitivity, click the toggle
button to the right of the <span class="ui"><strong>Width</strong></span> control. Without pressure sensitivity, the
tool draws as if maximum pressure is applied.</p>
			<a id="section14.2.1.2"/><h4>
				14.2.1.2 <a id="304"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_304" title="304"/>Tracing Background</h4>
			<p>
				Another thing that can affect the width of the Calligraphic pen stroke—if you enable
it—is the darkness of the color of the background over which you are
drawing: your brush is at its thinnest when you draw over white and at its broadest when you
draw over black. This is most useful when you use <em>guide tracking</em> (<a href="#section14.2.7">14.2.7</a>) to
create a hatching over an existing drawing or bitmap and want to achieve a shading
effect with strokes of smoothly varying width, as shown in <a href="#fig14-15">Figure 14-15</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig14-15"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-tracing.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-15: Calligraphic pen: tracking background by width</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				To enable tracing the background, click the next toggle button
after the <span class="ui"><strong>Pressure Sensitivity</strong></span> toggle. You can combine this setting with <span class="ui">Pressure Sensitivity</span>, although
it usually makes sense to turn <span class="ui">Pressure Sensitivity</span> off when you're tracing.</p>
			<a id="section14.2.1.3"/><h4>14.2.1.3 Thinning by Speed</h4>
			<p>
				Finally, the speed of your drawing—how fast you're dragging the mouse or pen—may
also affect the width of your stroke. This is controlled by the <span class="ui">Thinning</span> value,
which takes values from –100 to 100 (<a href="#fig14-16">Figure 14-16</a>). Positive values make your stroke thinner as you go
faster; negative values make it thicker. If you set this parameter to 0, thinning by
speed is disabled.</p>
			<a id="fig14-16"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-thinning.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-16: Calligraphic pen: thinning by speed (pressure sensitivity is off)</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Since a stroking movement is usually faster in the middle of a drag, 
the result is a shape with a fixed width at the ends and a "breathing" middle—thinner for positive values of this
parameter. Pressure sensitivity usually has the opposite effect, as pressure in the
middle of a stroke is typically higher than at the ends. An interplay of these two
factors gives the tool its natural feel.</p>
			<p>A real-world felt pen or pencil usually leaves a thinner trail when you move it
faster; the default value for this parameter is set to 10 to emulate this
behavior. However, you can also push it all the way to –100 or to 100, which produces
curiously "exploding" or "imploding" strokes very much unlike anything in the real world!</p>
			<a id="section14.2.2"/><h3>
				14.2.2 <a id="305"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_305" title="305"/>Angle</h3>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Angle</span> and <span class="ui">Fixation</span> parameters treat the Calligraphic pen
as a flat-tipped calligraphic pen that can be held at a varying angle (<a href="#fig14-17">Figure 14-17</a>). The <span class="ui">Angle</span> sets the angle of the pen's tip to the horizontal:
0 is horizontal, +90 is rotated all the way to the vertical
counterclockwise, and –90 is rotated clockwise. You can also change this value
by pressing the ↑ (increase) or ↓ (decrease) arrow
keys.</p>
			<a id="fig14-17"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-angle.svg.png"/>

					<p>
						Figure 14-17: Calligraphic pen: the <span class="ui">Angle</span> and <span class="ui">Fixation</span></p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Setting an angle with a nonzero fixation is most useful for producing calligraphic
lettering. For most styles of calligraphy, the angle should be somewhere between 30 and 60
degrees.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						If your tablet supports pen angle detection, you can, for extra realism, bind the<span class="ui">Angle</span> parameter of the tool to the actual physical angle of your pen. For this, just
press the toggle button next to the <span class="ui"><strong>Angle</strong></span> slider.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Fixation</span> (in the range of 0 to 100) controls how strictly the <span class="ui">Angle</span> is
enforced. When <span class="ui">Fixation</span> is at its maximum, the tip is always rotated at the set
angle, regardless of the direction of your stroke—so that drawing
parallel to the pen angle always gives a hairline stroke, whereas drawing perpendicular to it
produces maximum width. With zero <span class="ui">Fixation</span>, the direction of the pen is always
perpendicular to the direction of movement, which makes <span class="ui">Angle</span> irrelevant and
gives you the effect of a felt-tip pen or a round brush. Intermediate values of<span class="ui">Fixation</span> produce a stroke that is affected <em>both</em> by <span class="ui">Angle</span> and the direction of 
movement, in varying proportions.</p>
			<a id="section14.2.3"/><h3>14.2.3 Caps</h3>
			<p>
				By default, Calligraphic pen strokes are cut blunt at the ends. This is best for
calligraphy work, but at other times you may want a more rounded appearance. Increase
the <span class="ui">Caps</span> parameter to about 0.5 for slight bulges at the ends, to 1.3 for
approximately round caps, and up to 5 for long, protruding caps, as shown in <a href="#fig14-18">Figure 14-18</a>.</p>

			<h3>
				14.2.4 <a id="306"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_306" title="306"/>Tremor, Wiggle, and Mass</h3>
			<p>
				What you've seen so far of the Calligraphic pen tool is useful, if maybe a little
boring. It's time to add some fun! The last three parameters—<span class="ui">Tremor</span>, <span class="ui">Wiggle</span>, and <span class="ui">Mass</span> (all
in the range of 0 to 100)—modify the behavior of the tool in some uncommon
ways.</p>
			<p>Even when using a graphics tablet with pressure sensitivity, the Calligraphy pen's
brush strokes often look too smooth and computer-ish. Increasing tremor adds
small-scale disturbances to the stroke for a more natural look—rough, trembling, or
even splotchy. The frequency of the tremor is temporal, rather than spatial, which means
if you draw faster, the roughness will be stretched along the stroke and
therefore look smoother.</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Wiggle</span> parameter also disturbs the stroke but at a larger
scale, making it waver in wavy or loopy patterns, departing sometimes quite far
from the actual position of the cursor, especially at sharp turns (<a href="#fig14-19">Figure 14-19</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig14-19"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-tremor-wiggle.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-19: Calligraphic pen: effects of tremor (left) and wiggle (right)</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><span class="ui">Mass</span> makes the brush lag behind the cursor, as if slowed down by inertia,
resulting in smoothing of sharp corners and shortening of the fast flights of your
pen. The default settings for tremor and wiggle are 0, but mass 
has a small nonzero default value (2 out of 100) so that the Calligraphic pen feels light
and responsive but not entirely weightless.</p>
			<a id="section14.2.5"/><h3>14.2.5 Calligraphic Presets</h3>
			<p>The Calligraphic pen is one of the most settings-rich tools in Inkscape.
Of course, tweaking several sliders and buttons every time you want to switch from a smooth marker pen to a wiggly
brush is time-consuming. Presets are a solution to this problem:
you can set multiple parameters at once by choosing one of the presets from the drop-down menu on the left end of the toolbar.
Several presets come with the program:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><span class="ui">Dip pen</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Is an imitation of a soft calligraphy pen: smooth (no tremor or
wiggle), pressure-sensitive, angle fixed at 30 degrees, no caps rounding.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Marker</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Is a plain, constant-width, felt-tip marker: smooth, no pressure
sensitivity, no speed thinning, no angle fixation, round caps.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui"><a id="307"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_307" title="307"/>Brush</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Compared to <span class="ui">Marker</span>, adds pressure sensitivity, negative thinning
(the stroke is wider when you move faster), and some wiggle.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Wiggly</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>As its name implies, features high wiggle and some tremor for a
characteristic "dirty" look.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Splotchy</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Is a very wide brush with high tremor and high negative thinning,
which can produce a series of "splotches" connected by thin streaks (<a href="#fig14-16">Figure 14-16</a>, right).</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Tracing</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Is similar to <span class="ui">Marker</span> but with the background tracing feature
turned on (<a href="#section14.2.1.2">14.2.1.2</a>).</p>
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>To add a new preset with the current parameters, click the button next to the presets list and provide a name for your preset.</p>
			<a id="section14.2.6"/>
			<h3>14.2.6 Adding and Subtracting</h3>
			<p>
				If a single path was selected before you started drawing, holding Shift
when you release the mouse button or lift the pen will <em>add</em>
the new stroke you just created to the selected path, forming a new single path
via the <span class="ui">Union</span> path operation (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.2">12.2</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Similarly, holding Alt 
will <em>subtract</em> (via the <span class="ui">Difference</span> operation) the new stroke from the selected
path. This makes it
easy to quickly "patch" or "carve" any path.
The Cut mode of the Eraser tool (<a href="#section14.4">14.4</a>) works the same, so you can also use
this functionality in a separate tool without having to hold Alt.</p>
			<a id="section14.2.7"/><h3>14.2.7 Tracking a Guide Path</h3>
			<p>
				Drawing in the Calligraphic pen with Ctrl pressed activates the <em>guide
tracking</em> feature, which causes your pen to slide at some constant distance from the edge of
a selected <em>guide path</em> and lets you trace around or along that guide.</p>
			<p>
				The inspiration for this feature came from the traditional line engraving techniques
that, for a long time, were the only practical way of reproducing lifelike shading in
black-and-white print; about a century ago, line engravings were almost completely
replaced by automatic halftone screens. <em>Hatching</em>—filling space with many
parallel straight or curved lines of varying width to represent gradual
shading—is a very labor-intensive process. Inkscape's guide tracking, along with
background tracing (<a href="#section14.2.1.2">14.2.1.2</a>) and the Tweak tool
(<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.6">12.6</a>), take the pain and boredom out of this ancient art.
While you still need a keen eye and a lot of assiduousness, with Inkscape you can
create authentic-looking line engravings, entirely in vector, in a reasonable amount
of time.</p>
			<p>
				One way to approximate a hatching grid is by using path interpolation (for example, with the <span class="ui">Interpolate Sub-Paths</span> effect, <a href="c13.xhtml#section13.3.9.2">13.3.9.2</a>), but this
method is not very flexible and produces obviously computer-generated output that lacks a
"human touch." Manual hatching, on the other hand, is tedious and
nearly <a id="308"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_308" title="308"/>impossible to do uniformly enough. The guide tracking capability allows you to hatch
quickly and uniformly yet not too perfectly, and you have considerable manual control over the process.</p>
			<p>
				Here's how to do it. First, select the <em>guide path</em> that you will track. It
may be another calligraphic stroke, any path or shape, or even a letter of a text
object. Switch to the Calligraphic pen tool and, before starting to
draw, press Ctrl. You will see a gray <em>track circle</em> centered at your mouse pointer
touching the closest point on the selected guide path. (If you have no guide path
selected, a status bar message will tell you to select it.)</p>
			<p>
				Now, move your mouse closer to the guide path, so that the track circle radius is
equal to the desired spacing of your hatch pattern, and start drawing along the guide
path. As soon as you start drawing, the radius of the circle locks and the circle
turns green. Now the circle slides along the guide path—and the actual stroke is drawn
by the center of the tracking circle, <em>not</em> by your mouse point. As a result, you
create a smooth stroke that goes parallel to the guide path, always at the same
distance from it (<a href="#fig14-20">Figure 14-20</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig14-20"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-hatch1.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-20: Calligraphic pen: tracking a guide path</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				When the stroke is ready, release your mouse button (or lift your tablet
pen). However, do not let go of Ctrl yet, because so long as you have it pressed,
the tool remembers the hatch spacing you set when you started drawing. Since you have
just created a new stroke, that stroke object is selected instead of what was selected before—which
means it now becomes the new guide path. Next, draw a second stroke along the first one,
then a third one along the second, and so on. Eventually, you can fill your desired space with
a nice uniform hatching, as shown in <a href="#fig14-21">Figure 14-21</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig14-21"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-hatch2.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-21: Calligraphic pen: creating uniform hatching</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The attachment to the guide path is not absolute.
If your mouse pointer strays far enough from the guide path, you’ll be able to tear it off (the track circle will turn from
green to red) and move away—but not quite freely: the pen will maintain some inertia
in the guide-tracking direction. This is intentional; for example, it allows you to continue
drawing a stroke <em>past the end</em> of a guide path, in order to cover a wider area
than the initial guide path would allow. With inertia, this tearing off is usually
pretty smooth, but it is not possible to completely <a id="309"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_309" title="309"/>suppress jerks. If jerking and
unintended tear-offs still bother you, try increasing the <span class="ui">Mass</span> parameter (<a href="#section14.2.4">14.2.4</a>).</p>
			<p>Tracking a guide also allows for some feedback by gradually changing the tracking
distance in response to your drawing behavior. If you're consistently trying to draw
closer or farther from the guide than the current tracking distance, the distance will
decrease or increase a bit, so you will get a hatching that is spaced slightly closer or
wider.</p>
			<p>
				If you've accidentally deselected your last created stroke (for example, by undoing
a bad stroke), you can reselect it without leaving the Calligraphic pen tool by pressing
Shift-Tab (<a href="c05.xhtml#section5.11">5.11</a>).
You can combine guide tracking with adding or subtracting; press
Shift-Ctrl to add the new stroke to the selected guide
path or Alt-Ctrl to subtract from it.</p>
			<p>
				Tracking is designed for smooth engraving patterns, so it will not work on
guide tracks with sharp turns or those that are too uneven (such as calligraphic
strokes with high tremor, <a href="#section14.2.4">14.2.4</a>). Since tracking follows the <em>edge</em> of the stroke, strokes of varying
width (for example, when tracing background, <a href="#section14.2.1.2">14.2.1.2</a>) will result in gradual bending of
the hatching pattern as you proceed.
Finally, you can track only paths; if you have a bitmap that you want to hatch over,
you will have to create the first stroke in each hatching area manually so you can then track
it as a guide (<a href="#fig14-22">Figure 14-22</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig14-22"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-hatch3.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-22: Take 
a bitmap (top), hatch over it with the Calligraphic pen tool, 
and tweak the resulting hatching with the Tweak tool (bottom).</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>It is convenient to use the Tweak tool with guide tracking in the Calligraphic pen. A
hatching rarely comes out perfectly: loose stray ends, the wrong slant or curvature, and
incorrect stroke widths (hatching that’s too dark or light) are the most common
problems. With the Tweak tool, you can fix those problems so you don't have to redo the
hatching. Use the Shrink/Grow mode to clear the loose ends as if with an eraser,
as well as to adjust stroke widths; the Push mode can bend or shape the
hatching. With these powerful tools, using a photo as reference, you can create a complex
and believably shaded hatching.</p>
			<a id="section14.3"/><h2>14.3 The Paint Bucket Tool</h2>
			<p>
				The concept of a "paint bucket" or "flood fill" tool is probably familiar to you from
bitmap editors. In Inkscape, the Paint bucket tool works exactly as you would expect:
click in any area bounded on all sides, and it will fill the area with color. Being a vector
tool, however, Inkscape's Paint bucket creates a new <em>path</em> that fills in
the area where you clicked, as shown in <a href="#fig14-23">Figure 14-23</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig14-23"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-flood.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-23: The Paint bucket filling a bounded area</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="310"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_310" title="310"/>On the other hand, Inkscape's Paint bucket tool is <em>perceptual</em>, not<em>geometric</em>. This means that, when looking for the boundaries around the point you clicked,
it identifies as boundaries any <em>visible</em> color nonuniformities. Filling 
will therefore stop at gradients, blurs, and color boundaries in bitmaps, but it will ignore
any paths or other objects that are fully (or almost) transparent or for whatever
reason do not stand out from the background.</p>
			<p>
				For example, you can scan a pencil sketch, import the bitmap into Inkscape (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.1">18.1</a>), and
quickly "trace" it by filling all of its bounded areas with colors. This convenient and interactive way of digitizing
your paper drawings makes the traditional bitmap tracing (the <span class="ui">Trace Bitmap</span> dialog, <a href="c18.xhtml#section18.5.2">18.5.2</a>)
unnecessary in many cases.</p>
			<p>
				Internally, the tool works by performing a bitmap flood fill on a
screen-resolution rendition of the visible canvas and then tracing the resulting fill
into a vector path. The <em>resolution</em> of the rendition bitmap that the tool uses is
that of your current zoom; the closer you are zoomed in to an area, the higher the
resolution of the flood fill. If the result of the Paint bucket fill is too
imprecise, has rounded corners, or doesn't go into small nooks and crannies where it
is supposed to go—just undo it, zoom in closer (but so that the entire area to fill is
visible), and fill again from the same point. Conversely, if the fill leaks out
through a small gap, zoom out to make the gap less visible and fill again (or adjust the
automatic gap closing parameter, <a href="#section14.3.5">14.3.5</a>).</p>
			<a id="section14.3.1"/><h3>14.3.1 Filling Techniques</h3>
			<p>
				To fill a bounded area, switch to the Paint bucket tool (F7
or U) and click inside the area. If you click with Shift, the
resulting path will be unioned (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.2">12.2</a>) with the selected path; for example, if your first
attempt did not fill in all of the desired area, just Shift-click the
remaining corner to finish it off, as shown in <a href="#fig14-24">Figure 14-24</a>.</p>

					<p>Figure 14-24: Adding a Paint bucket fill to an existing path</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				If you click-and-drag (your drag path is visualized by a red line), you will fill from <em>each of the points</em>
that you passed by dragging. From each point, the fill spreads to its
neighbors with colors similar to that point. In other words, it's like clicking
with this tool at each point of the drag path and combining the results. <a id="311"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_311" title="311"/>This way you
can easily fill an area occupied by a gradient or blur—just drag from the darkest to the
lightest points in the area you want to fill (<a href="#fig14-25">Figure 14-25</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig14-25"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-flood-drag.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-25: With one click, only a narrow strip of a gradient is filled; drag across an area to fill the entire gradient.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Alt-click and drag is similar to simple drag, except from each point
of the drag path, the fill spreads to its neighbors (if any) whose colors are similar to
the color of the <em>initial point</em> (the point where you started the drag), not the
point through which you're dragging. This lets you fill a series of similarly colored
yet separated areas (for example, multiple cells in a cartoon) by starting the drag in
one of those areas and Alt-dragging through all the other areas.</p>
			<a id="section14.3.2"/><h3>14.3.2 Filling by Channel</h3>
			<p>
				When looking for color boundaries to stop at, the Paint bucket tool, by default, looks at the
same colors that you see on the canvas. However, you can restrict its vision to a
specific color channel.  The <span class="ui">Fill by</span> drop-down menu, apart from the default<span class="ui">Visible Colors</span>, allows you to choose any of the three RGB channels (<span class="ui">Red</span>, <span class="ui">Green</span>,<span class="ui">Blue</span>), any of the HSL channels (<span class="ui">Hue</span>, <span class="ui">Saturation</span>, <span class="ui">Lightness</span>), or the <span class="ui">Alpha</span> channel
(opacity).</p>
			<p>
				For example, if you select the <span class="ui">Red</span> channel, even the sharpest green/blue color
boundaries won't stop the fill. Choosing the <span class="ui">Alpha</span> channel makes the tool ignore any
colors and look only at where opacity changes; for example, if you have a complex,
multicolored, but fully opaque object over a transparent background, clicking this
object in <span class="ui">Alpha</span> mode will fill up to the outline of the entire object.</p>
			<a id="section14.3.3"/><h3>14.3.3 Threshold</h3>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Threshold</span> parameter, with a range from 0 to 100, controls how different
a point's color must be, compared to the initial click point, to stop the propagation of
the fill. Zero tolerance means only the area of strictly the same color will be filled;
the larger the tolerance, the larger the filled area will be, and the easier it will be
for the fill to leak away into adjacent color areas. The default value is 5.</p>
			<a id="section14.3.4"/><h3>14.3.4 Growing and Shrinking</h3>
			<p>
				With the <span class="ui">Grow/shrink by</span> parameter, you can control the amount of inset or
outset to be applied to the created fill path. This works much the same as the<span class="ui">Outset</span> and <span class="ui">Inset</span> path commands (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.4">12.4</a>), except it's
done automatically after every fill.</p>
			<p>
				A positive <span class="ui">Grow/shrink</span> value causes the fill path to be larger than
the filled bitmap area it represents; this is often useful for eliminating anti-aliasing
gaps between the fill and its boundary. A negative value makes the path smaller,
ensuring a constant-width gap between the fill and the boundary.</p>
			<a id="section14.3.5"/><h3>
				14.3.5 <a id="312"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_312" title="312"/>Closing Gaps</h3>
			<p>
				With the <span class="ui">Close gaps</span> parameter, you can make the Paint bucket tool ignore any
gaps in the area boundaries that would normally cause the fill to spill out of the
desired area. There are four levels of automatic gap closing:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="ui">None</span></li>
				<li><span class="ui">Small</span> (gaps up to 2 screen pixels in size are closed)</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Medium</span> (gaps up to 4 screen pixels in size are closed)</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Large</span> (gaps up to 6 screen pixels in size are closed)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Setting this parameter to anything other than <span class="ui">None</span> makes the tool
noticeably slower, especially when filling large areas.</p>
			<a id="section14.3.6"/><h3>14.3.6 Style</h3>
			<p>
				Like all object-creating tools, the Paint bucket can use the last set style (<a href="c11.xhtml#section11.1.2">11.1.2</a>)
for the objects it creates (this is the default), or it can use its own fixed style. You
can switch between these modes in the tool's <span class="ui">Preferences</span> page (double-click
the tool icon to access it). As with other tools, the style swatch on the far right
of the controls bar shows the style that will be used for the next fill. To change
the last set color without affecting any object, just deselect all
(Escape) and click a color on the palette.</p>
			<p>Ctrl-click in the Paint bucket tool is special. With Ctrl, the tool does not
fill an area, but performs instant styling of an existing object on which you clicked (without selecting it):
it simply changes that object's fill color to the current fill color of the tool. Similarly, 
Shift-Ctrl-clicking changes the stroke to the current stroke color of the tool
(if no stroke is set, then Shift-Ctrl-clicking behaves like Ctrl-clicking).
For example, you can use this to recolor some of the fill objects you created previously, without needing
to select them first and without leaving the Paint bucket tool.</p>
			<a id="section14.4"/><h2>14.4 Eraser Tool</h2>
			<p>
				As the name suggests, this tool is for quickly and conveniently erasing stuff. Inkscape's Eraser tool (Shift-E) implements three different modes,
represented by the three toggle buttons on the controls bar (<a href="#fig14-26">Figure 14-26</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig14-26"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-eraser.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-26: The Eraser tool</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<dl>
				<dt>Delete mode</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						In this mode, you drag across objects (leaving a red trace), and after you release, the tool
deletes those objects touched by your drag path (compare <a href="c05.xhtml#section5.8">5.8</a>). This mode has no further options.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><a id="313"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_313" title="313"/>Cut mode
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						In this mode, Eraser draws a path, just as the Calligraphic pen does, and then uses the <span class="ui">Difference</span> Boolean
operation (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.2">12.2</a>) to subtract it from the other paths or shapes that happen to be underneath.
The options in this mode are analogous to those of the Calligraphic pen, including <span class="ui">Width</span> (<a href="#section14.2.1">14.2.1</a>),<span class="ui">Thinning</span> (<a href="#section14.2.1.3">14.2.1.3</a>), <span class="ui">Caps</span> (<a href="#section14.2.3">14.2.3</a>), and even<span class="ui">Tremor</span> and <span class="ui">Mass</span> (<a href="#section14.2.4">14.2.4</a>). The last toggle button forces the tool to break apart (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.1.1">12.1.1</a>) each path
that was cut into disjointed parts.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Clip mode</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						This mode works like the Cut mode, but instead of subtracting, the tool clips (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.3">18.3</a>) the objects you draw over.
This is a better approach because, first, the clipping operation is nondestructive (you can always recover the original object using<span class="ui">Object<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Clip<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Release</span>), and second, clipping works not only for paths but also for other objects such as bitmaps. 
An object in SVG can have only a single clipping path, but the tool is smart enough to work as expected when you clip
an already clipped object: it adds the new path to clip already in effect.</p>

				14.5 <a id="314"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_314" title="314"/>Connector Tool</h2>
			<p>Diagramming applications, of which the best known is Microsoft Visio, are a popular class of software with a lot of
overlap with vector graphics. Inkscape's Connector tool extends its functionality in this area—certainly
not enough to make it a Visio replacement but sufficient for small diagramming projects.</p>
			<p>Basically, a diagram is a vector drawing
that has objects connected by different kinds of lines—to illustrate
workflow sequences, links, calls, classifications, or other types of relationships. Crucially, the program
is aware of what is connected to what and updates the connector lines whenever you move around the connected objects. That's
exactly what the Connector tool does.</p>
			<p>
				To try it out, draw a few rectangles in the Rectangle tool. You can also create text labels and group each label with its rectangle. 
Then switch to the Connector tool (O). You will see, as you hover your mouse over one of these objects, a white square handle
in the center. Grab it, drag toward another rectangle, and drop it onto the other rectangle's central handle. That creates a straight connector line
that goes between the edges of the rectangles, along the line connecting their centers (<a href="#fig14-27">Figure 14-27</a>). Now move the rectangles around (in Selector), and you will
see the connector updating live.</p>
			<a id="fig14-27"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-diagram.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-27: The Connector tool</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The connectors are regular SVG paths that you can style as you wish—for example, by assigning arrowhead markers (<a href="c09.xhtml#section9.5">9.5</a>) to them.
You can also node-edit them as paths, but you really shouldn't. As soon as one of the connected objects moves, its connectors are automatically updated,
discarding any node edits you have done to them.</p>
			<p>
				As you move objects around, you will naturally want to avoid situations where connector lines cross the connected (or any other) objects. The Connector tool
can do that for yOu, too. The first two buttons on the tool's controls bar will enable and disable the <em>avoid property</em> for the currently selected objects. If an
object has this property, connector lines will be routed in such a way as to avoid crossing or touching it. If you select all the blocks of your diagram
and enable this property for all of them with one click, you will have much more freedom in moving stuff around without making the diagram unreadable.
You can adjust the gaps between the objects and the connectors with the <span class="ui">Spacing</span> parameter (<a href="#fig14-28">Figure 14-28</a>).</p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="315"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_315" title="315"/>The Connector tool can also produce another style of connectors: <em>orthogonal</em>, consisting of vertical and horizontal segments, optionally with
rounded corners, as shown in <a href="#fig14-29">Figure 14-29</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig14-29"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="15/dr-diagram-orthogonal.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 14-29: The Connector tool: orthogonal connectors</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>You can change the curvature radius individually for each connecter (click it in the Connector tool to select). This option
can be combined with the avoid property for the diagram blocks.</p>

					<h2>Path Connectors in SVG</h2>
					<p>
						Diagram connectors do not use path effects (<a href="c13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a>), but they implement a similar approach: the visible path
is automatically calculated by Inkscape from higher-level metadata stored in the connector's <code>svg:path</code> element. This metadata
includes the start and end objects that the connector is attached to, the type of connector, and its curvature.</p>

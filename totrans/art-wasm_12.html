<p class="BodyFirst">Thank you for reading my book! I hope by now you understand how WebAssembly works at a low level and are ready to begin using it for high-level and low-level web development. WebAssembly is a young technology, but itâ€™s already available in every major browser. Using Node.js, you can also develop high-performance server code as WebAssembly modules. More languages for developing WebAssembly applications become available all the time. New features and platforms are being added. The future is a world where the web is safe, secure, and fast with WebAssembly.</p>

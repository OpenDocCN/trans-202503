- en: A robot’s muscles are almost always its motors. Put simply, a *motor* is an
    electromechanical device that rotates a shaft when an electric current is applied
    to it. There are many kinds of motors, but the particular type of motor normally
    used for robotics is the DC (direct current) motor.

    forces cause DC motors to spin. When power is applied to the motor’s terminals,
    the motor shaft spins in one direction.

    the magnetic fields created inside the motor are also reversed.

    One pair is located between each motor terminal and the voltage source, and one
    pair is located between each motor terminal and ground. When you draw this out
    on paper, you’ll notice it looks a bit like an *H*, which is how this circuit
    got its name.

    in such a way that it spins clockwise. When the other set, labeled “B,” is closed,
    power flows in the opposite direction, and the motor spins counterclockwise.

    with a single double-pole double-throw (DPDT) switch. With a DPDT switch, you
    can create the most basic H-bridge circuit imaginable.

    speed. Although there are many ways to control motor speed, the easiest method
    is to change the amount of voltage you are applying. The more voltage you apply
    to a motor, the faster it spins.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, if you apply too much voltage, the coils inside the motor will overheat,
    the protective coating on the coils will melt, the wires will short, and the motor
    will stop working. Therefore, it is important to know what the maximum voltage
    rating is for a motor so that you don’t overheat it and release the “magic smoke.”

- en: If you don’t know what the operating voltage is, you can guess using the very
    scientific method of trial and error. Start with a small voltage supply of 3 V
    and gradually increase the amount of electricity. If either the motor or batteries
    get so hot that you can’t touch them, you’re giving the motor too much voltage.
    Let things cool down and use the previous power supply that you tested before
    it began to heat up.

    to send the servo a signal that tells it to rotate to a certain position, usually
    some value between 0º and 180º. In fact, there is even a physical stop inside
    the gearbox that prevents the drive shaft from making a complete rotation.

    They cannot be told to travel to a particular degree around the circle. Instead
    of controlling the servo’s specific position, the microcontroller is used to send
    a signal that controls the speed at which the servo rotates. Since a continuous-rotation
    servo does not have a physical stop in the gearbox, it’s the best type of servo
    for you to remove the controller board and modify to run directly off a battery

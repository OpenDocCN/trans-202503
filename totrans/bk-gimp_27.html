It can read 35 input formats and generate 39 output formats. Moreover, it accepts these formats in a compressed form, using either the Gzip or Bzip2 compression techniques.</p><p>If we covered all these formats in detail, this chapter would be enormous. Instead, we cover only the formats that are popular with, or at least useful to, many GIMP users. We also discuss the general principles that govern the various image formats.</p></div>

This holds true on all current displays: cathode-ray tube, plasma, liquid crystals, and others. This is also true for laser and inkjet printers. Even the eye breaks down images into an array of rods and cones, as described in <a class="xref" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. Vision and Image Representation">Appendix A</a>.</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>file format</em></span> is how a file is stored in memory and is independent of how an image was captured and how it will eventually be viewed. So the representation of an image as a file, whether stored on disk or downloaded online, is not necessarily a representation of the final matrix of pixels. And because pixel density varies widely among mobile phone displays, computer monitors, cheap inkjet printers, and professional laser printers, any representation needs to be converted from the internal representation to the external one. Images that you produce must also be converted—be it from a phone’s camera, a scanner, or a professional digital camera.</p><div class="sect2" title="Raster and Vector Formats"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="raster_and_vector_formats"/>Raster and Vector Formats</h2></div></div></div><p>Image formats can be divided into two main families: raster and vector.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>In the <span class="emphasis"><em>raster formats</em></span>, an image is stored as a representation of the pixels it contains.

Although tools are available for converting an image from a raster format to a vector image, the results tend to be poor.</p><p>GIMP works on the raster representation of images, so it works well for photographs and illustrations. A pixmap cannot be zoomed in indefinitely, however, so when working with a raster image, work with as large a definition as possible. You can always reduce the size before sending the file to somebody or posting it online.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Lossless and Lossy Compression"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="lossless_and_lossy_compression"/>Lossless and Lossy Compression</h2></div></div></div><p>Raster images are generally large, and they keep getting larger as digital cameras improve. The data size of a single pixel also increases when the number of colors that can be represented increases. And the number of pixels increases with the size and resolution of the image. A digital camera can now create images as large as 10 (or even 12) million pixels, which generally means at least 30MB if the number of colors in each channel is 256.</p><p>A 30MB file is rather large, even for current hard disks, especially if you store a lot of photos. This file size is also large for most memory <a id="iddle1886" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1897" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3734" class="indexterm"/>cards and would be difficult to send via email or to post online. One solution is to compress the file to decrease its size. A number of algorithms are available for compressing files, especially image files. These algorithms can be either lossless or lossy.</p><div class="figure"><a id="photo_of_a_rose_with_decreasing_image_qu"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id01629"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1457296.png.jpg" alt="A photo of a rose with decreasing image quality"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 20-5. A photo of a rose with decreasing image quality</p></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>lossless</em></span> compression algorithm rebuilds the original data without losing any information.

Unfortunately, not all image formats are supported by all browsers. In fact, the three common formats discussed in the next section are the only ones that are displayed by all existing browsers, and sometimes even those formats don’t work perfectly.</p><p>Many different browsers exist, and some browsers vary depending on your operating system. Browsers use <span class="emphasis"><em>layout engines</em></span> to display images on the screen. Fewer than 10 layout engines are available, and only a handful are widely used. Different browsers using the same layout engine handle images in the same way. The following table lists popular layout engines and the browsers that use them:</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>Layout Engine</p></th><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>Browsers</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>Gecko</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>all Mozilla software: Firefox, Galeon, Seamonkey, etc.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>KHTML</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>Konqueror</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>Presto</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>Opera</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>Trident</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>Internet Explorer 4 to 9</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>Webkit</p></td><td style="" valign="top"><p>Safari, Epiphany, Google Chrome</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Because many people still use Internet Explorer, many people use Trident.

This committee defined what became an ISO standard in 1994. The format they designed is the usual output format of most, if not all, digital cameras. JFIF stands for <span class="emphasis"><em>JPEG File Interchange Format</em></span>.</p><p>JPEG uses a lossy compression algorithm, which means that some information is lost, but the file size is decreased substantially while maintaining a fairly high image quality. JPEG is the format of choice for photographs and digital illustrations because it can present complex images as files that are small enough to send by email or to post on the Web.</p><p>As shown in <a class="xref" href="ch20s01.html#initial_photo_of_the_rose_left_parenthes" title="Figure 20-7. The initial photo of the rose (left); the same image after saving and reloading several times (right)">Figure 20-7</a>, exporting a JPEG over and over is not a good idea because the quality loss accumulates. Each time you load a picture you start with the last state, which suffered some loss of quality when you last exported it. Always work on the image as an XCF in GIMP, and export it from the XCF to store it as a JPEG. This issue is one of the reasons why, since version 2.8, GIMP only exports an image as JPEG and doesn’t consider the image to be saved until you have saved it as an XCF file.</p><p>The JPEG format is not well suited to images containing line drawings, text, or a sharp contrast between adjacent pixels. A lossless compression algorithm is needed in such a case, because it means that only some pixels from the initial image are saved and the missing pixels are interpolated when the image is loaded. If pixels along a sharp border in a line drawing are not saved, the interpolation assigns them an average value based on the surrounding pixels, which smooths the border and can make the image look blurry.</p><div class="figure"><a id="sharp_contrast_with_a_lossy_compression"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id01632"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1457302.png.jpg" alt="Sharp contrast with a lossy compression algorithm"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 20-8. Sharp contrast with a lossy compression algorithm</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="sharp_contrast_with_a_lossless_compressi"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id01633"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1457304.png.jpg" alt="Sharp contrast with a lossless compression algorithm"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 20-9. Sharp contrast with a lossless compression algorithm</p></div><p><a class="xref" href="ch20s02.html#sharp_contrast_with_a_lossy_compression" title="Figure 20-8. Sharp contrast with a lossy compression algorithm">Figure 20-8</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch20s02.html#sharp_contrast_with_a_lossless_compressi" title="Figure 20-9. Sharp contrast with a lossless compression algorithm">Figure 20-9</a> show the difference between a lossy and lossless compression algorithm used on an image with high contrast. In the first figure, the character contours are blurred by the lossy compression algorithm, <a id="iddle1135" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1801" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1843" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1887" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2098" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2339" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2344" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2989" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3286" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3474" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4794" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle5303" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle5994" class="indexterm"/>whereas in the second figure, they remain sharp, thanks to the lossless compression algorithm.</p><p>Another weakness of the JPEG format is that it cannot handle transparency. Although generally fine for photos, if you want to display a non-rectangular graphic on a web page, for example, and it’s a JPEG, you have to fill the background with a color or pattern.</p><p>A JPEG file can contain an ICC color profile, which defines the color space used (see <a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Color">Chapter 12</a>). If this is the case, when you load the file, GIMP asks whether you want to use the embedded profile. Generally, you should answer yes. Many simpler image applications simply ignore the profile.</p><div class="sect3" title="Exporting to JPEG"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="exporting_to_jpeg"/>Exporting to JPEG</h3></div></div></div><p>When you export an image to JPEG (<code class="literal">.jpeg</code> or <code class="literal">.jpg</code>), GIMP opens a dialog, which in its simplest form only allows you to set the compression quality [0 to 100].</p><p>The Q<span class="smaller">UALITY</span> slider determines how much the image quality will be degraded to decrease the file size. Images at values greater than 85 generally look the same, and the loss in quality is practically indiscernible at such values.

Although this format has many major drawbacks, it remains popular partly because it’s the simplest format for building small animations (<a class="xref" href="ch18.html" title="Chapter 18. Animation Tools">Chapter 18</a>) and because people are familiar with it.</p><p>This format was defined in 1987 by CompuServe, now a subsidiary of AOL. At that time, the compression of images was considered much more important than the number of colors, which was limited by most existing display <a id="iddle3403" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4312" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4333" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4377" class="indexterm"/>screens. For this reason, the GIF format, with its efficient compression algorithm and limited palette, was widely used in the first browsers and graphic tools.</p><div class="figure"><a id="export_image_as_jpeg_dialog-id00198"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id01634"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1457306.png.jpg" alt="The Export Image as JPEG dialog"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 20-10. The Export Image as JPEG dialog</p></div><p>The compression algorithm used by GIF is known as LZW. It was designed in the late 1970s by Jacob Ziv and Abraham Lempel and improved in 1983 by Terry Welch. Welch immediately filed an application for a US patent on his algorithm and extended this patent later to various other countries.</p><p>When the GIF format was published, the authors were not aware of the patent, and it was only in 1993 that the current patent owner, Unisys, tried to exercise rights to the algorithm. They tried to get royalties when the format was used, at least in commercial products. This triggered much indignation in the Internet world and was one of the main reasons for the development of the PNG format (see <a class="xref" href="ch20s02.html#png-id00199" title="PNG">PNG</a>). The patent expired in 2003 in the US and one year later in other countries, so you can now use the format freely, but its reputation hasn’t fully recovered.</p><p>The GIF format was actually pretty good when it was developed, but today PNG is superior in all respects but one: animation. Internet Explorer’s poor support of PNG remains a major obstacle to the full adoption of this format, however.</p><p>GIF’s main characteristic is that the image must be in <span class="emphasis"><em>indexed mode</em></span>. An indexed image is encoded using a color table, as we explained in <a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Color">Chapter 12</a>. The pixels are represented as indexes in the table, and the size of each pixel depends on the size of the table: A table with 4 colors requires 2 bits, a table with 64 colors requires 6 bits, and a table with 256 colors requires 8 bits (1 byte), the maximum for GIF.</p><p>Indexed mode saves space because a pixel needs at most 1 byte instead of 3 (with 8-bit depth RGB encoding). But even more space is saved by the increased probability that neighboring pixels are the same. Instead of storing the value of every pixel separately, a compression algorithm can store the shape and size of a contiguous area with identical pixels and the pixel value for the area.</p><div class="figure"><a id="rose_in_figure_20dot7_indexed_with_32_co"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id01635"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1457308.png.jpg" alt="The rose in indexed with 32 colors"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 20-11. The rose in <a class="xref" href="ch20s01.html#initial_photo_of_the_rose_left_parenthes" title="Figure 20-7. The initial photo of the rose (left); the same image after saving and reloading several times (right)">Figure 20-7</a> indexed with 32 colors</p></div><p><a id="iddle1136" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1753" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2142" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2342" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2360" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2999" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3332" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3487" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3712" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4318" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4667" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4685" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4792" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle5995" class="indexterm"/>The LZW compression algorithm doesn’t quite work that way, but the compression rate is still better if neighboring pixels have the same value. LZW doesn’t work if there are more possible values for pixels than pixels in the image, which is often the case with RGB encoding. With 8-bit RGB, you have 2<sup>24</sup> possible pixel values (more than 16 million), but a 4000 × 4000 pixel image is unusually large. GIF also doesn’t work well for photos, as the probability that neighboring pixels have the same value is low.</p><p>The LZW algorithm works best when the image contains large areas of the same color, which means the GIF format is best suited for simple graphics, line drawings, and cartoons. A smooth change in hue or value is not easy to represent because the palette does not have enough colors. A technique known as <span class="emphasis"><em>dithering</em></span> can smooth transitions to a degree. When dithering is applied, two different colors are used in neighboring pixels, and because the pixels are so small, the eye blends the two colors together. Dithering can lead to a loss of detail, and the result doesn’t always look very good. Another consequence is that neighboring pixels are no longer identical, so the LZW algorithm can’t compress the image as effectively.</p><p><a class="xref" href="ch20s02.html#rose_in_figure_20dot7_indexed_with_32_co" title="Figure 20-11. The rose in Figure 20-7 indexed with 32 colors">Figure 20-11</a> shows the effect of indexing on the rose from <a class="xref" href="ch20s01.html#initial_photo_of_the_rose_left_parenthes" title="Figure 20-7. The initial photo of the rose (left); the same image after saving and reloading several times (right)">Figure 20-7</a>.

It might also have layer masks, channels containing saved selections, and paths. It probably also includes undo history. Anything you can do in GIMP can be represented by the <span class="emphasis"><em>native format</em></span>, XCF. A native format is a file structure designed specifically for a piece of software.</p><p>GIMP also has tools for defining new brushes, patterns, palettes, and gradients. Each of those also has a native format in GIMP. You can download custom brushes, patterns, palettes, and gradients from the Web or even create your own and post them for other users to download. We show you how in <a class="xref" href="ch22.html" title="Chapter 22. Customizing GIMP">Chapter 22</a>.</p><div class="sect2" title="XCF"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="xcf"/>XCF</h2></div></div></div><p>XCF is GIMP’s most important native format. When you save an image in XCF, you’re saving all its components, layers, layer groups, masks, <a id="iddle1552" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1888" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1894" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2682" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3055" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3086" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3096" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3188" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3887" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4160" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4214" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4222" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4419" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle5892" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle6034" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle6076" class="indexterm"/>channels, paths, guides, and so on. The only thing that isn’t saved is the undo history, which would increase the file size significantly.</p><p>XCF is the only format that is guaranteed to store all the information in an image that you’re working on in GIMP, and it’s the best format for a work in progress. If you want to store a file in another format, but you want to make additional changes at some point, always save a copy of your work as XCF.</p><p>Because XCF stores so much information, an XCF file can be rather large, but GIMP allows you to compress it using one of two lossless external compression algorithms: the one used by Gzip and the one used by Bzip2. Bzip2 yields better results than Gzip but only by 30% or 40% at most. Bzip2 is also much slower. GIMP can load and save files compressed using these algorithms without first having to unpack the files. The compression is indicated by a second extension, which is either <code class="literal">.gz</code> or <code class="literal">.bz2</code>. On a GNU/Linux operating system, the suffix does not determinate the file format, which is specified by the file’s first few bytes, but it can be helpful for users.</p><p>Although XCF can be read by several other applications, including ImageMagick, Krita, and Inkscape, it’s not intended as a universal format.</p><p>When you save an image with <span class="strong"><strong>Image: File &gt; Save As</strong></span> or <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00550"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1453852.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>, GIMP automatically assumes the file format is XCF and adds the corresponding extension to the filename. For all other output formats, you must export the image with <span class="strong"><strong>Image: File &gt; Export As</strong></span> or <span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00551"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1453856.png.jpg" alt=""/></span>. The export commands cannot generate XCF. If an image is modified and then exported, GIMP does not consider the image saved and opens a warning window if you try to close it.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Other Native Formats"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="other_native_formats"/>Other Native Formats</h2></div></div></div><p>In addition to images, whose natural format is XCF, four other objects have their own native formats in GIMP. These are brushes, patterns, gradients, and palettes. Each of these objects has a specialized dockable dialog: The Brushes dialog, the Patterns dialog, and the Gradients dialog are present, by default, in the multi-dialog window; and the Palettes dialog can be opened via <span class="strong"><strong>Image: Windows &gt; Dockable dialogs</strong></span> or from the dialog menu, which you open by clicking the small triangle found at the top of all dockable dialogs.</p><p>These objects are stored on the computer in special folders, which you can define using <span class="strong"><strong>Image: Edit &gt; Preferences</strong></span> in the Folders entry. Each category has a systemwide folder, where objects are stored when installing or updating GIMP, and a personal folder, where you can store objects you create.</p><p>You can create, edit, or delete a brush, pattern, and palette by using the buttons at the bottom of the corresponding dialog. These let you do the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Edit the current object. Editing works only if the object is in the personal folder. Otherwise, you can only look at the characteristics of the object.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Create a new object.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Duplicate the current object.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Delete the current object (if it’s in your personal folder).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Refresh the object list in the dialog.</p></li></ul></div><p>You can also access these options via the dialog menu or by right-clicking a brush, palette, or pattern. Patterns are not built using a specific tool, so the Patterns dialog only contains buttons for deleting, refreshing, and opening the current pattern as an image.</p><p>Building and saving new brushes, patterns, dialogs, and palettes is described in <a class="xref" href="ch22.html" title="Chapter 22. Customizing GIMP">Chapter 22</a>.</p></div></div>

Early laser printers, and even many current ones, use PostScript to describe pages being printed. These printers contain an interpreter for the language, and executing this interpreter tells the printer where to put dots on the page.</p><p>PostScript is a proprietary language that belongs to Adobe, but its description is public. The Ghostscript interpreter is free software under GPL that lets you print PostScript files on printers that don’t use PostScript (for instance, on most inkjet printers).</p><p>PostScript is a vector graphics language. It rasterizes the image at the last moment when the printer definition is received from the printer. The character fonts can be defined in vector geometry and zoomed in or out without pixelation.</p><p>When you export an image as PostScript (<code class="literal">.ps</code>), GIMP opens the dialog shown in <a class="xref" href="ch20s04.html#export_image_as_postscript_dialog" title="Figure 20-18. The Export Image as PostScript dialog">Figure 20-18</a>. The dimensions of the image are predefined in millimeters or inches. You can change them, but if you do, you freeze the printer definition attached to the image. Leaving the conversion from image to PostScript to whatever application you use to add it to a document is best.</p><p>Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) is PostScript with additional information on the box that encapsulates the image. This information tells the application importing the file the image’s exact dimensions and generally works more smoothly than regular PostScript when inserting an image into a document.</p><p>GIMP can also import a PostScript file using the dialog in <a class="xref" href="ch20s04.html#import_from_postscript_dialog" title="Figure 20-19. The Import from PostScript dialog">Figure 20-19</a>. The resolution you choose is very important. The image is immediately rasterized when you import it, and the vector information in the input file is lost.</p><p>The Portable Document Format, generally known as PDF, is a simplified version of PostScript. PDF also belongs to Adobe but was accepted as an ISO standard in 2008. PDF is slowly replacing PostScript and offers several advantages.

These programs handle a large set of graphic formats and define four new ones that are supported by GIMP:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Portable Bit Map (PBM) is for bitmaps (black and white images).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a id="iddle1101" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1269" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1431" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1890" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2357" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2914" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3115" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4344" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4408" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle4527" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle5150" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle5237" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle5954" class="indexterm"/>Portable Gray Map (PGM) is for grayscale images.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Portable Pixmap (PPM) is for color pixmaps.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>PNM refers to these three formats together.</p></li></ul></div><p>Netpbm offers an additional format called PAM, but GIMP doesn’t support it. All these formats use a textual representation, which results in very large files. For example, the rose in <a class="xref" href="ch20s01.html#photo_of_a_rose_with_decreasing_image_qu" title="Figure 20-5. A photo of a rose with decreasing image quality">Figure 20-5</a> has the following sizes (the TIFF was saved with Deflate compression):</p><div class="informaltable"><table style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; border-left: 0.5pt solid ; border-right: 0.5pt solid ; "><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>Format</p></th><th style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>Size (KB)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>GIF</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>109</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>JPEG</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>26</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>TIFF</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>300</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 0.5pt solid ; " valign="top"><p>PPM</p></td><td style="" valign="top"><p>3600</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Despite their size, these formats are handy because you can convert them to or from almost any existing image format.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="SVG"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="svg"/>SVG</h2></div></div></div><p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is the format of choice for vector graphics. It is an open standard defined by the World Wide Web Consortium that relies on the textual nature of XML. More and more application programs accept this format in their input files, including GIMP.</p><p>SVG is the native format for some vector graphics programs like Inkscape (free software). Others, like Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, Blender, or Xara Xtreme (the last two are free software), can import and export SVG files. Note that Adobe Photoshop does not offer SVG support.</p><p>Most browsers can display SVG images. The only exception is Internet Explorer, but plug-ins are available that allow Internet Explorer to display SVG.</p><p>GIMP can import SVG images like the one shown in <a class="xref" href="ch20s01.html#icon_enlarged_as_a_vector_image" title="Figure 20-2. The icon enlarged as a vector image">Figure 20-2</a>, but exporting a raster image to SVG is not possible, and the result probably wouldn’t look very good anyway. But a GIMP path can be exported to SVG.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Additional Formats Supported by GIMP"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="additional_formats_supported_by_gimp"/>Additional Formats Supported by GIMP</h2></div></div></div><p>GIMP can import Photoshop image files, which is useful for people who want to abandon proprietary software in favor of free software.</p><p>The BMP format is a very simple Microsoft format that lacks compression. The image in <a class="xref" href="ch20s01.html#photo_of_a_rose_with_decreasing_image_qu" title="Figure 20-5. A photo of a rose with decreasing image quality">Figure 20-5</a> takes up 1100KB when saved in BMP. This format is notably used for icons in the Microsoft Windows system as well as in OS/2. GIMP can import and export BMP files. When exporting, you can choose the number of bits of the color space and the representation of the Alpha channel, if one exists.</p><p>The X window system (the windowing system on all Unix-like operating systems) uses the XPM and XBM graphic formats for icons and such. The first one is for pixmaps and the second one for bitmaps. Both are fully textual, so they aren’t suitable for large images. The image shown in <a class="xref" href="ch20s01.html#photo_of_a_rose_with_decreasing_image_qu" title="Figure 20-5. A photo of a rose with decreasing image quality">Figure 20-5</a> occupies 2400KB when exported to XPM.</p><p>An image format popular among professional photographers is <span class="emphasis"><em>raw format</em></span>. We discuss this format in more detail in <a class="xref" href="ch19s03.html#choosing_a_format" title="Choosing a Format">Choosing a Format</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch19s03.html#handling_raw_photographs" title="Handling Raw Photographs">Handling Raw Photographs</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>

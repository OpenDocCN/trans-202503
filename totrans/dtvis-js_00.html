Data is critical to the largest social organizations in human history (giants like Facebook and Google), and its collection has widespread geopolitical implications, as we all saw with the NSA surveillance scandal. But it’s also getting easier to ignore the data itself. One estimate suggests that 99.5% of the data our systems collect goes to waste.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Data visualization</em></span> is a tool that addresses this gap. Effective visualizations clarify; they transform abstract collections of numbers into shapes and forms that viewers quickly grasp and understand. The best visualizations impart this understanding intuitively. Viewers comprehend the data immediately—without thinking. This frees viewers to more fully consider the implications of the data: the stories it tells, the insights it reveals, or even the warnings it offers.</p><p>If you’re developing websites or web applications today, there’s a good chance you have data to communicate—data best presented in a good visualization. But how do you know what kind of visualization is appropriate? And even more importantly, how do you actually create one? In the chapters that follow, we explore dozens of different visualizations, techniques, and toolkits. Each example discusses the appropriateness of the visualization (and suggests possible alternatives) and provides step-by-step instructions for adding the visualization to your web pages.</p><div class="sect1" title="The Book’s Philosophy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="bookapostrophes_philosophy">The Book’s Philosophy</h2></div></div></div><p>In creating this book, I’ve tried to follow four main principles to make sure it provides meaningful and practical guidance.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Implementation vs. Design</strong></span></p><p>This book won’t teach you how to design data visualizations. Quite honestly, there are other authors far better qualified than me for that (Edward Tufte, for example). Instead, this book will focus on implementing visualizations. When appropriate, I’ll take a slightly bigger picture view to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of particular visualization strategies, but the main goal is to show you how to create a wide range of visualizations. (I recognize that sometimes the boss absolutely insists on a pie chart.)</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Code vs. Styling</strong></span></p><p>As you might guess from the title, this book focuses on how to use JavaScript code to create visualizations. The examples don’t assume you’re a JavaScript expert—and I’ll be sure to explain any code more complicated than a basic jQuery selector—but I won’t spend much time discussing styles for the visualizations. Fortunately, styling visualizations is pretty much the same as styling other web content. Basic experience with HTML and CSS will serve you well when you add visualizations to your pages.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Simple vs. Complex</strong></span></p><p>Most of the book’s examples are simple, straightforward visualizations. Complex visualizations can be engaging and compelling, but studying a lot of advanced code usually isn’t the best way to learn the craft. In these examples, I’ll try to stay as simple as possible so you can clearly see how to use the various tools and techniques. Simple doesn’t mean boring, however, and even the simplest visualizations can be enlightening and inspiring.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Reality vs. an Ideal World</strong></span></p><p>When you begin building your own visualizations, you’ll discover that the real world is rarely as kind as you’d wish. Open source libraries have bugs, third-party servers have security issues, and not every user has updated to the latest and greatest web browser. I’ve addressed these realities in the examples in this book. I’ll show you how to accommodate older browsers when it’s practical, how to comply with security constraints such as Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), and how to work around bugs in other folks’ code.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect1" title="The Book’s Contents"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="bookapostrophes_contents">The Book’s Contents</h2></div></div></div><p>The chapters that follow cover a variety of visualization techniques and the JavaScript libraries that we can use to implement them.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Graphing Data">Chapter 1</a></strong></span> begins with the most basic visualizations—static charts and plots—using the Flotr2 library.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Making Charts Interactive">Chapter 2</a></strong></span> adds interactivity to the visualizations, giving users the chance to select content, zoom in, and track values. The chapter also shows how to retrieve data for visualizations directly from the Web. For variety, its examples use the Flot library, which is based on jQuery.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Integrating Charts on a Page">Chapter 3</a></strong></span> looks at integrating multiple visualizations and with other content on a web page; it uses the jQuery sparklines library.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Creating Specialized Graphs">Chapter 4</a></strong></span>, we consider visualizations other than standard charts and plots, including tree maps, heat maps, network graphs, and word clouds.

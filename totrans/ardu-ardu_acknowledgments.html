<p class="TNI">As always, a huge thank-you to the Arduino team: Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, David Mellis, and all those who maintain and update the Arduino ecosystem. Without your vision, thought, and hard work, none of this would have been possible. Once again, kudos and thanks to the KiCad team for their open source electronics design automation suite, which I’ve used throughout this book for circuit schematics.</p>
<p class="TX">Many thanks to my technical reviewer, Xander Soldaat, for his contributions and for once again having the tenacity to follow through with such a large project.</p>
<p class="TX">Thanks also to the following people (in no particular order) from whom I’ve received encouragement, inspiration, and support: Elizabeth Pryce, Mr. Richard Smith AC, the late Sir Clive Sinclair, and my wife, Kathleen, for her endless patience and missing husband.</p>
<p class="TX">Finally, thank you to everyone at No Starch Press for their efforts, including Abigail Schott-Rosenfield for their editorial input; Sydney Cromwell for guiding the book through the production process; Kim Wimpsett for copyediting; Elizabeth Littrell for proofreading; and of course, Bill Pollock for his continuing support for authors who want to help people get into hardware and software design.</p>

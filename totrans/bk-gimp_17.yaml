    in [Figure 10-1](ch10s01.html#rulers_measuring_in_pixels "Figure 10-1. Rulers
    measuring in pixels"). The horizontal ruler is just below the menu bar, and the
    vertical ruler is on the left side. In this figure, the mouse pointer is located
    at coordinates (1356, 1128), as the information on the left of the status bar
    shows. The coordinate units, displayed just to the right of these numbers, are
    pixels. Because the image zoom factor is 25%, as shown in the status bar, a pixel
    on the screen actually corresponds to a square of 4 × 4 pixels. Small black triangles
    on each of the rulers show the mouse pointer’s current horizontal and vertical
    coordinates.

    provided allows you to place the mouse pointer with some precision, especially
    if you set the zoom factor to 100% or more, as you’ll see later in this chapter.

    the numbers on the rulers, and at the bottom left, have changed. We changed the
    units from pixels to millimeters. But what do these millimeters really represent?
    Because the zoom factor is 25%, these millimeters don’t equate to millimeters
    in the image but rather to quarters of millimeters. If we change the zoom factor
    to 100% (for example, by using the menu in the middle of the status bar) and compare
    the ruler on the screen to a real ruler, we see they don’t match.'

    parameter by pressing the ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1453844.png.jpg)
    key. If you check the AUTO-RESIZE WINDOW checkbox, the window size changes so
    it contains the same part of the image as before.

    But sometimes you may need several different views open at the same time. Suppose,
    for example, we are carefully retouching a photograph. We want a closeup view
    of the detail that we are retouching. At the same time, we want to see the effect
    of our work on the photograph at the size that it will be printed.

- en: 'To open multiple views of an image, select **Image: View > New View**. The
    new Image window that opens is another view of the same image, not a new copy
    of it. For example, on the left side of [Figure 10-30](ch10s04.html#two_views_of_the_same_image
    "Figure 10-30. Two views of the same image"), you see a seaside landscape photo
    with a zoom factor of 33.3%, and on the right side, you see the ripple of a small
    wave from the foreground of the photo using a zoom factor of 200%. When we do
    something to the image on the right side, the effect is immediately visible in
    the left-side window as well. Note that this feature isn’t as useful in single-window
    mode because in that mode you can’t look at two different images at the same time,
    even if both of them are open in GIMP. You can only shift from one view to the
    other and then back.'

    best way to do this is not by using the button on the window bar but rather by
    applying **Image: View > Fullscreen** or by pressing ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1453828.png.jpg),
    which is a toggle. The result is shown in [Figure 10-31](ch10s05.html#enlarging_the_image_window_to_full_scree
    "Figure 10-31. Enlarging the Image window to full screen"). When setting general
    parameters (see [Chapter 22](ch22.html "Chapter 22. Customizing GIMP")), you can
    also choose to minimize what’s displayed on screen to give your image more room.
    You can hide the rulers, the scroll bars, the status bar, and even the menu bar,
    as shown in this example. And you can recall them when needed with the menu button
    at the top left of the Image window (if the rulers are displayed) or by right-clicking
    the image.'

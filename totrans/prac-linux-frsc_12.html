<p class="noindent">In theory, an exhaustive forensic examination of a Linux system would include understanding the origin, purpose, and contents of every file and directory on the entire system. This is typically hundreds of thousands of files.<sup><a id="afoot01" href="footnotes.xhtml#afoot_01">1</a></sup> Clearly not all of these files are of forensic interest. Documenting every possible file and directory from a forensics perspective is infeasible. There are too many fringe use cases, and each distro and system administrator introduces their own files and applications. In addition, the free and open source landscape is in a state of perpetual change. New files are introduced and legacy files are deprecated.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_340"/>In this book, I have covered the analysis of a small number of these files and directories, but the coverage is far from complete. I made explicit decisions to include topics that cover the most frequent use cases a forensic examiner may encounter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When faced with an unknown file or directory, you can ask several questions to determine why it is there and how it got there. Where did the file come from? Is the file part of an installed software package? If not, does the ownership reveal who created it? Does the location of the file on the filesystem (its directory) give any indication of how or why it was created? What do you know about the owner and group of the file? Does the filename appear in any logs or configuration files? The timestamps show when the file was created, last modified/changed, and last accessed. Do these timestamps correlate with any activity in the logs? Were any other files created or deleted around this same time? Is the filename recorded in the shell history as part of a command typed by a user? What kind of file is it? Does the filename appear in any unallocated areas of the drive? Does an examination of the file contents reveal anything about the file’s origin or purpose? Asking and attempting to answer these questions will help an investigator understand the origin and purpose of files and directories on a Linux system.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Be cautious when researching the internet for information about a particular file or directory. Look for authoritative sources of information. If it is a software package or a certain application file type, find the project team’s website and look at their official documentation. Ultimately, the most authoritative information is the source code (especially if the documentation is out of date). If there are discrepancies between the source code and any documentation, the source code (with the matching version used) takes priority.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Peer-reviewed academic literature is another authoritative source of information. In the forensics community, papers published in peer reviewed academic journals like Forensic Science International’s <em>Digital Investigation</em> or at research conferences like DFRWS take an approach to analysis that has undergone scrutiny from other professionals in the field. These are only two examples of academic and practitioner literature (I’ve mentioned them because I am involved in both). There are other reputable digital forensics periodicals and conferences like the IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security and the annual conference of the Association of Digital Forensics Security and Law (ADFSL).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Maintain a healthy skepticism of blogs, forums, commercial sites, and search-engine-optimized web content for a given topic. Many blog posts, forum discussions, YouTube videos, and company white papers are excellent, accurate, and helpful; however, many are not. Following false or incorrect sources of information can have significant negative consequences in forensics. Criminals may never face justice, or worse, innocent people may be falsely implicated.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Many new forensics books focus on application analysis, cloud forensics, mobile forensics, big data analytics, and other new and popular areas. Topics such as operating system analysis might seem old and less exciting by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_341"/>comparison. But significant advancements to Linux have been made in the past decade, and digital forensics literature has not kept up. With this book, I have tried to fill that gap.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The Linux world is changing all the time and new features are added to the kernel on a regular basis. Follow the Linux kernel mailing list (LKML) for evidence of this! The adoption and continued development of systemd will change how we analyze userspace. Systemd is the new “system layer” between the kernel and users’ running applications. Also significant is the transition from X11 to Wayland together with the trend to abandon the traditional desktop metaphor. Discovering and understanding all the available forensic artifacts on a Linux system will continue to be a challenge.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This book has highlighted many areas that are beneficial to forensic investigators, and at the same time revealed areas that may pose privacy risks to users. Undoubtedly, many of the privacy issues will eventually be fixed and cease to provide traces of evidence. This is the natural evolution of digital forensics and is ultimately good for society. But don’t worry, new opportunities for gathering evidence are springing into existence just as fast as legacy sources are disappearing. A good forensic investigator always keeps on top of new developments in the field.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This book has completely avoided the topic of live system analysis and Linux memory analysis. I intentionally focused on postmortem analysis. There are enough excellent books on incident response that cover live analysis of running Linux systems, but very few take a “dead disk” analysis approach, which is crucial for the forensically sound investigation of severe criminal incidents. Covering only the analysis of postmortem forensic images has allowed far greater focus and depth, resulting in a more useful reference book. Attempting to cover both live and postmortem scenarios in a similarly sized manuscript would have diluted the content.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Whether you’re a professional forensics practitioner, a student learning about forensics, a forensic tool developer, or a researcher advancing the forensics field, I hope you have enjoyed this book. I hope you have found it a useful educational tool, and that going forward, you’ll continue to find it a helpful reference.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As a final word of encouragement to readers: learn! I was drawn to digital forensics and investigation because it’s a field in which you’re always learning. The investigative process is learning—learning about how events in an incident transpired. The digital forensics process is learning—learning how technologies are interacting with each other and reconstructing a sequence of technological activity. Digital forensics research and development is learning—learning to develop new tools and methods to overcome challenges and to understand complex technology to advance the body of knowledge.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Digital forensics is a fascinating field and Linux is a fun operating system. Enjoy them!</p>&#13;

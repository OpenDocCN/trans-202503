<p class="noindent">Heavy footsteps pounded the wooden deck above. Frank glanced around, assessing their limited options. The only hatch led up to the deck and the new arrivals. The hold itself was nearly empty, the crew having unloaded the cargo upon arriving in Usb. Trying to hide here would amount to standing in a corner and whispering “You can’t see me.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As Frank listed and discarded every possible option, including the rarely effective ploy of lying down and playing dead, he saw Notation pull out her badge and stand at attention.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What are you thinking?” he hissed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I am an officer of the law on an official investigation,” explained Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank shook his head in disbelief. “The ‘Stop in the name of the law’ routine isn’t about to work here. Or most places, for that matter. We’re on a smuggler’s ship, investigating the theft of police property. No one on the force even knows you’re here, do they? And I’d be willing to bet whoever is coming through that door knows that.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation opened her mouth to argue, but paused and closed it again. She slid her badge back into her jacket as a stream of large and surprisingly well-dressed thugs poured through the door. They <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_48"/>spread out in the hold and formed a loose circle around Frank and Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Ladies and gentlemen,” said Frank. “We have concluded our inspection and it appears that you are not carrying any rotting eels. Thank you for your patience as we strive to ensure the safety of this kingdom’s food supply. We’ll be on our way now.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">By way of reply, two of the larger thugs grabbed Frank’s arms. Together they lifted him off the ground and proceeded to carry him back up onto the deck. Years of experience had prepared Frank for this reaction and he had developed a technique for positioning himself so as to minimize discomfort, but he could still almost feel the bruises forming under their powerful grip.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Hey!” Notation’s shout indicated that she was being similarly escorted outside.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank blinked as they emerged into the sunlight. The men carried him to the middle of the deck and dumped him on the wooden floor. Notation thudded next to him, and the thugs again formed a loose circle around them.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank slowly pushed himself into a sitting position and eyed their captors. They swayed with the ship but otherwise didn’t move. They appeared to be waiting, which meant that whoever was in charge hadn’t arrived yet. Frank seized the opportunity and turned to the nearest thug.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What’s the plan then?” asked Frank. “Lock us away? Drop us over the side? Hand us over to your boss’s employer?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The man shrugged. “Don’t look at me, I’ve only been working here for fifteen days.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“A newbie, huh?” said Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The Vinettees were fanatical about limiting information. They only shared their plans with the most senior person on the crew. New hires were required to prove their loyalty as they worked their way up the ranks. To get any useful information, Frank would need to find the most senior person aboard.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_49"/>A plan started to form in Frank’s mind. The Vinettees’ crews always arranged themselves in order of seniority. It had something to do with mentorship—the most junior crew member served as a new hire’s mentor and so forth up the ranks. In group situations, they all tended to stand next to their mentors.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0049-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The circle of thugs was nothing more than a sorted array that had been bent into a loop. Binary search would almost work here, but it would have to be adapted to fit the organization of the data: a circle, rather than a straight line of values. Unfortunately, this meant that Frank didn’t know where the array started or ended. Quickly he developed a new algorithm to efficiently search for the most senior crew member. In this case, efficiency meant both minimizing the number of thugs with whom he would have to converse and maximizing his chances of getting answers before they caught on.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">He turned to the woman on the thug’s right. “How about you? Are you the veteran here then?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Nineteen days,” she said.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0049-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_50"/>Now Frank expected that he had an ordering—that seniority increased as he went counterclockwise around the circle. But he couldn’t be sure yet. As absurd as the possibility was, Fifteen-Days and Nineteen-Days could be the most junior and senior thugs, respectively. He had been careless with choosing how to start searches before; it never ended well. He need another data point. So he chose the middle of the remaining range of thugs.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“How about you?” he asked a woman across from Fifteen-Days.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Thirty-seven days,” replied the thug. “What’s it to you?”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0050-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">With this piece of information, his hunch of a counterclockwise ordering was confirmed. Therefore, he discarded everyone between Fifteen-Days and the person before Thirty-Seven-Days from consideration—the most senior thug, if it wasn’t Thirty-Seven-Days, would have to be counterclockwise from her, but before Fifteen-Days.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0050-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_51"/>Frank stifled a rising swell of annoyance. He had never faced such a junior crew before. He actually felt a little insulted. “This is getting embarrassing,” Frank said to their captors. “We were caught by a bunch of newbies. What are you all, the backup team?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What are you doing?” whispered Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“A modified binary search,” Frank growled back.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation sighed. “I figured that out. It looks like you’re searching for the most senior one. You’re not exactly being subtle. But why? And how do you know they’re standing in order?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank ignored her. He took a deep breath and refocused on the task at hand. He didn’t know how much time he had before The Boss showed up. He chose the middle of the remaining range. “And you?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“This is my third day,” replied the man, hesitantly.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Come on!” shouted Frank. “Really?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Three days? You’re not in training or anything?” Notation asked, sounding genuinely curious.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0051-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank refined his range again, accounting for the fact that the most senior person couldn’t be Three-Days, Fifteen-Days, or anyone in between.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank divided the remaining range in half again. “You must be a relative veteran then, right?” Frank asked.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Uh . . . this is my first day, sir,” stammered the thug. He began sweating profusely as everyone’s attention turned to him.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_52"/>Frank cursed under his breath.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Don’t call him sir,” shouted Nineteen-Days. “He’s our prisoner.”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0052-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank had now limited the search to a very small window. “And I suppose this is your first day too?” he asked the last thug under consideration. He didn’t bother hiding his disdain.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The woman laughed. “I’ve been with the Vinettees for over a month,” she said. “Forty-two days of keeping nosy cops out of the way.”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0052-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Bingo. “Really?” said Frank. “What are you doing here then?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The thug frowned. “What do you mean?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“The Vinettees usually reserve their senior henchmen for more important tasks. Babysitting a shipment of smuggled cabbages seems like a waste of your time,” he said, struggling to remember whether there had been anything about cabbages in the log. It was a reasonable bluff anyway. All smugglers dealt in cabbages at some point. The recent increase in cabbage taxes had practically doubled the black market trade in Usb.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_53"/>“Cabbages?” the woman scoffed. “I did the cabbage route on my first day. We have more important work now.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Really?” said Frank. “Move all the way up to carrots?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The thug turned a bright shade of red. Even though they often accounted for over 80 percent of a smuggler’s profit, somehow vegetable smuggling remained the embarrassing side of the business.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“No,” she said. “A hundred times better than carrots. A private contract.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Really?” said Frank. “I hear that fencing carrots is good business. Pays well, they say.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Oh, don’t worry about that,” said the thug with an air of smugness. “The League pays us well for our service. We were told—”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Mr. Runtime.” A familiar voice cut through the air. “Stop trying to weasel information out of my employees. You will find that the information is no more useful than it is challenging to procure. They, of course, know nothing of value.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank looked up to see Rebecca Vinettee join the circle. His stomach clenched.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0053-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_54"/>“And you are?” prompted Vinettee, looking at Officer Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“This is Susan Pointer from the Bureau of Food Safety, Pickled Eel Division,” said Frank. “We’re looking into a bad shipment of Usb Greytails.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Rebecca Vinettee made a soft tsking sound. “No, Mr. Runtime. I don’t think so.” She paused, studying Notation carefully. “If I am not mistaken, this is Officer Elizabeth Notation. First year on the police force.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I’m on an official—” started Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“No,” interrupted Rebecca Vinettee. “You are not on an official investigation, Officer Notation. I know all the officers currently assigned to official investigations, from grand theft aquatic all the way down to slug racing. My sources keep me well informed about such things, and you are not on any of their lists. But you <em>are</em> tres-passing on my ship. So the question is what to do with you?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I thought the question was ‘why?’” said Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Mr. Runtime,” said Rebecca Vinettee with exaggerated patience. “Please do not underestimate me. I know the why. I knew the why before you did. I also know the who, when, what, and even the how.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“But the question remains, how should I deal with two nosy officers—oh, my apologies. You are an officer no longer, are you, Frank? I should ask: How should I deal with a nosy officer and a nosy disgraced former officer?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank clenched his fists. His thoughts flashed back to his last month on the force and Rebecca’s mocking laugh as she was released from the cells. He hadn’t been able to build a case, at least not while following the book, and the captain had been forced to let her go.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“How about you bore us to death with a monologue?” asked Frank. “Why don’t you tell us about the League?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Rebecca laughed. “Don’t worry, Mr. Runtime, I have no intention of keeping you around long enough to bore. I had, of course, already decided how to deal with you, if you ever chanced to get in my way again. The question was merely a kindness to give you the illusion of control over your own demise.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_55"/>“Demise?” Notation squeaked.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Rebecca Vinettee nodded at the circle of henchmen, and they advanced, drawing an assortment of fancy weaponry from their expensive suits like magicians performing elaborate conjuring acts. One tall man produced a three-foot-long spiked club from under his tie; another thug slide a broadsword out of her sleeve.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Then, to absolutely everyone’s surprise, a barrel landed on the deck with a loud <em>thwack</em> and burst open, spraying pickled eels across the planks.</p>&#13;

<p class="sidebart"><strong>POLICE ALGORITHMS 101: ADAPTING YOUR BINARY SEARCH</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="sbsub"><em><strong>Excerpt from Professor Drecker’s Lecture</strong></em></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Not every computational problem you face during your career is going to have a nice, prepackaged solution. Sure, scholars have spent years studying a vast range of problems and writing up solutions. But in the field you’ll find new problems with new wrinkles. If you leave this class having just memorized a sheet of algorithms, you’re soon going to find yourself in deep trouble.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In order to handle novel problems, it is important to understand how an algorithm works and how it can be adapted to new problems. The basic idea behind binary search—using the structure in the data to repeatedly halve the search space—is more important than the details of a particular application. Using that one piece of intuition, you can adapt binary search to search circular (but still sorted) arrays or even determine the optimal temperature for your coffee, by testing warmer and cooler coffee until it’s “just right.”<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_56"/></p>&#13;

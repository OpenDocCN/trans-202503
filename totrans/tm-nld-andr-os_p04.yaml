- en: From the moment the iPhone was announced through the first year after Android
    1.0, everything was about the launches. Whether it was releasing the software
    in various SDK versions, iterating on the released platform from 1.0 forward,
    or launching a widening variety of devices, the team worked hard to hit deadline
    after deadline to get the platform out to an increasingly large audience.

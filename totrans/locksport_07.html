<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/17fig00.jpg"/></div>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, we’ll cover the general setup of a lever lockpicking competition, tools and locks you can expect to see there, and advice for preparing to win. We’ll give you tips for both running and competing in a lever lock competition, as well as some helpful dos and don’ts.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev103">The Competition Setup</h3>
<p class="noindent">Because of the cost of the tools and availability of the locks, competitions rarely have enough for everyone who wants to take part. The only fair way around this is a qualifier round using, for example, a single, easy lever lock with a short time limit. The fastest openings get through to the next rounds, which are head-to-head in the usual way. Generally, a certain number of preliminary rounds occur with four competitors each, and then a larger final round.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_326"/>The time limit, explained beforehand, is between five and nine minutes per lock. At the end of each time period, the locks are reset, and the entire field moves round-robin-style until all the contestants have picked all the locks. More contestants usually means less time per round.</p>
<p class="indent">The lock will already be mounted in a vise. Usually, the tools will also already be in place, and you won’t be able to see the operating parts of the lock. You likely won’t be allowed to touch the tools until the time starts, so always check beforehand to see whether a qualifier round or test period is scheduled.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll probably be standing, with the pick at waist level. It is both easier and faster to simply walk from lock to lock, leaving the setup in place. The pace can be quite fast; in 2019, the LockCon lever picking contest was a mere five minutes a round, on locks with four throws. Granted, you’re not running the 100-meter sprint in under 10 seconds, but not partying all night before the competition might help you maintain your stamina.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll be told how many times you must pick the lock; the most is four, and the least is one. Sometimes the lock will move a full rotation with each pick, and sometimes a half rotation. It can take as many as five half rotations, or as few as one, to complete the open.</p>
<p class="indent">Scoring is based on the number of openings, with the most openings winning the round. If a tie occurs for the highest number of openings, the fastest time wins.</p>
<p class="indent">As noted previously, lever lock competitions are fairly rare, with LockCon in the Netherlands (where Walter is competing in <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig1">Figure 17-1</a>) being the main one. For information about other contests, consult the groups listed in <a href="ch1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="lev104">Competition Tools</h3>
<p class="noindent">As we’ve noted in previous chapters, the competition’s organizers almost always provide the locks and the picking tools. (Make sure you ask, though!) The noncurtain lock pick will be a 2-in-1, and the curtain pick will be a wire picking arm and a separate tensioner of some form. A mounting block and vise will also be provided.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>You can pick a small lever lock in-hand with a wire pick and a tensioner by holding the tensioner in position in the lock, but that approach is far harder than with the lock mounted, and it can’t be done in competition or if the lock bolt faces the other way. Doing so with a 2-in-1 is impossible, unless you have three hands—hence, the necessity of a vise and block</em>.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="lev105">Competition Locks</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you no doubt know by now, practice is the most important part of competition prep. However, specific practice on the specific lock isn’t possible unless you know which lock type, brand, and model will be used, which is unlikely. Location will help give you a clue, so in this section we’ll review some locks you’ll encounter in European and UK competitions.</p>
<p class="indent">First, however, let’s briefly talk about locks you <em>won’t</em> find there. Some lever locks are unsuitable for competition. The Chubb 114, for instance, would be a terrible choice (see the 3G114 in <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig2">Figure 17-2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">When the Chubb 114 is new (unpicked), it’s extremely easy to pick. However, its knife-edged brass stump wears easily, and its levers rapidly take up the small amount of play from the manufacturing imperfections. Therefore, it quickly becomes much harder to pick, especially if it’s been subjected to lots of tension. Once “bedded in” with this wear, this lock can be nearly impossible to pick. This would obviously favor the first competitors, even if the same lock were used in each round (as is typically the case).</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch17fig2" src="../images/17fig02.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 17-2: A Chubb 3G114 with an antipick notch on the rear of the stump</em></p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_328"/><a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig3">Figure 17-3</a> shows levers for the 114. The antipicks work together to hinder picking and help defeat impressioning attacks by lifting the lever slightly away from the key. Note that the lever marked B (bottom middle) has no antipicks. Each lock has an A, B, or C lever without antipicks to ensure smooth operation under all circumstances, just as with many pin tumbler locks.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch17fig3" src="../images/17fig03.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 17-3: Chubb 114 levers</em></p>
<p class="indent">Locks used in competition should have steel stumps with rounded edges, and preferably steel levers.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title" id="ch17side1"><strong>DETECTOR MECHANISMS AND ANTIPRESSURE DEVICES</strong></p>
<p class="sbnoindent">Detector mechanisms and antipressure devices are just a couple of the often creative and advanced ways that lock designers have invented to prevent picking and other attacks. Chubb created the Detector, for example, hundreds of years ago after an English naval dock was robbed via lockpicking. When the wrong key or a picking tool is used and lifts the trigger lever(s) too high, the Detector jams in the locked state, indicating that it’s been tampered with. The only way to reset it and reallow normal locking is to turn a correct key the <em>wrong</em> way. Antipressure devices are designed to frustrate picking by, for example, jamming all the levers if the lock bolt is tensioned.</p>
<p class="sbindent">You won’t meet any of these in any contest, however, mainly because opening them in a few minutes without lots of preparation is far too hard. Fifty contestants with no open wouldn’t be much fun!</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec142"><em>European Competition Locks</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">In mainland European competitions, the double-bitted lever lock is most common. Often mounted on the back side of a door as a rim lock, with the resultant very long keys, these locks often also throw bolt work worthy of a safe: in three directions, requiring multiple turns of the key to open. Two complete rotations of the key will throw the bolt work four times, giving a high level of resistance to physical force, and the levers have four sets of gates that engage at different times.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_329"/>The good news is that these locks are fairly easy to pick if you have the dedicated tool for them. The bad news is that you don’t own that tool, and the bolt is 100 mm away through a small keyhole.</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike single-bitted locks, double-bitted locks often have only a single lever spring to reset the lock. The BODA shown in <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig4">Figure 17-4</a> works like a single-bitted lock, apart from the double-throw-in-one-turn operation, and you can’t push the levers back down.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch17fig4" src="../images/17fig04.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 17-4: The BODA (Finland) 42x double-bitted, eight-lever lock</em></p>
<p class="indent">You can see the single lever spring in the Mauer 71111 in <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig5">Figure 17-5</a>. In these locks, you use the lower half of the key to prevent the levers from lifting too high. The main difference in picking them is that, if you overlift, you can simply push the overlifted lever back down by pushing against the bottom of the lever.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch17fig5" src="../images/17fig05.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 17-5: The Mauer 71111</em></p>
<p class="indent">Notice that the Mauer 71111’s lever is lightly trapped in a true gate and can’t move up or down (although a picking arm on a Hobbs pick could push it up or down freely). The antipicks are fairly aggressive, but you can <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_330"/>skip them if you reduce the tension enough, and the lack of individual springs means that the whole lock won’t likely reset.</p>
<p class="indent">The other difference from single-bitted locks is that because of the absence of individual springs, in double-bitted locks the friction between adjacent levers tends to move them a little as you move their neighbors. You’ll frequently have to push the nonbinding levers back down, as they freely lift with the binding lever. You also need less force to move them, and they may or may not fall under gravity.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec143"><em>UK Competition Locks</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">UK lever locks are almost exclusively single-bitted keys and curtained locks on doors, but we also have hundreds of years of safe locks, containers, and padlocks, so you’re more likely to run into a variety in a competition. The locks could be noncurtained locks running from two to seven levers, with a huge difficulty range, or they could be curtained lever locks running from three to seven levers (though usually five).</p>
<p class="indent">Though you can pick a curtained lock in exactly the same way as a noncurtained one, you’ll find the kit required differs significantly. Gone is the beautifully lathe-turned, precision-fitted 2-in-1 tool; instead, you’ll use bits of bent wire and maybe a cut-down key! You might even see something like precision-bent wires and CNC wire EDM tensioners.</p>
<p class="indent">Don’t worry, though: the wire will lift the levers just as effectively, and the tension will work just the same too. Getting the hang of the different tooling styles will probably take you a while. Remember that any curtained door lock is a single throw, and the levers will be individually sprung (the only exception is the APECS LX5).</p>
<p class="indent">The locks you’ll most likely encounter are the UNION StrongBOLT and the ERA Fortress 2. For all practical purposes in picking, these locks are identical, and they are the most common British Standard lever locks around.</p>
<p class="block1">If you really want to know, the UNION has eight key cut depths, and the ERA has seven. That’s the only noteworthy difference when you’re using a wire curtain pick. In my opinion, the StrongBOLT is generally a slightly harder pick.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="lev106">Improving Your Odds of an Open</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now we’ll talk about a few other steps you can take to improve your chances of getting an open when you’re in a competition setting.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec144"><em>Controlling Your Nerves</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Keep your cool in the competition and under test. The adrenaline surge will numb your sense of feeling in your fingers, so you’ll be tempted to use more force than necessary. You’ll feel as if time slows down and yet somehow passes faster. Of course you want to win, but don’t let the moment get to you—that’s how you end up breaking things or failing to open your lock.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_331"/>Practice under pressure helps you get used to this; with a few competitions under your belt, you’ll find your nerves will calm down. (Then again, once you have a reputation for opening, you might get stressed for the <em>opposite</em> reason, so don’t put too much pressure on yourself, either!)</p>
<p class="indent">Practice on a variety of locks so you’re not flummoxed by an unfamiliar one in the moment. Similarly, figure out which technique works best for you to open fast. Do you hyperfocus on the noises coming from the levers? Do you count the taps and track the movement of the picking arm through the lever pack? Are you holding the tensioner effectively to get the best feedback from the tiny movements as the bolt shifts? Remember that competitions tend to be noisy!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec145"><em>Getting Intel on the Lock</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">So far, LockCon has yet to reveal the locks that will be or have been used in its competitions (the organizers obscure the brand and model on the locks they use). This is because the cost of swapping those locks for another type would be too high. In the MLA lever opening test, you have to tell the examiner what the lock is (multiple British Standard five-lever locks are assigned randomly, and the locksmith has to identify their lock via the keyhole, then open it, right-facing, within one hour). Since the organizers are unlikely to give much away, ask yourself what information you already have about the lock. What can you learn from the outside?</p>
<p class="indent">When you have a lot of time with a lock, you can try multiple methods of opening. In a competition, you want to get to the right method as quickly as possible. Let’s look at how to accomplish this.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Holding the Lock</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent"><em>Bolt pushing</em> (applying direct pressure on the end of the lock bolt to bind the levers) isn’t allowed and probably wouldn’t give you enough feedback on any decent lock, anyway. Most competitions have the <em>keep</em> (strike plate) screwed over the bolt, or some other defense, to prevent this. Plus, a curtained lock could end up out of sequence—meaning that the curtain is at the wrong rotation to drive the bolt—requiring the lock to be disassembled prior to the next round.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Examining the Lock</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">As mentioned, the competition organizers deliberately obscure the lock’s model or even the brand to avoid revealing significant information about the lock’s peculiarities. Still, you can look at the keyhole to determine whether it’s a single- or double-bitted lock. You can also check whether a curtain is present. A curtain won’t really make that big of a difference for the picking process, but you won’t be surprised to see a wire pick instead of a 2-in-1 or Hobbs tool.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_332"/>Feeling the Lock</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">The organizers won’t permit you to fiddle with the locks and picks beforehand—that’s cheating! But what can you learn when you’re allowed to touch the lock?</p>
<p class="indent">First, does the tool turn smoothly or does it need maintenance? The two parts of the picking tool must move separately and without binding or grinding, both forward and backward under the levers, and in rotation. Don’t confuse this with hitting the levers! Organizers usually check the tools between rounds, but if something seems wrong, speak up. Also say something if the pick simply spins freely—if a part has snapped off, you need to mention it right away.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, find the location of the levers, and, more importantly, the bolt. It’s usually at the far side of the lock, but can also be in the middle of the lever pack, or at the front if the lock is facing the other way (bolt facing right). Nearly all current lever locks (bolt facing left) have the levers sitting either on both sides of the bolt or in front, nearest to you and the lock cap. The tool will be able to reach all the levers by design, even if they’re on both sides of the bolt, but you must ensure that you apply the tension <em>to the bolt</em>, not a random lever.</p>
<p class="indent">After the competition starts, if you know the number of levers, you’ll be able to count them once to confirm. If you don’t know, you’ll have to find them and count them, probably twice or until you get the same result twice. Then check the spring pressure:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet">On locks with a single main spring, you’ll feel the spring as you tension the lock, and the levers will then “float” freely. You’ll be able to push them up and down with the picking tool with almost no force.</li>
<li class="bullet">On locks with individually sprung levers, you’ll always feel the spring pressure trying to return the lever to rest, unless it binds and doesn’t return, or gets caught in a (false or true) gate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Typically, levers are above the keyhole, but they can also be to the side (see <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig6">Figure 17-6</a>). When you have differently curved lever bellies, you’ll hit the bottom of some levers early, and others later. On some locks, this is a basis for decoding, but you’ll need free movement underneath the lever pack. Either your tool must allow this or you’ll be using a wire curtain pick, not a 2-in-1, which can be “scooped” under the bellies at certain angles. This takes practice to avoid disturbing the levers or overlifting them, possibly over the true gate height.</p>
<div class="imagec"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_333"/><img alt="Image" id="ch17fig6" src="../images/17fig06.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 17-6: A seven-lever safe lock with a three-way keyhole that allows mounting with the bolt facing up (as shown here), left, or downward. When the lock is positioned like this, the lever pack will be found on the right of, rather than above, the keyhole</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, what about antipick protections? The lock might not have any, or they might be disabled by the pick. You’ll need to figure this out as soon as possible and keep a mental note. Your picking tool will avoid a curtain or wards for you, and a mainspring that resets the levers will be disabled by the tensioner. (At the high end, the lock could have antipressure stumps and detector mechanisms, but you won’t see those in a regular lock and certainly not in competition.) Also keep in mind that you can drive a double-bitted lever back downward if it’s lifted too high.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Asking About the Lock</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">You’ll be briefed about the lock by the organizers. Unlike for the pin tumbler lockpicking competitions described in <a href="ch8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, asking others for intel about lever lockpicking is tricky. It’s poor form to ask what’s going on inside the lock rather than figuring it out for yourself, mainly because knowing that a certain lever should be immediately lifted high gives you a mighty advantage over someone who has to fight through the antipicks to get there. Also, <em>tryout keys</em>—keys that approximate true keys, which you simply try until the lock opens—might be perfectly legal, so if someone tells you that key 12 of the set opens the lock, you’re going to be in faster than anyone else!</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_334"/>We suggest keeping any specifics of the lock internals to yourself until after the competition is over. When in doubt, check with the competition organizers for how much discussion about the locks is allowed.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev107">Competition Dos and Don’ts</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now we’ll go over a few final dos and don’ts to improve your odds of success. First, remember to hold the picking tool perpendicular to the lock case (see <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig7">Figure 17-7</a>). Accidentally tilting the tool up, down, left, or right is easy during the excitement of competition, but doing so will make your life more difficult, as it will compress the pack in an uncontrolled manner.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch17fig7" src="../images/17fig07.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 17-7: Keep your picking tool square to the lock face. If you compress the pack, take care to pull the tensioner straight outward, not tilting it, as the picking arm will hit multiple levers if you do</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Approach the lock with care. Test what the lock feels like inside; then draw your conclusions about the way it works. You’ll be able to see the keyway, and that will reveal whether the key is single- or double-bitted. You already know that most single-bitted locks are individually sprung levers, and most double-bitted locks use a single mainspring. Confirm this when you find the lever pack(s).</p>
<p class="indent">Keep your cool, and don’t be tense or cramped or use too much force. This advice holds true in any lockpicking setting.</p>
<p class="indent">Changing tension to go from clockwise to counterclockwise or vice versa, or changing sides of the lock, won’t be an option. However, changing tools might be allowed, depending on whether you have another tool available. If you aren’t using your own tools, though, you’ll have to stick with the one the competition has provided. Have confidence in the tool!</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_335"/><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>For example, if you’re feeling desperate in the last few seconds, you could swap to a J wire on a single-bitted lock—but even with the tool right there, you’d better have at least 45 seconds to allow enough time to swap. Odds are good that changing tools won’t be allowed, though</em>.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">You might consider differences in approach for the final round(s) as opposed to the first round(s), given that you have a more difficult lock and more time. However, as a rule of thumb, stick with what’s been working! Bind and nudge, bind and nudge. Figure out where the antipicks are, reset and lift higher, and then bind and nudge, bind and nudge . . . If you can skip through the antipicks, remember how you did it in the earlier rounds—drop the tension off, keep light pressure on the target lever, pop it up and past the false gate, and repeat until open!</p>
<p class="indent">If you get completely stuck, you can always reset the lock, taking it back to a known state. Make certain to reset the lock fully, though. For some locks with square antipicks, completely releasing the tension won’t reset the lock from an antipick, and in the extreme, you may need to drive the bolt back to fully locked to reset it. Likewise, with a single mainspring lock, you may need to turn the tension back a fair way to fully reset the lever pack.</p>
<p class="indent">Keep in mind that you might need to turn the lock more than once to open it. You <em>absolutely cannot</em> spin the picking tool to “flip” the lock around, as you can with a plug spinner on a pin tumbler lock. The design of the levers is such that they’re already blocking the stump’s next movement as they allow the first one. You’ll bend or break something and get thrown out. Instead, you’ll need to pick the lock again.</p>
<p class="indent">Recall and apply what you learned in <a href="ch16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a>. Remember that for many double-bitted locks, the key is symmetrical, meaning the low lifts and the high lifts are reversed, so this would be your best place to start when picking the second throw. This isn’t the case for the best multithrow, double-bitted locks, where the two sets of bittings are independent. Even the best double-throw locks, however, must have the same first and third, then second and fourth, lever alignments, so the first high/low combination will work the same on the third turn, and so on.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev108">Running Your Own Lever Lockpicking Competition</h3>
<p class="noindent">If you decide to run your own competition, be prepared for budget shock. The typical equipment will set you back a few hundred dollars (or pounds) per competitor. You’ll need an extra set of lock tools as well as a spare of everything else. Therefore, four competitors will need five lockpicking sets.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll need a selection of locks of various difficulties. Some will be too easy and others too hard, and you’ll want to keep track of this as the rounds progress so that you can, perhaps, remove the easy locks from the final round. You might also want to throw in a lock that no one beat in the semifinals as a potent test of skill differentiation. Don’t go overboard with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_336"/>this idea, though—having no openings in the final will likely be boring and frustrating! Aim for the easier end of the range. You need to have some openings within the timescale you set.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s look at a couple of LockCon competition setups to see what kind of equipment and cost might be involved.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec146"><em>2014 LockCon</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">The 2014 LockCon competition run by Jord Knaap used lower-end secondhand locks, though unmodified. These were the identical make and model from several manufacturing years by a safe company that used the lock on an internal compartment. These had four levers, and the build quality appeared to vary little over the decades. These locks were simply held in a vise, with the bolts visible, and the competitors were forbidden from touching the lock itself (see <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig8">Figure 17-8</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">However, it’s incredibly unlikely that anyone other than a dedicated safe technician would ever have the opportunity to collect 16 or 20 locks of the same make and model for a contest. Knaap, being a skilled machinist and toolmaker, made the picks himself.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch17fig8" src="../images/17fig08.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 17-8: LockCon 2014 competition lock</em></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec147"><em>2019 LockCon</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">The 2019 LockCon lever lockpicking competition was organized and sponsored by Ivo Poletto, founder and owner of Parmakey in Italy. The Italian team running the competition used an Italian-made, double-bitted, four-throw safe lock (that is, two complete turns move the bolt four times) with an <em>electronically indicating</em> bolt position switch added, meaning that a light on each lock showed the bolt’s current position (see <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig9">Figure 17-9</a>). The first pick would turn the lock 180°, the second 360°, the third 540°, and the final the full 720°, and each turn would be tracked by the lights, which allowed the judges and audience to see each competitor’s progress and the timekeepers to record accurate times.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_337"/>The lock make and model still hasn’t been revealed, as the organizers want to use the locks again in future competitions and don’t want to give a tactical advantage to anyone who might buy and study those specific locks. The locks used were modified to make them more easily pickable (some levers or antipick features may have been removed), and, being relatively high-end, they didn’t observe the usual “high becomes low on the next throw” pattern, meaning they’re like two separate locks from a picking perspective.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch17fig9" src="../images/17fig09.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 17-9: LockCon 2019 competition lock</em></p>
<p class="indent">These custom, identical competition rigs were clearly not cheap! The locks themselves are over $60 (€50) each. The tools were custom-made to suit the lock and cost more than double that. Parmakey made 10 picking tools and brought 10 locks, and the electronic mounting block obscured the entire lock. (Seeing a round trio of bolts or the faceplate, for instance, would give an advantage to anyone familiar with the lock.)</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec148"><em>2022 LockCon</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Nigel ran a small lever lockpicking contest at the 2022 event, using a single-throw, curtained, five-lever Kibb deadlock (see <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig10">Figure 17-10</a>). Four of the locks were modified such that the bolt couldn’t be fully retracted, instead hitting a microswitch, which in turn stopped the electronic timer. This prevented issues with the lock ever needing to be reset with a key. Ten sets of curtain-picking tools were supplied too.</p>
<div class="imagec"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_338"/><img alt="Image" id="ch17fig10" src="../images/17fig10.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 17-10: The single-throw, curtained, five-lever Kibb deadlock used at LockCon 2022</em></p>
<p class="indent">You can see some typical lever modifications in <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig11">Figure 17-11</a>. The top lever is unmodified, with square gate antipicks. The antipicks in Lever A have been filed almost completely away, meaning this lever binds very late in the picking order and is easily set correctly. Filing away the bottom edge of the square gate in Lever B meant that lifting the lever out of the antipick was far easier than having to do a full reset. One lever was also completely gutted into nothing more than a fancy spacing washer, which the stump would never touch unless the lever was lifted far, far too high.</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig12">Figure 17-12</a> shows the system in use. The heavy vise holds the lock in place securely. The red and black wires provide power for the timer, while the white wire goes inside the lock case to the microswitch. The curtain pick is one of Nigel’s own design.</p>

<p class="notep"><em>A neat trick from the MLA exam is to screw the keep directly to the face of the block holding the lock. This prevents someone from gaining access to the bolt or identifying the lock by peering at the faceplate. In <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17fig12">Figure 17-12</a>, the keep is bolted directly to the lock, and the remaining gap is then covered with tape</em>.</p>

<p class="indent">The plan for this event was to swap in another set of unmodified levers for the top four players as a grand finale. However, despite the levers being modified, gates widened, and antipicks removed, the effectively four-lever “qualifier” lock turned out to be far too hard, with very few people opening it within 10 minutes even after multiple attempts.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec149"><em>Other Hosting Considerations</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, running one of these contests is a big ask. The investment of time and money is pretty high. The lowest price for tooling would be around the $87 (£70) mark, and while the locks might be relatively cheap, they would require modifications to ensure opening in a seven-minute round. For example, you’ll need a quick way to reset multithrow locks if they’ve only been thrown incompletely. You’ll also need to have the standard key modified to work in this scenario that the lock was surely designed to prevent; this modification will be easier with some models than others.</p>
<p class="indent">All lever locks should be new or fairly new, and you’ll need to make sure they’ve been serviced and made as similar as possible. Add in a vise and probably a block custom-made to hold the lock, and you’ll be easily above $125 (£100) per station.</p>

<p class="noindent">The tips and processes outlined here should give you a definite edge over your fellow competitors. Try to get some generic lever locks and picks and then practice some actual picking, and we’ll see you on the podium soon!</p>
<p class="indent">Should you choose to run your own events, at least now you’re aware of the potential scale of the undertaking. But don’t let that put you off. If you get creative, you might be able to find ways around the challenges. And if you do run an event, we hope you’ll send us an invite!</p>

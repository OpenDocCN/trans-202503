The files include separate <span class="emphasis"><em>.blend</em></span> files for each project (corresponding to each chapter in the book) and each project in its final state at the end of each chapter (where relevant). These resources should allow you to look in-depth at the workings of each project and to examine how each one takes shape. Also included are the textures used for each project, <span class="emphasis"><em>.blend</em></span> files with some useful brushes for sculpting and MatCap materials, and a GIMP brush that you can use in your own projects. Links to the textures from CGTextures (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cgtextures.com/" target="_top">http://www.cgtextures.com/</a>)are listed in a text file.</p><p>The files are licensed under the Creative Commons noncommercial attribution (CC-BY-NC) license.</p></section></body></html>

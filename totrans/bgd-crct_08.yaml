    either set the output (Q) to high or reset it to low. Q is always the opposite

    see that it’s connected to the output of the flip-flop. This means that if the
    flip-flop is “set,” the output is high; otherwise, it is low. If you look at the
    input to the flip-flop, you’ll see that the two comparators handle setting and
    resetting the flip-flop. This means that the pins responsible for making the output
    turn on and off are pins 2 and 6.

    the voltage on pin 2 goes lower than one-third of V[CC], comparator 1 outputs
    high and sets the flip-flop, which in turn sets the output high. Pin 6 is labeled
    *Threshold*; when its voltage exceeds two-thirds of the V[CC], it is responsible
    for resetting the output to low.

    project’s circuit, pins 2 and 6 are connected to each other, so when the voltage
    on these pins goes high, the output goes low. When the voltage on these pins goes
    low, the output goes high. That means you need to switch the voltage on these
    pins between high and low in order to switch the output between low and high.

    the chip, pin 7 is connected to a transistor, as shown in the figure. The transistor
    is controlled by ![image](../images/qbar.jpg), the opposite value of the output.
    This means that when the output is low, the transistor gets a high value and turns
    on, connecting pin 7 to ground. Otherwise, the transistor is off and leaves pin
    7 unconnected.

    That means pin 2 (Trigger) is low, which means pin 3 (the output) is high. This
    also means that pin 7 (Discharge) is not connected to anything internally.
  id: totrans-45

    the voltage on its positive pin will begin to rise. This means the voltage on
    pin 6 (Threshold) is increasing, too. When the voltage becomes high enough on
    Threshold, the output changes from high to low, and pin 7 (Discharge) is connected
    internally to ground.

    to discharge (hence the pin name Discharge) through R2, down to ground at pin
    7\. So the voltage across the capacitor decreases and continues to do so until
    the voltage on pin 2 is so low that it “triggers.” When it triggers, the output
    switches from low to high, and pin 7 is disconnected from ground again.

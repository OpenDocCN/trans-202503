    how to program—how to use computers to solve problems—is only half the battle.
    It’s a critical part of your skillset, yet to be an effective software engineer,
    you need other skills that are not taught in school. *The Missing README* will
    teach you these skills.

    software, and describe behaviors and approaches that make for stronger teams and
    better teammates. We’ll give you practical advice on how to get help, write design
    documents, work on old code, be on-call, plan your work, and interact with your
    manager and team.

- en: This book doesn’t contain everything you’ll need to know—an impossible task
    that would make for an exhausting read. Instead, we focus on the most important
    information not usually covered in undergraduate computer science curricula. These
    topics are deep, so we end each chapter with a “Level Up” section containing recommended
    reading if you want more information.

    a company. The middle group expands your technical education: writing production-quality
    code, effective testing, code reviews, continuous integration and deployment,
    design documents, and architectural best practices. The final three chapters cover
    softer skills, such as Agile planning, working with your manager, and career advice.'

    rapidly growing, VC-funded, pre-IPO Silicon Valley companies. Your setting might
    be different, and that’s fine. Specifics differ from company to company, but the
    fundamentals are universal.

    we plan to give to new engineers we welcome to our teams. By the end, you’ll know
    what it takes to be a professional software engineer. Let’s get started!'

- en: There’s general agreement that the launch of Droid is when Android’s growth
    really started. But even so, Android device sales lagged far behind iOS at the
    time, and other phone manufacturers still had significant market share at the
    time.

  zh: 普遍认为，Droid的发布标志着Android真正开始增长。但即便如此，Android设备的销量在当时仍远远落后于iOS，而其他手机制造商仍然占据着相当大的市场份额。
- en: But in 2010, things really started to change, as other manufacturers came out
    with their own Android phones. Then it wasn’t just people buying the single Verizon
    phone, or Android fans buying G1s or Nexus phones—it was people all over the world
    buying all kinds of different Android phones.

  zh: 但到了2010年，局势真的开始发生变化，因为其他厂商也推出了自己的Android手机。于是，情况不再是人们只购买单一的Verizon手机，或是Android粉丝购买G1或Nexus手机，而是全球各地的人们购买各种不同的Android手机。
- en: Hiroshi talked about the OEM effect on the ecosystem. “The OEMs need to build
    devices. So by the time the next year came on, we started getting the Galaxy series,
    and then it really became sort of this mainstream product. It’s the traditional
    partnership thing, where there’s a lag. A turbo lag. There’s a little bit of lag
    in the beginning while things are spooling up. That’s what G1 and Droid were,
    just the spool-up period for the industry. And then all the partners, OEMs, kicked
    in, their products started launching, and that’s when the hockey-stick started.”

  zh: Hiroshi谈到了OEM对生态系统的影响。“OEM厂商需要制造设备。所以到了第二年，我们开始看到Galaxy系列的推出，然后它真的成为了一款主流产品。这是传统的合作伙伴关系，存在滞后效应。是的，有些滞后。最初的阶段总是有一些延迟，直到事情开始运转。这就是G1和Droid的意义，它们只是行业的启动阶段。然后所有的合作伙伴和OEM厂商都加入了，他们的产品开始发布，这时行业的飞跃就开始了。”

- en: It’s impossible to deny the positive impact that Samsung has had on Android;
    they are the largest manufacturer of Android-based devices, and their Samsung
    *Galaxy* devices are *the* brand name in Android phones. Even the “exploding phone”
    problem with the Note 7 batteries,^([1](#c46-footnote-1)) an issue that would
    have decimated smaller companies, didn’t keep people from rushing to buy new devices
    when they were available.

    7电池“爆炸”问题^([1](#c46-footnote-1))，一个可能让小公司彻底崩溃的问题，也没有阻止人们在新设备推出时争相购买。
- en: Tom Moss signed up Samsung as an Android partner while he was living in Japan.
    Samsung was not the first to market with Android; they took some time to join
    the ecosystem. But when they did, they were all in.

  zh: Tom Moss在他居住在日本时签下了三星作为Android的合作伙伴。三星并不是最早推出Android的公司，他们花了一些时间才加入这个生态系统。但当他们加入时，他们全力以赴。
- en: “My job wasn’t just to cut deals. My job was to help foster an ecosystem. Part
    of that effort was to make sure that there was a balance in the force. At the
    time, HTC had this huge advantage over everyone else. The second phone, the third
    phone was HTC. They were charging a really high price to carriers for Android
    phones, which was bad because that would translate to a higher price for consumers.

  zh: “我的工作不仅仅是达成交易。我的工作是帮助推动生态系统的建设。努力的一部分是确保生态系统中力量的平衡。那时，HTC相对于其他厂商有着巨大的优势。第二款、第三款手机是HTC的。他们向运营商收取了非常高的Android手机价格，这不好，因为这将转嫁给消费者，导致更高的售价。”
- en: “The point was to try and create this equal. We really needed an active ecosystem
    of OEMs competing with each other. So a big part of my job was not just signing
    an OEM—it was helping them to actually do something with it. With Samsung, for
    example, I had selected them to be our first launch phone for China.” That phone
    didn’t end up launching, but Samsung phones eventually launched elsewhere.

  zh: “我们的目标是创造一种平衡的局面。我们确实需要一个活跃的OEM生态系统，彼此竞争。所以我的工作不仅仅是签约OEM，而是帮助他们真正地利用这个机会。例如，在与三星的合作中，我选定他们作为我们在中国的首个发布手机。”虽然这款手机最终没有推出，但三星的手机最终还是在其他地方发布了。
- en: Tom talked about the changes the company made when they adopted Android, including
    committing a large marketing budget for these new Android-based devices. “Samsung
    believed. Back when OEMs weren’t spending anything, they were spending co-marketing
    to create the Galaxy brand.

- en: “In Japan, I know they licensed Darth Vader from Lucasfilm, they had Ken Watanabe^([2](#c46-footnote-2))
    as their spokesman. They hired thousands of engineers, designers . . . everything.
    JK Shin^([3](#c46-footnote-3)) bet the farm on Android for smartphones. They were
    the first to really spend on the last mile. They were the first to think about
    having Samsung sales reps in stores to help promote it, having little areas in
    the store. They did brilliant execution.

- en: “The technology and the phones caught up later to where the business and sales
    went. But really, it was led by this strategy of marketing and sales that allowed
    them to leapfrog, and then their devices got better and better and better.”

- en: “They did that brilliant marketing campaign of pitting them against the iPhone
    directly. They were kind of making fun of the iPhone, and people are like ‘Who’s
    this idiot company putting itself against the iPhone?’ But they changed the conversation

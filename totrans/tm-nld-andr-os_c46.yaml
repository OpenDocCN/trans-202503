    really started. But even so, Android device sales lagged far behind iOS at the
    time, and other phone manufacturers still had significant market share at the
    time.

    with their own Android phones. Then it wasn’t just people buying the single Verizon
    phone, or Android fans buying G1s or Nexus phones—it was people all over the world
    buying all kinds of different Android phones.

    devices. So by the time the next year came on, we started getting the Galaxy series,
    and then it really became sort of this mainstream product. It’s the traditional
    partnership thing, where there’s a lag. A turbo lag. There’s a little bit of lag
    in the beginning while things are spooling up. That’s what G1 and Droid were,
    just the spool-up period for the industry. And then all the partners, OEMs, kicked
    in, their products started launching, and that’s when the hockey-stick started.”

    they are the largest manufacturer of Android-based devices, and their Samsung
    *Galaxy* devices are *the* brand name in Android phones. Even the “exploding phone”
    problem with the Note 7 batteries,^([1](#c46-footnote-1)) an issue that would
    have decimated smaller companies, didn’t keep people from rushing to buy new devices
    when they were available.

    Samsung was not the first to market with Android; they took some time to join
    the ecosystem. But when they did, they were all in.

    of that effort was to make sure that there was a balance in the force. At the
    time, HTC had this huge advantage over everyone else. The second phone, the third
    phone was HTC. They were charging a really high price to carriers for Android
    phones, which was bad because that would translate to a higher price for consumers.

    of OEMs competing with each other. So a big part of my job was not just signing
    an OEM—it was helping them to actually do something with it. With Samsung, for
    example, I had selected them to be our first launch phone for China.” That phone
    didn’t end up launching, but Samsung phones eventually launched elsewhere.

    committing a large marketing budget for these new Android-based devices. “Samsung
    believed. Back when OEMs weren’t spending anything, they were spending co-marketing
    to create the Galaxy brand.

    as their spokesman. They hired thousands of engineers, designers . . . everything.
    JK Shin^([3](#c46-footnote-3)) bet the farm on Android for smartphones. They were
    the first to really spend on the last mile. They were the first to think about
    having Samsung sales reps in stores to help promote it, having little areas in
    the store. They did brilliant execution.

    directly. They were kind of making fun of the iPhone, and people are like ‘Who’s
    this idiot company putting itself against the iPhone?’ But they changed the conversation
    from Android vs. iOS to iPhone versus Samsung Galaxy.

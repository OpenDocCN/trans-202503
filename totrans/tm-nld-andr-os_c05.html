<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">W</span>hen Android met with Google, Larry Page observed that it would make sense for Google to acquire the small company, to help them build a platform that would enable Google to enter the mobile market. </p>
<p>While both parties agreed in principle, there were many details to be ironed out. Nick recalled two large issues that Android needed to resolve with Google. The first was money: they needed to agree on the valuation of the company and how they would be paid, both initially and in ongoing milestone payments after the team joined. The second issue was commitment: Android wanted to make sure that they would actually get to accomplish the original goal and not just get sucked up into the larger company and forgotten. They needed Google to agree to support Android’s efforts after the acquisition and provide internal support on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>The negotiations began in the Spring of 2005. But Rich Miner had a problem: a family vacation conflicted with these time-sensitive meetings. He ended up doing both in parallel, calling in to the meetings from a sailboat in the British Virgin Islands. “I had to find ports that had mobile phone <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_34" title="34"/>coverage. I’d have to have the boat with everybody off on the beach enjoying themselves during these two-hour negotiation phone calls.</p>
<p>“One of the things we were concerned about was, ‘This isn’t strategic to Google. You guys haven’t even started focusing on WAP<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c05-footnote-1" id="c05-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> or any mobile stuff. We think this is going to be a lot of work, require resources. What happens if you don’t want to do this? How do we know we’re going to get the resources we need to be successful?’”</p>
<p>Larry Page suggested they go talk with Jonathan Rosenberg, a Google executive in charge of product and marketing. Rich remembered his advice: “‘Google’s different from other companies. A lot of other companies, when projects aren’t going well, they throw a lot of resources at it. At Google, we like to give resources to things that are going well. So if you do what you’re going to do and you’re executing, you’ll get more resources.’ That was, in essence, his Leap of Faith talk; why we should, if we believe in ourselves, do this because we’ll get the resources if we’re executing.”</p>
<p>The Android team came back to the table (and the boat), hammered out a deal, and the team started at Google on July 11, 2005.</p>
<p>A few weeks after the Android team started at Google, they were again presenting the pitch deck. This time, it was at an internal meeting at Google, pitching to a group of executives. Andy and others were showing what this newly acquired team was planning to do. Swetland described the meeting: “We showed the demo we had. Andy was running through the deck. I remember when he got to the monetization thing, Larry cut him off and said ‘Don’t worry about that. I want you guys to build the best possible phone and we’ll figure out the rest later.’”</p>

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c05-footnoteref-1" id="c05-footnote-1">1.</a></sup>  WAP = Wireless Application Protocol, which was introduced in 1999. Prior to the iPhone, there was a push in the industry for a parallel web that would work better on mobile devices. Websites use HTML to describe web pages, WAP sites use WML, a much more limited language tuned for the lower capabilities of mobile devices at the time. Most mobile devices didn’t offer full web access (Danger’s Hiptop phones were notable exceptions), so carriers expected mobile devices to support WAP.</p></aside>

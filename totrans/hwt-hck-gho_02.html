<p class="ChapterIntro">Pentesters and red teamers get excited about setting up and tuning their infrastructure just as much as they do about writing their engagement reports; that is to say, not at all. To them, the thrill is all in the exploitation, lateral movement, and privilege escalation. Building a secure infrastructure is dull paperwork. If they accidentally leak their IP in the target’s log dashboard, so what? They’ll owe the team a beer for messing up, the blue team will get a pat on the back for finding and exposing the attack, and everyone can start afresh the next day.</p>

<p>	A quick and crude glossary in case you’re new to the InfoSec world: <em>pentesters</em> exhaustively assess the security of a (usually) scoped application, network, or system. <em>Red teamers</em> assess the detection maturity of a company by performing real-world attacks (no scope, in theory). The <em>blue teamers</em> are the defenders.</p>

<p>Things are different in the real world. There are no do-overs for hackers and hacktivists, for instance. They do not have the luxury of a legally binding engagement contract. They bet their freedom, nay, their lives, on the security of their tooling and the anonymity of their infrastructure. That’s why in each of my books, I insist on writing about some basic operational security (OpSec) procedures and how to build an anonymous and efficient hacking infrastructure: a quick how-to-stay-safe guide in this ever-increasingly authoritarian world we seem to be forging for ourselves. We start this guide with how to become as anonymous online as possible, using a virtual private network (VPN), Tor, bouncing servers, and a replaceable and portable attack infrastructure.</p>
<p>If you are already intimate with current Command and Control (C2) frameworks, containers, and automation tools like Terraform, you can just skip ahead to Chapter 4, where the actual hacking begins.</p>
<h2 id="h1-501263c01-0001">VPNs and Their Failings</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">I would hope that in 2021, just about everyone knows that exposing their home or work IP address to their target website is a big no-no. Yet, I find that most people are comfortable snooping around websites using a VPN service that promises total anonymity—one they registered with using their home IP address, maybe even with their own credit card, along with their name and address. To make matters worse, they set up that VPN connection from their home laptop while streaming their favorite Netflix show and talking to friends on Facebook.</p>
<p>Let’s get something straight right away. No matter what they say, VPN services will always, <em>always</em> keep some form of logs: IP address, DNS queries, active sessions, and so on. Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of a naïve internaut for a second and pretend that there are no laws forcing every access provider to keep basic metadata logs of outgoing connections—such laws exist in most countries, and no VPN provider will infringe them for your measly $5 monthly subscription, but please indulge this candid premise. The VPN provider has hundreds if not thousands of servers in multiple datacenters around the world. They also have thousands of users—some on Linux machines, others on Windows, and a spoiled bunch on Macs. Could you really believe it’s possible to manage such a huge and heterogeneous infrastructure without something as basic as logs?</p>
<aside epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>
<section class="note">
<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
<p>	<em>Metadata</em> refers to the description of the communication—which IP address talked to which IP, using which protocol, at which time, and so on—but not its content.</p>
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>
</section>
</aside>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="5" id="Page_5"/>Without logs, the technical support would be just as useless and clueless as the confused client calling them to solve a problem. Nobody in the company would know how to start fixing a simple DNS lookup problem, let alone mysterious routing issues involving packet loss, preferred routes, and other networking witchcraft. Many VPN providers feel obliged to vociferously defend their log-<em>less</em> service to keep up with competitors making similar claims, but this is a falsehood that has led to a pointless race to the bottom, powered by blatant lies—or “marketing,” as I believe they call it these days.</p>
<p>The best you can hope for from a VPN provider is that they do not sell customer data to the highest bidder. Don’t even bother with free providers. Invest in your privacy, both in time and money. I recommend starting with AirVPN and ProtonVPN, which are both serious actors in the business.</p>
<p>This same perception of anonymity applies to Tor (The Onion Router, <a href="https://www.torproject.org" class="LinkURL">https://www.torproject.org</a>), which promises anonymous passage through the internet via a network of nodes and relays that hide your IP address. Is there any reason you should blindly trust that first node you contact to enter the Tor network any more than the unsolicited phone call promising a long-lost inheritance in exchange for your credit card number? Sure, the first node only knows your IP address, but maybe that’s too much information already.</p>
<h2 id="h1-501263c01-0002">Location, Location, Location</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">One way to increase your anonymity is to be careful of your physical location when hacking. Don’t get me wrong: Tor is amazing. VPNs are a great alternative. But when you do rely on these services, always assume that your IP address—and hence, your geographical location and/or browser fingerprint—is known to these intermediaries and can be discovered by your final target or anyone investigating on their behalf. Once you accept this premise, the conclusion naturally presents itself: to be truly anonymous on the internet, you need to pay as much attention to your physical trail as you do to your internet fingerprint.</p>
<p>If you happen to live in a big city, use busy train stations, malls, or similar public gathering places that have public Wi-Fi to quietly conduct your operations. Just another dot in the fuzzy stream of daily passengers. However, be careful not to fall prey to our treacherous human pattern-loving nature. Avoid at all costs sitting in the same spot day in, day out. Make it a point to visit new locations and even change cities from time to time.</p>
<p>Some places in the world, like China, Japan, the UK, Singapore, the US, and even some parts of France, have cameras monitoring streets and public places. In that case, an alternative would be to embrace one of the oldest tricks in the book: war driving. Use a car to drive around the city looking for public Wi-Fi hotspots. A typical Wi-Fi receiver can catch a signal up to 40 meters (~150 feet) away, which you can increase to a couple hundred meters (a thousand feet) with a directional antenna, like Alfa Networks’ <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="6" id="Page_6"/>Wi-Fi adapter. Once you find a free hotspot, or a poorly secured one that you can break into—WEP encryption and weak WPA2 passwords are not uncommon and can be cracked with tools like Aircrack-ng and Hashcat—park your car nearby and start your operation. If you hate aimlessly driving around, check out online projects like WiFi Map, at <a href="https://www.wifimap.io" class="LinkURL">https://www.wifimap.io</a>, that list open Wi-Fi hotspots, sometimes with their passwords.</p>
<p>Hacking is really a way of life. If you are truly committed to your cause, you should fully embrace it and avoid being sloppy at all costs.</p>
<h2 id="h1-501263c01-0003">The Operation Laptop</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Now that we have taken care of the location, let’s get the laptop situation straight. People can be precious about their laptops, with stickers everywhere, crazy hardware specs, and, good grief, that list of bookmarks that everyone swears they’ll go through one day. That’s the computer you flash at the local conference, not the one you use for an operation. Any computer you use to rant on Twitter and check your Gmail inbox is pretty much known to most government agencies. No number of VPNs will save your sweet face should your browser fingerprint leak somehow to your target.</p>
<p>For hacking purposes, we want an ephemeral operating system (OS) that flushes everything away on every reboot. We store this OS on a USB stick, and whenever we find a nice spot to settle in, we plug it into the computer to load our environment.</p>
<p>Tails <em>(</em><a href="https://tails.boum.org/" class="LinkURL">https://tails.boum.org/</a>) is the go-to Linux distribution for this type of usage. It automatically rotates the MAC address, forces all connections to go through Tor, and avoids storing data on the laptop’s hard disk. (Conversely, traditional operating systems tend to store parts of memory on disk to optimize parallel execution, an operation known as <em>swapping</em>.) If it was good enough for Snowden, I bet it’s good enough for almost everyone. I recommend setting up Tails OS and storing it on an external drive before doing anything else.</p>
<p>Some people are inexplicably fond of Chromebooks. These are minimal operating systems stacked on affordable hardware that only support a browser and a terminal. Seems ideal, right? It’s not. It’s the worst idea ever, next to licking a metal pole in the wintertime. We’re talking about an OS developed by Google that requires you to log in to your Google account, synchronize your data, and store it on Google Drive. Need I go on? There are some spinoffs of Chromium OS that disable the Google synchronization part, such as NayuOS, but the main point is that these devices were not designed with privacy in mind and under no circumstances should they be used for anonymous hacking activities. And if they were, then launch day must have been hilarious at Google.</p>
<p>Your operation laptop should only contain volatile and temporary data, such as browser tabs, a copy-paste of commands, and so on. If you absolutely need to export huge volumes of data, make sure to store that data in an encrypted fashion on portable storage.</p>
<h2 id="h1-501263c01-0004"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="7" id="Page_7"/>Bouncing Servers</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Our laptop’s only purpose is to connect us to a set of servers that hold the necessary tooling and scripting to prepare for our adventure: the <em>bouncing servers</em>. These are virtual hosts we set up anonymously, only connect to via Tor or a VPN, and trust to interact with our more malicious virtual machines (VMs) and store our loot.</p>
<p>These servers provide us with a reliable and stable gateway to our future attack infrastructure. To connect to a bouncing server, we would SSH into it directly after ensuring our VPN or Tor connection is established. We can initiate a Secure Shell (SSH) connection from a random machine in a cold and busy train station and find ourselves a warm and cozy environment where all our tooling and favorite Zsh aliases are waiting for us.</p>
<p>The bouncing servers can be hosted on one or many cloud providers spread across many geographical locations. The obvious limitation is the payment solution supported by these providers. Here are some examples of cloud providers with decent prices that accept cryptocurrencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>RamNode (<a href="https://www.ramnode.com/" class="LinkURL">https://www.ramnode.com/</a>) costs about $5 a month for a server with 1GB of memory and two virtual CPU (vCPU) cores. Only accepts Bitcoin.</li>
<li>NiceVPS (<a href="https://nicevps.net/" class="LinkURL">https://nicevps.net/</a>) costs about €14.99 a month for a server with 1GB of memory and one vCPU core. Accepts Monero and Zcash.</li>
<li>Cinfu (<a href="https://www.cinfu.com/" class="LinkURL">https://www.cinfu.com/</a>) costs about $4.79 a month for a server with 2GB of memory and one vCPU core. Supports Monero and Zcash.</li>
<li>PiVPS (<a href="https://pivps.com/" class="LinkURL">https://pivps.com/</a>) costs about $14.97 a month for a server with 1GB of memory and one vCPU core. Supports Monero and Zcash.</li>
<li>SecureDragon (<a href="https://securedragon.net/" class="LinkURL">https://securedragon.net/</a>) costs about $4.99 a month for a server with 1GB of memory and two vCPU cores. Only accepts Bitcoin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some services, like BitLaunch (<a href="https://bitlaunch.io/" class="LinkURL">https://bitlaunch.io/</a>), can act as a simple intermediary. BitLaunch accepts Bitcoin payments but then spawns servers on DigitalOcean and Linode using its own account (for three times the price, of course, which is downright outrageous). Another intermediary service with a slightly better deal is bithost (<a href="https://bithost.io/" class="LinkURL">https://bithost.io/</a>), which still takes a 50 percent commission. The trade-off, on top of the obvious rip-off, is neither of these providers gives you access to the DigitalOcean API, which can help automate much of the setup.</p>
<p>Choosing a cloud provider can come down to this bitter trade-off: support of cryptocurrencies and the pseudo-anonymity they grant versus ease of use and automation.</p>
<p>All major cloud providers—AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba, and so on—require a credit card before approving your account. Depending on where you live, this may not be a problem, as there are many services that provide prepaid credit cards in exchange for cash. Some online services even accept top-up credit cards with Bitcoin, but most of them will require some form of government-issued ID. That’s a risk you should carefully consider.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="8" id="Page_8"/>Ideally, bouncing servers should be used to host management tools like Terraform, Docker, and Ansible that will later help us build multiple attack infrastructures. A high-level overview of the architecture is presented in <a href="#figure1-1" id="figureanchor1-1">Figure 1-1</a>.</p>

<p>Our bouncing servers will never interact with the target. Not a single bleep. Therefore, we can afford to keep them around a little longer before switching—a few weeks or months—without incurring significant risks. Still, a dedicated investigation team might find a way to link these systems with those used to interact with the target, so deleting and re-creating bouncing servers regularly is a good idea.</p>
<h2 id="h1-501263c01-0005">The Attack Infrastructure</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Our attack infrastructure has a much higher volatility level than our bouncing servers and should be kept only a few days. It should be unique to each operation or target, if possible. The last thing we want is an investigator piecing together various clues from different targets hit by the same IP.</p>
<p>The attack infrastructure is usually composed of frontend and backend systems. The frontend system may initiate connections to the target, scan machines, and so forth. It can also be used—in the case of a reverse shell—to route incoming packets through a web proxy and deliver them, as appropriate, to the backend system, usually a C2 framework like Metasploit or Empire. Only some requests are forwarded to the C2 backend; other pages return insipid content, as depicted in <a href="#figure1-2" id="figureanchor1-2">Figure 1-2</a>.</p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure1-2">Figure 1-2</a>: Packet routing to the backend</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This packet routing can be done with a regular web proxy like Nginx or Apache that acts as a filter: requests from infected computers are routed directly to the corresponding backend C2 instance, while the remaining <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="9" id="Page_9"/>requests—from snoopy analysts, for example—are displayed an innocent web page. The backend C2 framework is really the spinal cord of the attack infrastructure, executing commands on infected machines, retrieving files, delivering exploits, and more.</p>
<p>You want your infrastructure to be modular and replaceable at will. Bypassing an IP ban should be as easy as sending one command to spawn a new proxy. Problems with the C2 backend? Enter a single command and you have a new C2 backend running with the exact same configuration.</p>
<p>Achieving this level of automation is not a whimsical way to try out the trendiest tools and programming techniques. The easier it is to spring fully configured attacking servers, the fewer mistakes we make, especially under stressful circumstances. It’s as good an excuse as any to get into the skin of a DevOps person, learn their craft, and twist it to our own needs. Hopefully, this will clue us in to some shortcomings we will later exploit in our hacking adventure. The next chapter will focus on building this backend.</p>

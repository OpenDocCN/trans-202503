<span class="blue">CHAPTER 4</span>
<br />
GAMES</strong>
</h2>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="noindent">You’ve already made some animations and stories. But in this chapter you’ll learn how to make games! You’ll make four different small games, and then you’ll use everything you’ve learned to make one big game at the end.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec26"><a id="page_98"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 12: PICK A PEACH!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The goal of this game is to find out which of the peaches on the tree is ripe! Tap a peach, and if it’s ready, it’ll fall to the ground.</p>
<p class="indent">To create this game, we’ll need to give scripts to a peach on the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec61">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, you could start all of your scripts by tapping the Green Flag button. In this activity, you will learn how to start a script by tapping a character, using the Start on Tap block. You will also see how to use the Shrink block, the Go Home block, and the Reset Characters button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec62"><a id="page_99"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the summer background and delete the cat character. You can see that the tree on the left already has some peaches on it, but these are just part of the background and they cannot move. To get a peach that will move when we tap it, we need to add it to our scene as a character.</p>
<p class="order">2. To do this, tap the plus sign in the character area and select the peach. Drag the peach onto the tree that already has three peaches on it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. We want to make the peach close to the same size as the other peaches on the tree, so tap the purple looks blocks category. Drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block to your peach’s programming area and tap it twice. The first tap will make the peach smaller, and the second tap will make it even smaller.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_100"></a>
 4. Now the peach is the right size, so you can drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block back to the blocks palette to delete it.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to show the family of starting blocks. This time, instead of using the Start on Green Flag block, we’re going to use the Start on Tap block, which brings characters to life when you tap them.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Drag the <strong>Start on Tap</strong>
 block to the programming area to start the peach’s script. Add some blue motion blocks to this triggering block to make the peach wiggle and fall from the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Try it out! Tap the peach and see what happens.</p>
<p class="indent">We need to do one more thing to make this game easier to play over and over. If you tap the peach again after it has fallen to the ground, the peach will start its script again but from the ground, not from the tree. The Start on Tap block does not return characters to their original positions like the Start on Green Flag block does.</p>
<p class="indent">You can return the peach to the tree by tapping the <strong>Reset Characters</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Reset Characters button will return all characters to their home positions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_101"></a>
 If you have other characters moving around on the stage and you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer to reset just the peach.</p>
<p class="order">8. Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec64">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_102"><a id="page_102" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb38">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>
 and <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03">3</a>
 if you need help remembering how to do this. Swap projects with a friend and complete each other’s stories by adding a new page!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb39">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec27"><a id="page_103"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_107"><a id="page_107" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_112"><a id="page_112" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_117"><a id="page_117" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb47">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3d" id="ch04lev1sec30"><a id="page_118"></a>
 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 12: PICK A PEACH!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The goal of this game is to find out which of the peaches on the tree is ripe! Tap a peach, and if it’s ready, it’ll fall to the ground.</p>
<p class="indent">To create this game, we’ll need to give scripts to a peach on the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec61">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, you could start all of your scripts by tapping the Green Flag button. In this activity, you will learn how to start a script by tapping a character, using the Start on Tap block. You will also see how to use the Shrink block, the Go Home block, and the Reset Characters button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec62"><a id="page_99"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the summer background and delete the cat character. You can see that the tree on the left already has some peaches on it, but these are just part of the background and they cannot move. To get a peach that will move when we tap it, we need to add it to our scene as a character.</p>
<p class="order">2. To do this, tap the plus sign in the character area and select the peach. Drag the peach onto the tree that already has three peaches on it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. We want to make the peach close to the same size as the other peaches on the tree, so tap the purple looks blocks category. Drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block to your peach’s programming area and tap it twice. The first tap will make the peach smaller, and the second tap will make it even smaller.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_100"></a>
 4. Now the peach is the right size, so you can drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block back to the blocks palette to delete it.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to show the family of starting blocks. This time, instead of using the Start on Green Flag block, we’re going to use the Start on Tap block, which brings characters to life when you tap them.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Drag the <strong>Start on Tap</strong>
 block to the programming area to start the peach’s script. Add some blue motion blocks to this triggering block to make the peach wiggle and fall from the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Try it out! Tap the peach and see what happens.</p>
<p class="indent">We need to do one more thing to make this game easier to play over and over. If you tap the peach again after it has fallen to the ground, the peach will start its script again but from the ground, not from the tree. The Start on Tap block does not return characters to their original positions like the Start on Green Flag block does.</p>
<p class="indent">You can return the peach to the tree by tapping the <strong>Reset Characters</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Reset Characters button will return all characters to their home positions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_101"></a>
 If you have other characters moving around on the stage and you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer to reset just the peach.</p>
<p class="order">8. Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec64">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb38">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>
 and <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03">3</a>
 if you need help remembering how to do this. Swap projects with a friend and complete each other’s stories by adding a new page!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb39">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 12: PICK A PEACH!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The goal of this game is to find out which of the peaches on the tree is ripe! Tap a peach, and if it’s ready, it’ll fall to the ground.</p>
<p class="indent">To create this game, we’ll need to give scripts to a peach on the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec61">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, you could start all of your scripts by tapping the Green Flag button. In this activity, you will learn how to start a script by tapping a character, using the Start on Tap block. You will also see how to use the Shrink block, the Go Home block, and the Reset Characters button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec62"><a id="page_99"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the summer background and delete the cat character. You can see that the tree on the left already has some peaches on it, but these are just part of the background and they cannot move. To get a peach that will move when we tap it, we need to add it to our scene as a character.</p>
<p class="order">2. To do this, tap the plus sign in the character area and select the peach. Drag the peach onto the tree that already has three peaches on it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. We want to make the peach close to the same size as the other peaches on the tree, so tap the purple looks blocks category. Drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block to your peach’s programming area and tap it twice. The first tap will make the peach smaller, and the second tap will make it even smaller.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_100"></a>
 4. Now the peach is the right size, so you can drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block back to the blocks palette to delete it.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to show the family of starting blocks. This time, instead of using the Start on Green Flag block, we’re going to use the Start on Tap block, which brings characters to life when you tap them.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Drag the <strong>Start on Tap</strong>
 block to the programming area to start the peach’s script. Add some blue motion blocks to this triggering block to make the peach wiggle and fall from the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Try it out! Tap the peach and see what happens.</p>
<p class="indent">We need to do one more thing to make this game easier to play over and over. If you tap the peach again after it has fallen to the ground, the peach will start its script again but from the ground, not from the tree. The Start on Tap block does not return characters to their original positions like the Start on Green Flag block does.</p>
<p class="indent">You can return the peach to the tree by tapping the <strong>Reset Characters</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Reset Characters button will return all characters to their home positions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_101"></a>
 If you have other characters moving around on the stage and you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer to reset just the peach.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>

<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>

 if you need help remembering how to do this. Swap projects with a friend and complete each other’s stories by adding a new page!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb39">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>

<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<p class="noindent">The goal of this game is to find out which of the peaches on the tree is ripe! Tap a peach, and if it’s ready, it’ll fall to the ground.</p>
<p class="indent">To create this game, we’ll need to give scripts to a peach on the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec61">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, you could start all of your scripts by tapping the Green Flag button. In this activity, you will learn how to start a script by tapping a character, using the Start on Tap block. You will also see how to use the Shrink block, the Go Home block, and the Reset Characters button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec62"><a id="page_99"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the summer background and delete the cat character. You can see that the tree on the left already has some peaches on it, but these are just part of the background and they cannot move. To get a peach that will move when we tap it, we need to add it to our scene as a character.</p>
<p class="order">2. To do this, tap the plus sign in the character area and select the peach. Drag the peach onto the tree that already has three peaches on it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. We want to make the peach close to the same size as the other peaches on the tree, so tap the purple looks blocks category. Drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block to your peach’s programming area and tap it twice. The first tap will make the peach smaller, and the second tap will make it even smaller.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_100"></a>
 4. Now the peach is the right size, so you can drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block back to the blocks palette to delete it.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to show the family of starting blocks. This time, instead of using the Start on Green Flag block, we’re going to use the Start on Tap block, which brings characters to life when you tap them.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Drag the <strong>Start on Tap</strong>
 block to the programming area to start the peach’s script. Add some blue motion blocks to this triggering block to make the peach wiggle and fall from the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Try it out! Tap the peach and see what happens.</p>
<p class="indent">We need to do one more thing to make this game easier to play over and over. If you tap the peach again after it has fallen to the ground, the peach will start its script again but from the ground, not from the tree. The Start on Tap block does not return characters to their original positions like the Start on Green Flag block does.</p>
<p class="indent">You can return the peach to the tree by tapping the <strong>Reset Characters</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Reset Characters button will return all characters to their home positions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_101"></a>
 If you have other characters moving around on the stage and you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer to reset just the peach.</p>
<p class="order">8. Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec64">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb47">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<p class="indent">To create this game, we’ll need to give scripts to a peach on the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec61">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, you could start all of your scripts by tapping the Green Flag button. In this activity, you will learn how to start a script by tapping a character, using the Start on Tap block. You will also see how to use the Shrink block, the Go Home block, and the Reset Characters button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec62"><a id="page_99"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the summer background and delete the cat character. You can see that the tree on the left already has some peaches on it, but these are just part of the background and they cannot move. To get a peach that will move when we tap it, we need to add it to our scene as a character.</p>
<p class="order">2. To do this, tap the plus sign in the character area and select the peach. Drag the peach onto the tree that already has three peaches on it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. We want to make the peach close to the same size as the other peaches on the tree, so tap the purple looks blocks category. Drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block to your peach’s programming area and tap it twice. The first tap will make the peach smaller, and the second tap will make it even smaller.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_100"></a>
 4. Now the peach is the right size, so you can drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block back to the blocks palette to delete it.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to show the family of starting blocks. This time, instead of using the Start on Green Flag block, we’re going to use the Start on Tap block, which brings characters to life when you tap them.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Drag the <strong>Start on Tap</strong>
 block to the programming area to start the peach’s script. Add some blue motion blocks to this triggering block to make the peach wiggle and fall from the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Try it out! Tap the peach and see what happens.</p>
<p class="indent">We need to do one more thing to make this game easier to play over and over. If you tap the peach again after it has fallen to the ground, the peach will start its script again but from the ground, not from the tree. The Start on Tap block does not return characters to their original positions like the Start on Green Flag block does.</p>
<p class="indent">You can return the peach to the tree by tapping the <strong>Reset Characters</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Reset Characters button will return all characters to their home positions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_101"></a>
 If you have other characters moving around on the stage and you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer to reset just the peach.</p>
<p class="order">8. Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec64">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb38">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>
 and <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03">3</a>
 if you need help remembering how to do this. Swap projects with a friend and complete each other’s stories by adding a new page!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb39">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>

 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, you could start all of your scripts by tapping the Green Flag button. In this activity, you will learn how to start a script by tapping a character, using the Start on Tap block. You will also see how to use the Shrink block, the Go Home block, and the Reset Characters button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec62"><a id="page_99"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the summer background and delete the cat character. You can see that the tree on the left already has some peaches on it, but these are just part of the background and they cannot move. To get a peach that will move when we tap it, we need to add it to our scene as a character.</p>
<p class="order">2. To do this, tap the plus sign in the character area and select the peach. Drag the peach onto the tree that already has three peaches on it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. We want to make the peach close to the same size as the other peaches on the tree, so tap the purple looks blocks category. Drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block to your peach’s programming area and tap it twice. The first tap will make the peach smaller, and the second tap will make it even smaller.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_100"></a>
 4. Now the peach is the right size, so you can drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block back to the blocks palette to delete it.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to show the family of starting blocks. This time, instead of using the Start on Green Flag block, we’re going to use the Start on Tap block, which brings characters to life when you tap them.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Drag the <strong>Start on Tap</strong>
 block to the programming area to start the peach’s script. Add some blue motion blocks to this triggering block to make the peach wiggle and fall from the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Try it out! Tap the peach and see what happens.</p>
<p class="indent">We need to do one more thing to make this game easier to play over and over. If you tap the peach again after it has fallen to the ground, the peach will start its script again but from the ground, not from the tree. The Start on Tap block does not return characters to their original positions like the Start on Green Flag block does.</p>
<p class="indent">You can return the peach to the tree by tapping the <strong>Reset Characters</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Reset Characters button will return all characters to their home positions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_101"></a>
 If you have other characters moving around on the stage and you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer to reset just the peach.</p>
<p class="order">8. Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec64">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb38">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>
 and <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03">3</a>
 if you need help remembering how to do this. Swap projects with a friend and complete each other’s stories by adding a new page!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb39">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>

<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb47">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>
</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">Until now, you could start all of your scripts by tapping the Green Flag button. In this activity, you will learn how to start a script by tapping a character, using the Start on Tap block. You will also see how to use the Shrink block, the Go Home block, and the Reset Characters button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec62"><a id="page_99"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the summer background and delete the cat character. You can see that the tree on the left already has some peaches on it, but these are just part of the background and they cannot move. To get a peach that will move when we tap it, we need to add it to our scene as a character.</p>
<p class="order">2. To do this, tap the plus sign in the character area and select the peach. Drag the peach onto the tree that already has three peaches on it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. We want to make the peach close to the same size as the other peaches on the tree, so tap the purple looks blocks category. Drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block to your peach’s programming area and tap it twice. The first tap will make the peach smaller, and the second tap will make it even smaller.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_100"></a>
 4. Now the peach is the right size, so you can drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block back to the blocks palette to delete it.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to show the family of starting blocks. This time, instead of using the Start on Green Flag block, we’re going to use the Start on Tap block, which brings characters to life when you tap them.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Drag the <strong>Start on Tap</strong>
 block to the programming area to start the peach’s script. Add some blue motion blocks to this triggering block to make the peach wiggle and fall from the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Try it out! Tap the peach and see what happens.</p>
<p class="indent">We need to do one more thing to make this game easier to play over and over. If you tap the peach again after it has fallen to the ground, the peach will start its script again but from the ground, not from the tree. The Start on Tap block does not return characters to their original positions like the Start on Green Flag block does.</p>
<p class="indent">You can return the peach to the tree by tapping the <strong>Reset Characters</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Reset Characters button will return all characters to their home positions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_101"></a>
 If you have other characters moving around on the stage and you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer to reset just the peach.</p>
<p class="order">8. Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec64">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb38">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>
 and <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03">3</a>
 if you need help remembering how to do this. Swap projects with a friend and complete each other’s stories by adding a new page!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb39">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>

<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>

 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb47">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec62"><a id="page_99"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the summer background and delete the cat character. You can see that the tree on the left already has some peaches on it, but these are just part of the background and they cannot move. To get a peach that will move when we tap it, we need to add it to our scene as a character.</p>
<p class="order">2. To do this, tap the plus sign in the character area and select the peach. Drag the peach onto the tree that already has three peaches on it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. We want to make the peach close to the same size as the other peaches on the tree, so tap the purple looks blocks category. Drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block to your peach’s programming area and tap it twice. The first tap will make the peach smaller, and the second tap will make it even smaller.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_100"></a>
 4. Now the peach is the right size, so you can drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block back to the blocks palette to delete it.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to show the family of starting blocks. This time, instead of using the Start on Green Flag block, we’re going to use the Start on Tap block, which brings characters to life when you tap them.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Drag the <strong>Start on Tap</strong>
 block to the programming area to start the peach’s script. Add some blue motion blocks to this triggering block to make the peach wiggle and fall from the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Try it out! Tap the peach and see what happens.</p>
<p class="indent">We need to do one more thing to make this game easier to play over and over. If you tap the peach again after it has fallen to the ground, the peach will start its script again but from the ground, not from the tree. The Start on Tap block does not return characters to their original positions like the Start on Green Flag block does.</p>
<p class="indent">You can return the peach to the tree by tapping the <strong>Reset Characters</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Reset Characters button will return all characters to their home positions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_101"></a>
 If you have other characters moving around on the stage and you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer to reset just the peach.</p>
<p class="order">8. Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec64">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb38">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>
 and <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03">3</a>
 if you need help remembering how to do this. Swap projects with a friend and complete each other’s stories by adding a new page!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb39">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb47">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>
</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="order">1. Select the summer background and delete the cat character. You can see that the tree on the left already has some peaches on it, but these are just part of the background and they cannot move. To get a peach that will move when we tap it, we need to add it to our scene as a character.</p>
<p class="order">2. To do this, tap the plus sign in the character area and select the peach. Drag the peach onto the tree that already has three peaches on it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. We want to make the peach close to the same size as the other peaches on the tree, so tap the purple looks blocks category. Drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block to your peach’s programming area and tap it twice. The first tap will make the peach smaller, and the second tap will make it even smaller.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_100"></a>
 4. Now the peach is the right size, so you can drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block back to the blocks palette to delete it.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to show the family of starting blocks. This time, instead of using the Start on Green Flag block, we’re going to use the Start on Tap block, which brings characters to life when you tap them.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Drag the <strong>Start on Tap</strong>
 block to the programming area to start the peach’s script. Add some blue motion blocks to this triggering block to make the peach wiggle and fall from the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Try it out! Tap the peach and see what happens.</p>
<p class="indent">We need to do one more thing to make this game easier to play over and over. If you tap the peach again after it has fallen to the ground, the peach will start its script again but from the ground, not from the tree. The Start on Tap block does not return characters to their original positions like the Start on Green Flag block does.</p>
<p class="indent">You can return the peach to the tree by tapping the <strong>Reset Characters</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Reset Characters button will return all characters to their home positions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_101"></a>
 If you have other characters moving around on the stage and you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer to reset just the peach.</p>
<p class="order">8. Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec64">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb38">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>
 and <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03">3</a>
 if you need help remembering how to do this. Swap projects with a friend and complete each other’s stories by adding a new page!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb39">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>

<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<p class="order">2. To do this, tap the plus sign in the character area and select the peach. Drag the peach onto the tree that already has three peaches on it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. We want to make the peach close to the same size as the other peaches on the tree, so tap the purple looks blocks category. Drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block to your peach’s programming area and tap it twice. The first tap will make the peach smaller, and the second tap will make it even smaller.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_100"></a>
 4. Now the peach is the right size, so you can drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block back to the blocks palette to delete it.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to show the family of starting blocks. This time, instead of using the Start on Green Flag block, we’re going to use the Start on Tap block, which brings characters to life when you tap them.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Drag the <strong>Start on Tap</strong>
 block to the programming area to start the peach’s script. Add some blue motion blocks to this triggering block to make the peach wiggle and fall from the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Try it out! Tap the peach and see what happens.</p>
<p class="indent">We need to do one more thing to make this game easier to play over and over. If you tap the peach again after it has fallen to the ground, the peach will start its script again but from the ground, not from the tree. The Start on Tap block does not return characters to their original positions like the Start on Green Flag block does.</p>
<p class="indent">You can return the peach to the tree by tapping the <strong>Reset Characters</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Reset Characters button will return all characters to their home positions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_101"></a>
 If you have other characters moving around on the stage and you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer to reset just the peach.</p>
<p class="order">8. Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec64">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb38">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>
 and <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03">3</a>
 if you need help remembering how to do this. Swap projects with a friend and complete each other’s stories by adding a new page!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb39">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>

 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<p class="order">3. We want to make the peach close to the same size as the other peaches on the tree, so tap the purple looks blocks category. Drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block to your peach’s programming area and tap it twice. The first tap will make the peach smaller, and the second tap will make it even smaller.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_100"></a>
 4. Now the peach is the right size, so you can drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block back to the blocks palette to delete it.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to show the family of starting blocks. This time, instead of using the Start on Green Flag block, we’re going to use the Start on Tap block, which brings characters to life when you tap them.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Drag the <strong>Start on Tap</strong>
 block to the programming area to start the peach’s script. Add some blue motion blocks to this triggering block to make the peach wiggle and fall from the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Try it out! Tap the peach and see what happens.</p>
<p class="indent">We need to do one more thing to make this game easier to play over and over. If you tap the peach again after it has fallen to the ground, the peach will start its script again but from the ground, not from the tree. The Start on Tap block does not return characters to their original positions like the Start on Green Flag block does.</p>
<p class="indent">You can return the peach to the tree by tapping the <strong>Reset Characters</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Reset Characters button will return all characters to their home positions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_101"></a>
 If you have other characters moving around on the stage and you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer to reset just the peach.</p>
<p class="order">8. Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec64">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb38">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>
 and <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03">3</a>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb39">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

 4. Now the peach is the right size, so you can drag the <strong>Shrink</strong>
 block back to the blocks palette to delete it.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to show the family of starting blocks. This time, instead of using the Start on Green Flag block, we’re going to use the Start on Tap block, which brings characters to life when you tap them.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Drag the <strong>Start on Tap</strong>
 block to the programming area to start the peach’s script. Add some blue motion blocks to this triggering block to make the peach wiggle and fall from the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Try it out! Tap the peach and see what happens.</p>
<p class="indent">We need to do one more thing to make this game easier to play over and over. If you tap the peach again after it has fallen to the ground, the peach will start its script again but from the ground, not from the tree. The Start on Tap block does not return characters to their original positions like the Start on Green Flag block does.</p>
<p class="indent">You can return the peach to the tree by tapping the <strong>Reset Characters</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Reset Characters button will return all characters to their home positions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_101"></a>
 If you have other characters moving around on the stage and you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer to reset just the peach.</p>
<p class="order">8. Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec64">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<p class="order">5. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to show the family of starting blocks. This time, instead of using the Start on Green Flag block, we’re going to use the Start on Tap block, which brings characters to life when you tap them.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Drag the <strong>Start on Tap</strong>
 block to the programming area to start the peach’s script. Add some blue motion blocks to this triggering block to make the peach wiggle and fall from the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Try it out! Tap the peach and see what happens.</p>
<p class="indent">We need to do one more thing to make this game easier to play over and over. If you tap the peach again after it has fallen to the ground, the peach will start its script again but from the ground, not from the tree. The Start on Tap block does not return characters to their original positions like the Start on Green Flag block does.</p>
<p class="indent">You can return the peach to the tree by tapping the <strong>Reset Characters</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Reset Characters button will return all characters to their home positions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_101"></a>
 If you have other characters moving around on the stage and you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer to reset just the peach.</p>
<p class="order">8. Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb47">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<p class="order">6. Drag the <strong>Start on Tap</strong>
 block to the programming area to start the peach’s script. Add some blue motion blocks to this triggering block to make the peach wiggle and fall from the tree.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Try it out! Tap the peach and see what happens.</p>
<p class="indent">We need to do one more thing to make this game easier to play over and over. If you tap the peach again after it has fallen to the ground, the peach will start its script again but from the ground, not from the tree. The Start on Tap block does not return characters to their original positions like the Start on Green Flag block does.</p>
<p class="indent">You can return the peach to the tree by tapping the <strong>Reset Characters</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Reset Characters button will return all characters to their home positions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_101"></a>
 If you have other characters moving around on the stage and you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer to reset just the peach.</p>
<p class="order">8. Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec64">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb47">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

</html>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Try it out! Tap the peach and see what happens.</p>
<p class="indent">We need to do one more thing to make this game easier to play over and over. If you tap the peach again after it has fallen to the ground, the peach will start its script again but from the ground, not from the tree. The Start on Tap block does not return characters to their original positions like the Start on Green Flag block does.</p>
<p class="indent">You can return the peach to the tree by tapping the <strong>Reset Characters</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Reset Characters button will return all characters to their home positions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_101"></a>
 If you have other characters moving around on the stage and you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer to reset just the peach.</p>
<p class="order">8. Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec64">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb38">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>
 and <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03">3</a>
 if you need help remembering how to do this. Swap projects with a friend and complete each other’s stories by adding a new page!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb39">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>

<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters.

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb47">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>
</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">We need to do one more thing to make this game easier to play over and over. If you tap the peach again after it has fallen to the ground, the peach will start its script again but from the ground, not from the tree. The Start on Tap block does not return characters to their original positions like the Start on Green Flag block does.</p>
<p class="indent">You can return the peach to the tree by tapping the <strong>Reset Characters</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Reset Characters button will return all characters to their home positions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_101"></a>
 If you have other characters moving around on the stage and you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer to reset just the peach.</p>
<p class="order">8. Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec64">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb38">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>
 and <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03">3</a>
 if you need help remembering how to do this. Swap projects with a friend and complete each other’s stories by adding a new page!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb39">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>
</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">You can return the peach to the tree by tapping the <strong>Reset Characters</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Reset Characters button will return all characters to their home positions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_101"></a>
 If you have other characters moving around on the stage and you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer to reset just the peach.</p>
<p class="order">8. Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec64">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb38">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>
 and <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03">3</a>
 if you need help remembering how to do this. Swap projects with a friend and complete each other’s stories by adding a new page!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb39">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>

<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

 If you have other characters moving around on the stage and you want only the peach to return home, then you might prefer to reset just the peach.</p>
<p class="order">8. Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb38">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb47">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<p class="order">8. Tap the blue motion blocks category to find the Go Home block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec64">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb38">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>
 and <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03">3</a>
 if you need help remembering how to do this. Swap projects with a friend and complete each other’s stories by adding a new page!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb39">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb47">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<p class="order">9. Drag the <strong>Go Home</strong>
 block to the end of the peach’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec64">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb38">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>
 and <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03">3</a>
 if you need help remembering how to do this. Swap projects with a friend and complete each other’s stories by adding a new page!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb39">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<p class="indent">Now the peach will hop back up onto the tree after it has fallen, and you can play the game again!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec63">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You might want the script to pause for a couple of seconds before it reaches the Go Home block so that the peach doesn’t jump straight back up onto the tree as soon as it falls. Use the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to make the peach stay on the ground for a moment.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec64">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_102"><a id="page_102" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb38">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>
 and <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03">3</a>
 if you need help remembering how to do this. Swap projects with a friend and complete each other’s stories by adding a new page!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb39">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec27"><a id="page_103"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>

<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>

<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>

<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>

</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>

If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb47">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>

<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>

 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb47">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">To make the game more interesting, you could add more peaches to the tree. Can you make it so that some of the fruit is not ripe enough to fall yet? If the fruit is not ripe, maybe it just wiggles on the tree and stays put.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb38">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>
 and <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03">3</a>
 if you need help remembering how to do this. Swap projects with a friend and complete each other’s stories by adding a new page!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb39">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPOSING AND COMPARING SHAPES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have made a falling peach, try creating different types of fruits. What shapes do you use? Which fruits are the biggest? Use descriptive words to compare and contrast the various shapes and sizes you used.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING TO THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Add another character to this scene and create the first page of a story! How do the characters react to the falling fruit? Are they surprised? Hungry? Use speech bubbles, sound recordings, and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to incorporate speaking and words into your story. You can look back at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapters 2</a>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb40">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is sometimes difficult for young children to tap a character lightly and evenly enough for ScratchJr to interpret the motion as a tap and not a drag. If ScratchJr thinks the motion is a drag, it will move the peach slightly instead of running the script. If the peach does not wiggle and fall from the tree when the child taps it, that’s the likely cause.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>

<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 13: BLAST OFF!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, the cat counts down, and then a rocket ship blasts off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec65">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters.

 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up?

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">

</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>

<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>
</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to get the characters to work together, using the Send Message and Start on Message blocks. The cat will count down the seconds, and then the rocket will blast off!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec66">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>

 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

</html>
<p class="order">1. Start by adding the moon background and the rocket character.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>

 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>
</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="order">2. Let’s write the script for the cat first. Tap the cat to return to it. Drag a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_104"></a>
 3. Tap the purple looks blocks category and add three <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks to make the cat count “3, 2, 1.”</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the yellow triggering blocks category to find the Send Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>

<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>

<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>

 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off.

 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>

<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>
</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Drag the <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block down to the programming area and snap it onto the end of the cat’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. This script will run when another script sends a message.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_105"></a>
 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<p class="orderi">This will tell the rocket when to start. When the cat has finished counting, it will send a message for the rocket to receive.</p>
<p class="order">6. Now, let’s tap the rocket and give it a script. We want to make the rocket ship blast off when it receives the message from the cat. Start the script with the <strong>Start on Message</strong>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off.

 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>

 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>

 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

 7. After the Start on Message block, add a <strong>Move Up</strong>
 block to make the rocket move up the screen as if it is taking off, and then add a <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the rocket disappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to try out the script.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec67">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec68"><a id="page_106"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

</h4>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>

<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up?

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>

 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>
</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">This script uses an orange message. You can choose from six different message colors to communicate between characters in your project. Just keep in mind that your Send Message block has to match the color of your Start on Message block. For example, an orange Send Message block will trigger a script that begins with an orange Start on Message block, but if you have used a purple Send Message block in your project instead, the script that begins with an orange Start on Message block will never run!</p>
<div class="image"></div>

<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>

<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters.

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb47">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>
</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">Add some more characters and start each of their scripts with a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 block. You could have a crowd of characters cheer together when the rocket blasts off by giving them all the same color Start on Message block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that all scripts that begin with a Start on Message block of the same color will start at the same time when a Send Message block of that color is used.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb41">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<p class="indent">Maybe you could have a shooting star fly across the sky as the rocket is rising. Would it start with the same color message as the crowd?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>

 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: WRITING THE GAME DIRECTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">How does the player know the rules of the game? Write step-by-step instructions for the player using <strong>Say</strong>
 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: GETTING READY FOR TAKEOFF</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the countdown begins, program the cat to make an announcement about what is going to happen. Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to prepare for the rocket’s takeoff. Where is the rocket going? When will it take off?</p>
<p class="indent">Add another page after the blastoff to show where the rocket travels!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb42">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING BACKWARD</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice counting backward! Your cat is counting down the amount of time until the rocket ship will take off into space. When your cat reaches “1,” the rocket ship will blast off. After programming the cat to count down from 3, try making it count down from 10, 15, and even 20!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb43">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can explain the Send Message block as an announcement that one character makes to all of the other characters. Only the characters with a Start on Message block of the same color as the announcement will listen for the announcement and react to it. The rest of the characters will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec28"><a id="page_108"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 14: PLAY TAG!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Program the cat and the dog to play tag. In this game, the dog’s script will start when it is tagged by the cat. Then the dog will tag the cat, and they’ll continue to play tag until you stop the program.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>

<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">

</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>

 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>

<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec69">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity you’ll learn how to use another new starting block: the Start on Bump block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb50">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>

<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The Start on Bump block starts a character’s script when the character bumps into another character.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec70"><a id="page_109"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>

<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>

 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>
</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="order">1. Select the farm background and add the dog. Position the cat and the dog on the stage so that they are standing about five steps apart. You can move them later on if those positions aren’t quite right when you try out your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The cat will move toward the dog and say “Tag!” Then it will move back and pause for 2 seconds to wait for the dog to tag it. We’ll add a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block to the cat’s script so the cat and the dog will play again and again.</p>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

 blocks or the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button. Can you give the players hints if they can’t find the correct animal?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>

 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb51">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>
</p>
</div>

</html>
<p class="order">2. Create the following script for the cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_110"></a>
 3. The dog’s script uses the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block so that it starts when the dog is bumped by the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<p class="orderi">After the dog is bumped, it will wait 2 seconds to give the cat a chance to run away. Then the dog will move to the cat, say “Tag!” and run away.</p>
<p class="order">4. Create the following script for the dog:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">We don’t need the Repeat Forever block for the dog, because the Start on Bump block will run every time the dog is tagged.</p>
<p class="order">5. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to watch your characters play tag! Press the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button when you want the game to end.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec71">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec72"><a id="page_111"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec29"><a id="page_113"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb49">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a character is touching another character that has a Start on Bump script, the script will keep running until the characters are not touching anymore. For example, if you move the cat so close to the dog that they are touching, the dog’s Start on Bump script will begin running, and it will continue to run over and over again until you move the cat away from the dog.</p>

<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>

 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>

<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>

<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>

 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb48">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>
<p class="indent">Switch worksheets with a friend and answer each other’s math problems! Don’t forget to make an answer sheet and mark each other’s answers.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>

 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>

<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead.

Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: WRITING YOUR OWN MATH PROBLEMS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The game you’ve created has a lot of different motion blocks and Wait blocks. Can you come up with a math problem worksheet for this game? You could write problems like “How many movements does the pig make?” or “Who is waiting the longest?”</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>

 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<p class="noindent">See if you can make a game of dodgeball. Add a ball to your project and make it move all around the stage with a few different <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 scripts that repeat forever. (See “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev2sec38">Looking for a Challenge?</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_56">page 56</a>
 to see how to use two scripts together in the same programming area.) Change the scripts of the cat and the dog so that when they are hit by the ball, they say “I’m out!” and then disappear. Add more characters to make the game more exciting!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can get your characters to talk and perform actions at the same time by using two scripts in the same programming area. Decide which scripts should start with a Start on Bump block and which ones should start with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TURNING YOUR GAME INTO A STORY</strong>

<p class="noindent">Turn your game into a story! Make an introductory page explaining why the bird wants to reach the mushroom. Is there something special about this mushroom?</p>
<p class="indent">The second page can be the game, and the third page can be the ending to the story and a message to the player. For example, you might write something like “Congratulations, you reached the mushroom!”</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: KEEPING A TALLY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Get some friends to play this game with you. Keep a tally of the number of wins and losses for each person, and add them up once everyone has had the chance to play the same number of times. Did each player get a different result, or did every player have the same outcome?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb52">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb44">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A CONVERSATION BETWEEN FRIENDS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to get your cat and dog to talk to each other while they play. Use phrases like “I’m going to tag you!” and “You’re it!” in the conversation, using capital letters and punctuation marks when needed. How does the game of tag end? Does someone give up? Remember to use the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 and <strong>Wait</strong>
 blocks to help time the conversation so it makes sense with the way the characters are moving.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb45">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ESTIMATING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">To program the perfect game of tag, you will need to estimate what numbers to use on the Wait blocks and how many blue motion blocks you need. Try different numbers and test them out to see what works best with your program!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb46">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">This activity repeats using a combination of the <strong>Repeat Forever</strong>
 block and the <strong>Start on Bump</strong>
 block. While it might seem like a good idea to give the cat a script that has a Start on Bump block just like the dog, this approach won’t work!</p>
<p class="indent">If both characters have a Start on Bump block, they’ll both be triggered at the same time. It doesn’t matter which one is moving or which one is stationary when they “bump” into each other. The block will be triggered, and they won’t bump again.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 15: GUESS THE ODD ONE OUT!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec73">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>

<p class="noindent">Create a two-player guessing game to play with your friends and family. In this game, all of the animals are moving in a pattern, but one of them is moving slightly differently than the others. Each player takes turns guessing which animal is the odd one out. If the player chooses the wrong one, the animal will say, “Not I!” If the player guesses right, the animal will say, “You got it!” The first player to tap the correct animal wins.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn three new things in this activity: how to use the Stop block, how to run a project in Presentation Mode, and how to use different triggering blocks to start different actions for the same character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec74"><a id="page_114"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>

 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>

 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Pick a background. Your animals will need lots of space, so the farm background would be one good choice.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add four animals to join the cat on the stage. You’ll program four of the five animals to move in the same way and one of them to move differently.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Make a script for one animal to have it move around in a square. Add another script that makes it say “Not I!” when it is tapped.</p>
<p class="order">4. Make the same scripts for three other animals so that four of the animals have the exact same scripts.</p>
<p class="orderi">Note that instead of making a new script for each of the animals, you can copy a script from one animal to another by simply dragging the script from the programming area to the animal in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_115"></a>
 5. Change the time on each script’s <strong>Wait</strong>
 block so that the animals will start moving at different times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re finished programming the animals, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to hide the programming area so that no one accidentally sees the answer in the script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"></a>
 The stage will fill the entire screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now you have a game! Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button to get it started, and see who can find the odd one out first.</p>
<p class="order">9. Tap the <strong>Exit Presentation Mode</strong>
 button to return to the regular ScratchJr screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec75">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the winning animal is tapped, it stops moving. See if you can make all of the other animals also stop moving when the game is won. You will have to use a <strong>Send Message</strong>
 block and give each of the other animals a <strong>Start on Message</strong>
 script that stops its motion.</p>

</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>

<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">

<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead.

Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>

<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>

<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<p class="order">6. Add a script for the odd-one-out animal with an extra <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to make the animal move slightly differently than the others. Then give it another script so that it stops and says “You’re right!” when it is tapped. To make the animal stop moving when it’s tapped, tap the orange control blocks category and drag a <strong>Stop</strong>
 block to the end of the animal’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>

</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

<p class="noindent">The Stop block will stop the scripts for only the character that has the Stop block, not for any of the other characters. Once a script is stopped, you can restart it with the appropriate trigger (tapping the Green Flag, tapping the character, sending a message, and so on).</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! CATS VERSUS BIRDS</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Okay, you’ve learned a lot, so now let’s make a really cool game. We’ll make a one-player game where the bird must fly past three moving cats and touch the mushroom to win.</p>
<p class="indent">When the player taps the bird, it flies toward the mushroom, but if the bird touches any of the cats on the way, it has to go back to its starting position. If the bird reaches the mushroom safely, the player wins!</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec76">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose a background for your game. The savannah is a good option because it has lots of sky for the bird to fly in.</p>
<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>

<p class="order">7. To play the game, tap the <strong>Enter Presentation Mode</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

<p class="order">2. Add a mushroom to your project and drag it to the right side of the stage. Then add a bird and drag it to the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Now add two more cats and line them up in the middle of the stage so that they are not touching any of the other characters.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_119"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">4. Program the cats to move upward at different speeds by changing the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block so it is different for each cat. You need to make another script to send an orange message when a cat is bumped by the bird so that the bird will know it has to go back to the start. Here is an example of our script for one cat:</p>

<p class="order"><a id="page_120"></a>
 5. Program the bird to move forward when it is tapped. Then add a script to make it go back to its home position when an orange message is sent because it bumped into a cat:</p>

<p class="order">6. Program the mushroom to say “You win!” when it is bumped by the bird:</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"></a>
 You’ve just made a game that uses all the skills you learned in this chapter! When you play, your aim is to time the movement of the bird just right so that it dodges the moving cats and reaches the mushroom. Good luck!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec77">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec78">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Change the starting positions and speeds of the cats to make the game harder. What other strategies can you use to make this game easier or more difficult?</p>

<p class="noindent">Make sure that the cats don’t touch one another or the mushroom when they move around the screen. Bumps between any characters will send the bird back to the start, since the Start on Bump scripts are triggered by any bump, not just bumps from the bird.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When trying to tap the bird, a child may sometimes drag the bird instead. This will reset the home position of the bird to that new location, which may be in the middle of the screen. Then, when the bird bumps into a cat and returns to its home position, it will no longer go back to the edge of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid this problem, add another character to the project—a star, for example—to act as a button; to make the bird move, you only have to tap this star. Place the star in the bottom corner of the stage where it will not touch any of the other characters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123" style=";color:black;"></a>
 The star should send a blue message when it is tapped, like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Change the bird’s scripts so that it no longer moves forward when tapped. Instead, it moves forward when it receives the blue message from the star.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If the child drags the star while trying to tap it, that isn’t a problem. The home position of the bird will stay the same, and the game can carry on.<a id="page_124" style=";color:black;"></a>

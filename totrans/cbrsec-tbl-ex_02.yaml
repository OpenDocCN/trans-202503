    were invented. It isn’t hard to imagine that military generals of the past conducted
    them to discuss hypothetical attacks, troop movements, and defenses. More recently,
    tabletop exercises have prepared people for pandemics, natural disasters, nuclear

    Broadly, a *cybersecurity tabletop exercise* is a conversation between those responsible
    for fulfilling a variety of roles during a cybersecurity incident. In the exercise,
    the participants, representing a range of organizational interests, walk through
    a hypothetical scenario and discuss how they would respond to it. With the right
    planning, cybersecurity tabletop exercises can be an effective, engaging, and
    relatively low-cost way to prepare an organization’s information assurance program
    for the inevitable cybersecurity incident. In this chapter, we consider why an
    organization might choose to conduct a tabletop exercise, how it can benefit from
    doing so, and what advantages these exercises have over other approaches.

    it takes approximately 206 days to detect a data breach. (You can find its report,
    titled “ENISA Threat Landscape 2020 - Data Breach,” at [*https://<wbr>www<wbr>.enisa<wbr>.europa<wbr>.eu<wbr>/publications<wbr>/enisa<wbr>-threat<wbr>-landscape<wbr>-2020<wbr>-data<wbr>-breach*](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2020-data-breach).)
    This is in line with the Ponemon Institute and IBM Security’s finding that, in
    2023, it took an average of 204 days to identify a data breach and another 73
    days to contain it. A tabletop exercise takes an event that would normally require
    significant time to identify—and even more time to resolve—and compresses the
    discussion down to a few hours. When a discussion point is brought up that may
    require hours or days of work, the facilitator of the exercise can artificially
    “move the clock ahead” and provide the next block of information to consider,
    filling in any information gaps. We discuss these strategies further in [Chapter

    that also evolve. Factors completely independent of traditional cybersecurity,

    the threat landscape, as was the case during the COVID-19 pandemic when many workforces

    provides excellent guidance on what should be included in this plan. One critical
    component is a *charter*, which defines what an incident is and includes the mission
    statement, goals and objectives, and authority of the team. The plan should also
    define the members of the incident response team, their roles and responsibilities,
    and the incident severity levels set by the organization. It should spell out
    an organized incident response approach and communication protocols.

    data breach notification laws in 2002, and all 50 states now have their own variations.
    In the European Union, the GDPR legislation codifies, among other things, data
    breach notification rules. Other countries have followed suit, including Australia,
    China, and even Barbados (as noted earlier in the chapter).

    its own notification process. Perhaps most importantly, some define slightly different
    temporal requirements and thresholds at which a notification is required. For
    example, one data breach law may require notification to an authority within 72
    hours of a *suspected* compromise of a data set, while another may allow seven

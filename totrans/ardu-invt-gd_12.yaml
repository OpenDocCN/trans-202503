    As its name states, it is a meter capable of measuring multiple things related
    to electricity—namely, current, continuity, resistance, and voltage. Let’s take
    a look at how to use a multimeter. We will be using the SparkFun VC830L (TOL-12966;
    shown in [Figure A-1](app01.xhtml#app01fig01)) throughout the tutorial, but these
    methods should apply to most multimeters.

    knob allows the user to set the multimeter to read different things such as milliamps
    (mA) of current, voltage (V), and resistance (Ω). The numbers along the outside
    of the selection knob indicate the maximum value or range for any given setting.

    is assumed that the values displayed have the same units as the setting, so if
    you have the range set to 200 Ω, the number displayed will be in Ω. If you have
    the range set to 2 kΩ, 20 kΩ, or 200 kΩ, then the value displayed will be in units
    of kΩ.

    ports on the front of the unit. The three ports are labeled COM, mAVΩ, and 10A.
    COM stands for *common* and should almost always be connected to ground, negative,
    or the – of a circuit. The mAVΩ port allows the measurement of current (up to
    200 mA), voltage (V), and resistance (Ω). The 10A port is the special connection
    used for measuring currents greater than 200 mA.

    and debugging circuits. This feature allows us to test for conductivity and to
    trace where electrical connections have been made or not made. Set the multimeter
    to the continuity setting, marked with a diode symbol with propagation waves around
    it (like sound coming from a speaker), though this may vary among multimeters.

- en: Touch the two probe ends together and you should hear a ringing tone—this is
    why checking for continuity is sometimes called “ringing out” a circuit. You can
    use this method to test which holes on a solderless breadboard are connected and
    which ones aren’t. The probe tips are usually too big to insert directly into
    a breadboard, but you can stick two wires in the same row on a breadboard and
    touch the ends of the probes to each wire. You should hear the tone indicating
    that these two wires are connected through the row. You can also use this method
    to trace out a circuit. Because you often can’t see where all of the wires go,
    this is a quick way to test whether two points are connected electrically. When
    you’re checking for continuity, it doesn’t matter which side of the probe you
    connect, because you’re just checking that one side is connected electrically
    to the other.

    get an actual value for the resistance, you need to use a resistance setting.
    Turn the knob to one of the resistance settings marked by the omega symbol (Ω),
    which represents *ohms,* the unit for measuring resistance. Make sure that the
    resistor or the element you’re measuring is not powered or connected to your circuit.
    A resistor, like many electrical elements, has two ends. To measure its resistance,
    simply touch the ends of the probes to the ends of the resistor. As with continuity,
    it doesn’t matter which side you connect to red and which side you connect to
    black.

    for an iron is about 650 degrees Fahrenheit. If it’s too hot, the tip will oxidize
    and get dirty quickly. If it’s not hot enough, it won’t melt the solder. An adjustable
    iron will help you control this, so it’s worth spending a little extra.

    iron directly to the solder to melt it. The trick is to hold the iron to the components
    you’re intending to solder for around 2 to 3 seconds. Then you apply solder directly
    to the heated joint, and the solder will melt. Solder will always flow toward
    the heat and settle in the hottest part of the component. If you feed the solder
    directly onto the iron, it may glob up on the iron and not go onto the parts you
    want to solder. If this happens, simply clean the iron and try again. Hold the
    iron the same way you would hold a pencil, with your dominant hand, holding it
    from the handle. With your other hand, hold a length of solder. Be careful not
    to hold the solder too close to the end you’re melting, as the heat may travel
    up the length of solder to your fingertips.

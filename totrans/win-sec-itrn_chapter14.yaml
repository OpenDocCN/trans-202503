- en: As its primary function, Kerberos distributes *tickets*, each of which represents
    a user’s verified identity. The system can use this identity to determine whether
    the user can access a service, such as a file server. For example, if the user
    sends their ticket in a request to open a file, the file server can check its
    validity, then decide whether to grant the user access through something like
    an access check.

    network and allowing the tickets to be verified. It does this by using shared
    encryption keys, commonly derived from a user’s password, to encrypt and verify
    the tickets. The Active Directory server never stores the password in plaintext;
    it stores only the encryption key.

    key based on the user’s password and a salt ❶. It generates the salt based on
    values, such as the username and realm, that depend on the type of encryption
    algorithm in use. We use the term *realm* to describe the scope of the Kerberos
    authentication. In Windows, the realm is the DNS name for the domain that contains
    the user, such as *mineral.local*. We can combine the username and the realm to
    form a user principal name, commonly written with an at symbol (@), as in *user@mineral.local*.
  id: totrans-14

    and sends it over the network to the authentication server ❷. The authentication
    server is the part of the KDC that is responsible for issuing an initial ticket
    to the authentication process. The AS-REQ message contains the username and realm
    as well as *pre-authentication data*, which consists of the current time encrypted
    with the user’s shared encryption key. The authentication server can look up the
    shared key from its key database using the specified username and realm, then
    use the key to decrypt the pre-authentication data ❸. If it succeeds, it has verified
    that the data has come from the user, as only the server and the client should
    know the shared encryption key.
  id: totrans-15

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The authentication server then generates a *ticket granting ticket (TGT)*, which
    it encrypts with the shared encryption key for a special user, *krbtgt*. The authenticating
    user doesn’t know the *krbtgt* user’s shared key, so they can’t decrypt the ticket.
    While the TGT has a special name, it’s essentially just a ticket that verifies
    the user’s identity to the *ticket granting server (TGS)*, which is responsible
    for issuing tickets for the user to authenticate to a network service. The ticket
    contains details about the user’s identity encoded in a *privilege attribute certificate
    (PAC)*, as well as a randomly generated session key for the TGS to use. We’ll
    see an example of a PAC in “Decrypting the AP-REQ Message” on page 469.

    with the user’s shared encryption key. This value, when decrypted, contains details
    about the ticket, such as how long it’s valid for. Eventually, a ticket expires,
    and the user will need to request a new TGT. This second value also contains the
    session encryption key, encrypted in the ticket. The authentication server packages
    the encrypted ticket and ticket information into the *authentication service reply
    (AS-REP)* message and sends it back to the client LSA ❹. [Figure 14-2](chapter14.xhtml#fig14-2)

    encrypted data value. This additional encrypted value is called the *authenticator*.
    The TGT, SPN, and authenticator are packaged up in a *ticket granting service
    request (TGS-REQ)* message and sent to the TGS. [Figure 14-3](chapter14.xhtml#fig14-3)

    weren’t allowed to authenticate to the domain or service).

    and verify that the hash matches the associated information. This process ensures
    that only a user with access to the shared encryption key could have extracted
    the session key from the AS-REP and encrypted the contents of the authenticator
    for this TGT. The TGS then verifies that the timestamp is recent. Typically, it
    will reject the request if the timestamp is older than five minutes. For this
    reason, it’s crucial to Kerberos authentication that the client and server systems
    have synchronized clocks. The TGS also checks that it hasn’t already seen the
    ticket’s sequence number. This check counters replay attacks, in which the same
    TGS-REQ is sent multiple times.

    Active Directory usually just maps these SPNs to a user or computer account. For
    example, the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">HOST/graphite.mineral.local</samp>

    SPN. If the SPN doesn’t exist or the user isn’t allowed to use the service, it

    This key encrypts a *referral ticket*, which contains the user’s information and
    the requested service, and returns it to the client ❷. The client then forwards
    the referral ticket to the TGS in the *SALES* domain ❸. As the ticket is encrypted

    contents.

    This is useful because, when a user connects to a service using Kerberos, they
    do not provide it with their credentials. Instead, they provide a ticket that
    has been encrypted using the server’s shared encryption key. The service could
    try forwarding the ticket on to another service, but as it won’t know the new
    service’s shared encryption key it won’t be able to encrypt the ticket, so the
    new service won’t accept it.'
  id: totrans-164
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The only way to get an encrypted ticket for a new service might seem to be to
    send a TGS-REQ message to the TGS using a TGT. However, the original service only
    has a TGT for its own account, not for the user, and without the user’s TGT a
    service can’t forward a user’s credentials further than specified. This behavior
    provides an important security measure; if any authentication a user made to a
    service could be delegated to another service, it would likely be easy to get
    full administrator access to the domain.
  id: totrans-165
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That said, forwarding credentials is a useful feature. For example, let’s say
    you have a corporate network that users can access only from an external network,
    via a web server. It would be useful if the web server could provide the users’
    credentials to access the backend systems, such as a database server. One way
    of solving this issue would be for the web server to request the user’s plaintext
    credentials and then use those to authenticate to the domain, which would then
    provide the user’s TGT. In practice, though, this is a terrible idea for security.
  id: totrans-166

    a defined delegation process. A client can opt in to delegation, allowing a target
    service to use their identity to request tickets for other network services on
    their behalf. Windows domains configure delegation on a per-account basis for
    both users and computers. In the GUI, you’ll see the delegation dialog shown in
    [Figure 14-7](chapter14.xhtml#fig14-7) when inspecting the properties of an account.

    For example, what if the user accessing the HTTP service is on a public network
    and cannot directly connect to the KDC to get a service ticket? This is where
    the second type of constrained delegation—protocol transition delegation, referred
    to as *Service for User to Self (S4U2self)* in the documentation—might be useful.
    It performs an *authentication protocol transition*, meaning that the frontend
    HTTP service can authenticate using its own authentication mechanism, then use
    that information to construct a service ticket for the database service with the
    user’s domain credentials, without requiring the user to know about Kerberos.

    send the ticket to the destination service to authenticate to it directly. However,
    we don’t have the extracted session key needed to encrypt the authentication data
    in a valid AP-REQ either, so we’ll need to call the SSPI to generate the AP-REQ
    based on the cached ticket.

- en: One potential reason to interact with the ticket cache is to get a ticket for
    Kerberoasting, an attack described in the “Silver Tickets and Kerberoasting” box
    on page 465. However, you don’t need to query the cache for this attack, as you
    can find all the information you need using the SSPI APIs. Let’s walk through
    a simple example so that you can understand how the Kerberoasting process works.
    First, in [Listing 14-33](chapter14.xhtml#Lis14-33), we query for all user accounts
    with configured SPNs.

    password that will be difficult to brute-force (any computer account with an SPN
    configured also has an automatically configured complex password). We’ll try to
    brute-force the password for the *sqlserver* user. First we need to make a request
    for its SPN and receive the ticket ([Listing 14-34](chapter14.xhtml#Lis14-34)).

    We can then try to decrypt the ticket with each key until we find a key that works,
    as illustrated in [Listing 14-35](chapter14.xhtml#Lis14-35).

    property ❶. If it was decrypted, we then print the password to the console. In
    this case, we find that the password for the *sqlserver* user is <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">DBPassw0rd</samp>—
    probably not the most secure option! Note that this example script isn’t very
    efficient or fast. It’s made easier by the ticket being encrypted with the RC4
    encryption algorithm; you could apply the same technique to AES, but the brute-forcing
    attempt will take longer, as AES key derivation is more complex.

    for Windows domain authentication since Windows 2000\. We examined the key distribution
    center implemented on the Windows domain controller, which holds the list of keys
    associated with all users and computers on a network, and saw how Kerberos uses
    these keys (typically derived from the account password) to authenticate tickets,
    which can then authenticate to services on the network.

    of credentials. We discussed this topic at length, including both constrained
    and unconstrained delegation as well as the associated Service for User mechanisms.
    We finished the chapter with a description of user-to-user authentication, which
    allows for two users to authenticate to each other without needing to register
    an SPN with the domain.

- en: Welcome to *Electronics for Kids*! This book will teach you how to make cool
    things by putting together the same parts that are inside televisions, electronic
    toys, radios, and all the other gadgets in the world. You’ll build fun experiments,
    like a light powered by lemons, as well as useful (but still fun) projects, like
    an intruder alarm and a musical instrument.

    your own inventions by combining the components in different ways. Blinking a
    light is one of the first things I learned how to do with electronics. When I
    saw how that worked, a whole new world suddenly opened up to me. Since then, I’ve
    built robots, music players, miniature computers, and even a device that lets
    you see through a wall! With practice, you can build those things, too—and this
    book will teach you the basic skills you need to start the journey.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I was about 14 years old, I thought computers were cool, but I had no idea
    how they worked. They seemed magical, and I thought I’d never understand them
    or be able to build one. Luckily, my dad was an engineer, and he had a very good
    way of explaining things. When I asked questions, he showed me not only how things
    worked but also how I could build something similar myself.

- en: If you’ve ever looked at an electronic gadget and thought, “How does that work?”
    or “How can I make that?” as I did, then you’re in the right place. Whether you’re
    8 or 100 years old, as long as you’re curious and have a playful spirit, this
    book is for you.

    and skills covered in previous chapters.
  prefs: []

- en: Each chapter has at least one hands-on project. Build these projects! Electronics
    is a very practical skill, and reading about how a component works or what a project
    should do is different from experiencing it yourself. Just be sure to read a project
    in full before you dive into it so you understand the steps involved.

    to everyone at some point when working with electronics—even me. Just keep at
    it, study your circuit, and rewire the whole project if needed to get it working.
    When you’ve been battling to get a circuit working for a couple of hours, then
    suddenly find the error and your circuit works, you’ll feel amazing! If you get
    stuck, grab a friend or family member and ask them to help out.'

    starting with basic—but essential—information and simple circuits. After the basics,
    you’ll build more complex circuits and meet components like resistors, capacitors,
    transistors, and integrated circuits. To see how the components work and to understand
    electronics in a practical way, you’ll build fun projects in every chapter.

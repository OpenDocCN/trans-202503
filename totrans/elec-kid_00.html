<h2 class="h2" id="ch00"><span class="yellow">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Welcome to <em>Electronics for Kids</em>! This book will teach you how to make cool things by putting together the same parts that are inside televisions, electronic toys, radios, and all the other gadgets in the world. You’ll build fun experiments, like a light powered by lemons, as well as useful (but still fun) projects, like an intruder alarm and a musical instrument.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentt"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiv"/>You’ll do more than just follow directions, however: you’ll also learn how every component in each project works.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">My hope is that when you know how those components work, you’ll see how to create your own inventions by combining the components in different ways. Blinking a light is one of the first things I learned how to do with electronics. When I saw how that worked, a whole new world suddenly opened up to me. Since then, I’ve built robots, music players, miniature computers, and even a device that lets you see through a wall! With practice, you can build those things, too—and this book will teach you the basic skills you need to start the journey.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec01"><span class="green">ABOUT THIS BOOK</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When I was about 14 years old, I thought computers were cool, but I had no idea how they worked. They seemed magical, and I thought I’d never understand them or be able to build one. Luckily, my dad was an engineer, and he had a very good way of explaining things. When I asked questions, he showed me not only how things worked but also how I could build something similar myself.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I wrote this as the book I would have loved to have had as a kid, and I hope you enjoy it!</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec01"><span class="green">Who Should Read This Book</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If you’ve ever looked at an electronic gadget and thought, “How does that work?” or “How can I make that?” as I did, then you’re in the right place. Whether you’re 8 or 100 years old, as long as you’re curious and have a playful spirit, this book is for you.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec02"><span class="green">How to Read This Book</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">I recommend you read this book in order, because every chapter builds upon concepts and skills covered in previous chapters.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Each chapter has at least one hands-on project. Build these projects! Electronics is a very practical skill, and reading about how a component works or what a project should do is different from experiencing it yourself. Just be sure to read <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxv"/>a project in full before you dive into it so you understand the steps involved.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you encounter problems as you build a project, don’t worry: that happens to everyone at some point when working with electronics—even me. Just keep at it, study your circuit, and rewire the whole project if needed to get it working. When you’ve been battling to get a circuit working for a couple of hours, then suddenly find the error and your circuit works, you’ll feel amazing! If you get stuck, grab a friend or family member and ask them to help out.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If there are parts of the book you don’t understand right away, I recommend you keep on reading. Don’t let details stop you. Come back to that particular topic later when you have some more projects under your belt.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec03"><span class="green">What’s in This Book?</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">As you work through this book, you’ll build your knowledge of electronics gradually, starting with basic—but essential—information and simple circuits. After the basics, you’ll build more complex circuits and meet components like resistors, capacitors, transistors, and integrated circuits. To see how the components work and to understand electronics in a practical way, you’ll build fun projects in every chapter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">At the end of the book, you’ll build one final, epic project: a game to play with your friends. By then, you’ll have enough experience and knowledge to modify the game or even build a totally new game you invent yourself!</p>&#13;
<p class="indentb">This book is divided into three parts. <strong><a href="part01.xhtml#part01">Part 1: Playing with Electricity</a></strong> is the foundation for the rest of the book. It’s all about fundamental knowledge and how electricity actually works.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> <strong><a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1: What Is Electricity?</a></strong> introduces the science behind electricity and describes the basic requirements for a circuit to turn something on.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> <strong><a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2: Making Things Move with Electricity and Magnets</a></strong> shows you how you can move objects with electricity. In this chapter, you’ll build a motor from scratch.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxvi"/><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> <strong><a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3: How to Generate Electricity</a></strong> describes how batteries and power plugs in the wall provide electricity. Of course, you’ll build your own electricity sources, too!</p>&#13;
<p class="noindenttb"><strong><a href="part02.xhtml#part02">Part 2: Building Circuits</a></strong> is where you’ll really get your hands dirty. You’ll meet some of the most important components in electronics, and you’ll learn how to build both permanent and temporary circuits.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> In <strong><a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4: Creating Light with LEDs</a></strong>, you’ll build circuits on a breadboard for the first time to create a <em>prototype</em>, which is just a temporary circuit. You’ll learn about resistors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and how to use those parts together.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> <strong><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5: Blinking a Light for the First Time</a></strong> shows how two new components, capacitors and relays, work. You’ll even combine these with an LED to create a circuit that blinks a light.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> <strong><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06">Chapter 6: Let’s Solder!</a></strong> teaches you how to solder. With soldering, you can transform a circuit from a prototype to a proper device that will last for years to come.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> <strong><a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7: Controlling Things with Electricity</a></strong> introduces the transistor, a component that lets a circuit control other circuits. You’ll learn how transistors work and how to use them to build a touch sensor and a simple alarm clock.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> In <strong><a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8: Building a Musical Instrument</a></strong>, you’ll learn what an integrated circuit is and how circuits can make sound. You’ll combine this knowledge to build a musical instrument.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindenttb"><strong><a href="part03.xhtml#part03">Part 3: The Digital World</a></strong> introduces digital electronics, which almost all modern technology is based upon.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> In <strong><a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9: How Circuits Understand Ones and Zeros</a></strong>, you’ll learn about 1s and 0s, bits and bytes, and how to use them to communicate.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxvii"/><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> <strong><a href="ch10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10: Circuits That Make Choices</a></strong> teaches you how to build smart circuits that use logic to make decisions. You’ll build a secret code checker and learn how you can combine it with your intruder alarm.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> <strong><a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11: Circuits That Remember Information</a></strong> shows how you can use logic gates to create circuits that remember information in a way similar to a computer. Then, you’ll use this to create an electronic coin tosser.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> <strong><a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12">Chapter 12: Let’s Make a Game!</a></strong> is dedicated to one large project. You’ll get to show off your new skills by combining all the knowledge from the book to make a reaction speed game.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentt">Finally, you’ll find a <strong>Handy Resources</strong> appendix at the back of the book, which includes cheat sheets for figuring out component values, doing some essential electronics calculations, and so on. You’ll learn about those concepts in detail throughout the book, but even electronics experts need a quick reference every now and then!</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec02"><span class="green">YOUR ELECTRONICS LAB</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The wonderful thing about electronics projects is that your “lab” can be anywhere you want—it doesn’t have to be a garage or workshop. All you need is a flat surface to work on, with enough room for your tools and components. Just gather the supplies to build your latest invention, and you’re set.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Each project in this book includes a convenient list of the electronic components and tools needed to build it. Before you dig into a project, check its Shopping List to make sure you have all the materials. I’ve also created a complete list of all the components and tools you’ll need for all the projects in this book, which you can find linked from the book’s web page at <em><a href="https://www.nostarch.com/electronicsforkids/">https://www.nostarch.com/electronicsforkids/</a></em>. This list should always have the most up-to-date part numbers and links to kits you can buy that contain all the necessary components.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec04"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxviii"/><span class="green">Useful Supplies</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Whether you’re building the projects in this book or other projects on your own, there are a few supplies that will always come in handy:</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> <strong>A digital multimeter</strong> (Jameco #2206061, Bitsbox #TL057, Rapid Electronics #55-6662) for testing connections and making sure a project is working correctly.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> <strong>A pair of wire cutters</strong> (Jameco #35482, Bitsbox #TL008)</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> <strong>A big spool of insulated wire</strong> (Jameco #36792, Bitsbox #W106BK)</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> <strong>Electrical tape</strong> to protect bare wires or fasten stuff.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> <strong>9 V batteries</strong>—nearly every project in the book uses one!</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> <strong>A bunch of LEDs</strong> (Jameco #18041, Bitsbox #K033)</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> <strong>A bunch of resistors</strong> (Jameco #2217511, Bitsbox #K017)</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> <strong>Safety glasses</strong> to wear when snipping component leads, stripping wires, or soldering.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentt">You can buy most of these from your local hardware store or from any online electronics retailer, like Jameco (<em><a href="http://www.jameco.com/">http://www.jameco.com/</a></em>), SparkFun (<em><a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/">http://www.sparkfun.com/</a></em>), or Bitsbox (<em><a href="http://www.bitsbox.co.uk/">http://www.bitsbox.co.uk/</a></em>). Check out “<a href="app01.xhtml#app01lev1sec04">Online Electronics Shops</a>” on <a href="app01.xhtml#page_286">page 286</a> for more options.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You might also want to have a pair of scissors, some scrap paper, and pencils to take notes.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec05"><span class="green">Safety First!</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindentb">All the circuits in this book use a low voltage, and they’re not dangerous to build and play with. That said, there are a few safety tips to keep in mind when using electronic components and tools:</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> Wear safety glasses when trimming components or soldering.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> Use tools only for their intended purpose. Soldering irons are hot, and wire cutters are sharp—if used improperly, they can hurt you. If you’re confused about how to use a tool, ask an adult for help.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxix"/><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> An adult should supervise younger children when they’re working with small components, solder, tools, and so on to teach them how to use everything safely.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> Keep electronic parts out of reach of babies and very young children.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> Most projects in this book use batteries, but some do use power from a wall outlet. Follow the instructions for those circuits carefully. Never plug components directly into a power outlet, or you will get hurt.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentt">Some projects do have steps you should take special care with, and I will clearly state that in the instructions with a warning, like this:</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="red">WARNING</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>When you see this type of note, be careful with the step it talks about.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Electronics is a safe hobby, though, so you won’t see very many of these warnings. When you do see one, don’t let it stop you from having fun. If you use common sense and follow the directions, you’ll have nothing to worry about.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now let’s get started!<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxx"/></p>&#13;

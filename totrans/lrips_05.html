A large stream split into
two and flowed around either side of the town.</p><p>“Do you know anything about this place?” Laurie asked.</p><p>“The people are kind of strange,” said Xor.</p><p>“What does that mean?”</p><p>“You’ll see.”</p><p>The path led to a gateway with a turnstile. It looked like this: ╞</p><p>Two boys about Laurie’s age were guarding the gateway. One wore a bright white suit and
a black shirt. The other had a bright black suit and a white shirt.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Maybe they’ll ask me a riddle</em></span>, Laurie thought. <span class="emphasis"><em>Or
I’ll need to figure out which one is a liar and which one tells the truth!</em></span> Laurie
had read a lot of fairy tales, you see. She believed she was figuring out how this place
worked.</p><p>“Name?” asked one.</p><p>“Laurie Ipsum.”</p><p>“Password?” asked the other.</p><p>“Why, I don’t know the password,” Laurie said.</p><p>“Then you may not enter!” the boys said in unison.</p><p>“That’s not much of a riddle.”</p><p>“A riddle? Ha ha, no, begging your pardon, miss. That’s not how it works. There
are no riddles, no bets, no liars, and no truth-tellers. We’ve read those books too,
haven’t we, Tollens?”</p><p>“Yes, we have, Ponens. There’s none of that mythic fairy-tale stuff in our System,
miss. Word games and clever riddles, ha! That’s just bad security!”</p><p>“But that’s not fair!” cried Laurie. “How do I get
inside?”</p><p>“It’s very simple,” said Ponens. “If you have a password, then that
means you can pass through the semantic turnstile.”</p><p>“If you can’t pass through the turnstile, then that means you don’t have a
password. It’s only logical,” Tollens said. “Do you have a password?”</p><p>“No, I don’t know what it is,” Laurie said.</p><p>“Then you may not enter!” they said again, together.</p><p>“Can you give me a hint?” Laurie was sure she could guess the password, given some
kind of clue.</p><p>“Yes, hints are part of the System,” said Ponens.</p><p>“Oh, good.”</p><p>“Did you set up a hint with your account?” asked Tollens.</p><p>“Well, no,” she said. “This is my first time here.”</p><p>“Then it’s hard luck for you, miss,” said Ponens. “Once you are
inside, do make sure to set up a hint for the next time.”</p><p>“And remember to change your password to something memorable, but hard to guess,”
said Tollens. “It’s just good security.”</p><p>“But I’m trying to <span class="emphasis"><em>get</em></span> inside! I don’t know what to
do!”</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00012a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00012"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/037fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>“It’s very simple,” said Ponens. “If you have a password, then that
means you can pass through the semantic turnstile.”</p><p>“And if you can’t pass through the turnstile, then that means you don’t have
a password. It’s only logical,” Tollens said.</p><p>“That’s not completely true, is it?” Laurie said. “What if the
turnstile is broken? I wouldn’t be able to enter even if I had a password.”</p><p>“Um . . .” Tollens looked a little unsure of himself.</p><p>“Or what if I fooled you into <span class="emphasis"><em>believing</em></span> I had the password, even if
I didn’t? Then I could enter without it.”</p><p>“Hmm.” Ponens considered Laurie’s argument, trying to find a flaw.</p><p>Laurie rushed on. “Or what if I had the password, but I didn’t want to give it to
you?”</p><p>“No, you still couldn’t encroach on our premises,” Ponens said with more
confidence. “You have to give us a password that matches the name you give us.”</p><p>“Is it ‘Laurie’?” she guessed.</p><p>“No!” they shouted together.</p><p>“Is it ‘November First’?” That was Laurie’s birthday.</p><p>“No!” they shouted again.</p><p>“Only one try left, miss,” said Tollens.</p><p>“Oh, no! Really?”</p><p>“You can try only so many times. It’s just good security.”</p><p>“Do I even have an account?” she wondered.</p><p>“We can’t confirm or deny that,” answered Ponens. “That would be bad
security.”</p><p>“Do I . . . <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> have an account?”</p><p>“We can’t deny or confirm that, either!” answered Tollens.</p><p>“It’s very simple—” began Ponens.</p><p>“—yes, yes,” Laurie interrupted. “If I have it, I know it, but if I
don’t, you can’t tell me. And you can give me a hint only if I set it up earlier!”
This certainly was very good security. <span class="emphasis"><em>Think, Laurie, think!</em></span></p><p>“Okay, let’s start over,” she said.</p><p>“Very well, miss,” said Tollens. “Name?”</p><p>“I told you, it’s Lau—” she stopped herself. “Actually . . . my
name is Eponymous Bach.”</p><p>“Password?” said Ponens.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>It couldn’t be that simple, could it?</em></span></p><p>“Bach’s Password.”</p><p>“Welcome!” said Ponens and Tollens, waving her through the turnstile.</p><p>Of course Bach would name her password after herself!</p></div></body></html>

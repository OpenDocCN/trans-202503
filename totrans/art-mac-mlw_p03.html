<p class="PartIntro">It’s time to put the universal adage “practice makes perfect” into, well, practice. In Part III of this book, you’ll apply all that you’ve learned in Parts I and II to thoroughly analyze the intriguing Mac malware specimen known as EvilQuest. Discovered in the summer of 2020, this malware appeared at first blush to be little more than a run-of-the-mill piece of ransomware. However, further analysis uncovered something far more sophisticated.</p>
<p>You’ll get the most out of this section by following along and performing the analysis with me. First, make sure you’ve created a safe analysis environment; return to this book’s introduction for guidelines on doing so. Then download the EvilQuest specimen from Objective-See’s Mac malware collection at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://objective-see.com/downloads/malware/EvilQuest.zip">https://objective-see.com/downloads/malware/EvilQuest.zip</a><em>. </em>Use the password<em> </em><code>infect3d</code> to decrypt the malicious sample. </p>

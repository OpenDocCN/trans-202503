- en: Installing GIMP on your computer is no longer difficult. Thus, this appendix
    will be rather short, and if you run into trouble, you will find help on the websites
    mentioned in [Appendix C](apc.html "Appendix C. Resources"). The official GIMP
    website (*[http://www.gimp.org/](http://www.gimp.org/)*) is the best way to obtain
    instructions for downloading and installing GIMP and its components.

    buying a commercial distribution of GIMP is useless and possibly even harmful:
    It will have no added value other than some elaborate packaging, and some commercial
    distributions are known to contain viruses. Do not download GIMP from sites that
    are not the official GIMP site or that are not directly pointed to by the GIMP
    website.'

- en: GIMP was initially designed for GNU/Linux, and most of its developers work on
    this operating system. Therefore, installing it on this system is especially easy.
    Moreover, the main GNU/Linux distributions provide automated tools for installing
    GIMP (if it’s not already installed by default). Of course, if your distribution
    was installed some months ago, and you do not regularly update it, most likely
    the version of GIMP on your system is not the latest one (i.e., 2.8), so you need
    to update your software. In most cases, simply updating your installation is enough.

    world is still dominated by various versions of the Windows operating system.
    As explained on *[http://www.gimp.org/windows/](http://www.gimp.org/windows/)*,
    Jernej Simončič contributed a GIMP installer for Windows and updates it for every
    new version. From the website *[http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/stable.html](http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/stable.html)*,
    you can download the package and install it immediately. It contains everything
    you will need and installs smoothly on Windows XP SP2 and later versions. The
    installation process is similar to that of most applications and is not detailed
    here. Once GIMP is installed, download and install any additional plug-ins from
    the GIMP Plugin Registry (*[http://registry.gimp.org/](http://registry.gimp.org/)*).

    languages. We also recommend that, if you already have a previous version of GIMP
    installed, you first uninstall it before trying to install GIMP 2.8.

    Of course, the Windows desktop environment is different from the various available
    GNU/Linux environments, and it is generally less convenient for using GIMP. With
    Windows, you do not have the advantage of several workspaces, which means all
    windows are on the same screen, and handling several applications at the same
    time, or even a single application with several windows, can be cumbersome.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Windows users will probably prefer the single-window mode GIMP interface, described
    in [Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. The GIMP Interface"). This does not mean
    that the multi-window interface is not available, but Windows users will have
    to change some of their habits to use it. Moreover, such an interface is handy
    only if you can change the window manager’s behavior so a window becomes active
    as soon as your mouse pointer is on it. Having to click twice every time you change
    from the Toolbox to the Image window (one click activates the window; the second
    click triggers the intended action) can be very annoying.

    don’t forget that installing a GNU/Linux distribution on your computer, in addition
    to Windows, is easy, as is sharing the same data with the two operating systems.

    and GIMP on the Mac now behaves in exactly the same way as on other operating
    systems. Even the menu bar uses the GIMP style, not the Mac style, so the top
    bar on your screen will not be very useful. Mac users will probably prefer the
    single-window mode interface for the same reasons that Windows users do.

- en: Ghidra is a freely available open source SRE tool suite developed by the National
    Security Agency (NSA). The platform-independent Ghidra environment includes an
    interactive disassembler and decompiler as well as a plethora of related tools
    that work together to help you analyze code. It supports a wide variety of instruction
    set architectures and binary formats and can be run in both stand-alone and collaborative
    SRE configurations. Perhaps the best feature of Ghidra is that it allows you to
    customize your work environment and develop your own plugins and scripts to enhance
    your SRE process and to share your innovations with the Ghidra community at large.

    most new users will likely download Ghidra and choose to start with the most current
    version of Ghidra Core, which includes traditional reverse engineering functionality.
    The focus of this book is on the Ghidra Core functionality for nonshared projects.
    In addition, we spend time discussing shared projects and headless Ghidra as well
    as the Developer, Function ID, and Experimental configurations.

    a destination on your computer? If everything went as planned, you should now
    have a *zip* file in your selected directory. For the original Ghidra release,
    the *zip* file’s name was *ghidra_9.0_PUBLIC_20190228.zip*. We can break down
    the naming convention. First, *9.0* is the version number. Next, *PUBLIC* is the
    type of release (there are other release types such as *BETA_DEV* releases). Finally,
    we have the release date, followed by the *.zip* file extension.

    the Ghidra framework. If you are happy with the location you saved the file to,
    unzipping it (for example, by right-clicking and selecting Extract All in Windows)
    will provide access to the Ghidra hierarchical directory. Note that Ghidra needs
    to compile some of its internal data files, so a Ghidra user will typically need
    write access to all Ghidra program subdirectories.

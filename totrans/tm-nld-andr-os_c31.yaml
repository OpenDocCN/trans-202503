- en: 'Android also developed its own engineering culture, from a combination of its
    isolation from the rest of Google plus the fundamentally different products it
    was working on compared to the rest of the company. Evan Millar observed: “Android
    felt very much like the Wild West back then. There weren’t very many rules. There
    weren’t very many tools. There weren’t really a lot of best practices or style
    guides or anything telling you the right way to do things. But the cool thing
    about it was that it meant you could kind of do whatever you wanted to do and
    try whatever you wanted to try. It was a very open-to-innovation, open-to-trying-things
    sort of culture that I really loved. I was really happy in Android for a long
    time.'

    were a lot of people who had done this sort of thing before and knew what they
    were doing. Really smart people, really experienced people on Android. A lot of
    these people had been at Be and shipped an OS there. Some of them were at Apple
    and worked on similar things there. So it’s not that we didn’t have deep expertise
    and experience, because we did. But it just felt like the Wild West. It felt like
    nobody really knew what they were doing, and we were just feeling our way through
    it. We didn’t know if it was going to totally flop, or if it was going to work.
    And when it worked, I think people were as surprised as they were excited.”

    Google has long had a notion of “20 percent time,” which allows employees to spend
    up to 20 percent of their time working on some project that could benefit Google.^([1](#c31-footnote-1))
    It’s a grand tradition that has resulted in some fantastic products, including
    Gmail. Android engineers tended to be too busy doing their main work to ponder
    what else to take on, so 20 percent time wasn’t as common on the Android team.

    couple of years after Android was acquired, because the project was very secretive.
    But when people did know about it, it wasn’t seen as a successful project in those
    early days.

    of 2007, two months before the SDK launch. “When I decided to join Android, some
    people were like, ‘Why would you do that? The iPhone is obviously dominating.
    It’s such an amazing product, why would you go up against that?’ In some cases
    they’d seen the early prototypes, and were like, ‘Y’all are like months behind,
    why bother? Apple just obviously wins.’”

    apps for non-Android platforms. He remembered the internal feeling toward Android:
    “It was just a random project on the side. There was no way it was going to succeed.
    People wouldn’t be that negative, but they were like, ‘That’s crazy. How are you
    possibly going to influence the telecom industry?’”'

    have a lot of time to spend on collaborating with other teams at Google. Tom Moss
    remembered, “We burned a lot of bridges. But we kind of had to. We really did
    have to say, ‘No, we have a mission and we have to stick to that mission. When
    we succeed, everything will be easier.’”

    Android team, “which was like a company in a company. Some people were kind of
    resentful of being acquired and wanted to keep the scrappiness. In the beginning,
    we didn’t have code reviews, it was a different interview process, people didn’t
    write tests. . . . It was a bit of a culture shock for me.”

    of companies she’d worked in prior to Google. “The typical roles of product manager:
    design docs, code reviews, etc., all went out the window when I got to Android.
    It wasn’t as jarring for me because I had come from two startups, so it was kind
    of normal. It felt like I had moved to another startup again. It did not feel
    like Google at all. For other people who came from Google, it was kind of a rude
    awakening.”'

- en: 'Android also developed its own engineering culture, from a combination of its
    isolation from the rest of Google plus the fundamentally different products it
    was working on compared to the rest of the company. Evan Millar observed: “Android
    felt very much like the Wild West back then. There weren’t very many rules. There
    weren’t very many tools. There weren’t really a lot of best practices or style
    guides or anything telling you the right way to do things. But the cool thing
    about it was that it meant you could kind of do whatever you wanted to do and
    try whatever you wanted to try. It was a very open-to-innovation, open-to-trying-things
    sort of culture that I really loved. I was really happy in Android for a long
    time.'

  zh: Android也发展出了自己独特的工程文化，这源于其与Google其他部门的隔离，以及与公司其他产品相比，Android所从事的产品有着根本性的不同。Evan
    Millar曾观察到：“那时的Android很像西部荒野。那时几乎没有规则，也没有多少工具。没有什么最佳实践或风格指南，甚至没有任何人告诉你做事的正确方式。但有趣的是，这也意味着你几乎可以做任何你想做的事情，尝试任何你想尝试的东西。这是一个非常开放、鼓励创新和尝试的文化，我真的很喜欢。在Android工作时，我感到非常快乐，持续了很长时间。”
- en: “In retrospect, I can see the pros and cons of that approach. Obviously, there
    were a lot of people who had done this sort of thing before and knew what they
    were doing. Really smart people, really experienced people on Android. A lot of
    these people had been at Be and shipped an OS there. Some of them were at Apple
    and worked on similar things there. So it’s not that we didn’t have deep expertise
    and experience, because we did. But it just felt like the Wild West. It felt like
    nobody really knew what they were doing, and we were just feeling our way through
    it. We didn’t know if it was going to totally flop, or if it was going to work.
    And when it worked, I think people were as surprised as they were excited.”

  zh: “回过头来看，我能看到这种方法的利与弊。显然，有很多人在之前做过类似的事情，知道自己在做什么。Android上有很多聪明的人，经验丰富的人。这些人中的许多人曾在Be工作并推出了操作系统，有些人曾在Apple工作并参与了类似的项目。所以并不是我们没有深厚的专业知识和经验，因为我们确实有。但那时的感觉就像是西部荒野。感觉没有人真正知道自己在做什么，我们只是摸索着前进。我们不知道最终会失败，还是会成功。当它成功时，我想人们既惊讶又兴奋。”
- en: There were also subtler differences between the Android and Google cultures.
    Google has long had a notion of “20 percent time,” which allows employees to spend
    up to 20 percent of their time working on some project that could benefit Google.^([1](#c31-footnote-1))
    It’s a grand tradition that has resulted in some fantastic products, including
    Gmail. Android engineers tended to be too busy doing their main work to ponder
    what else to take on, so 20 percent time wasn’t as common on the Android team.

  zh: Android和Google的文化之间也存在着更微妙的差异。Google长期以来一直有一个“20%时间”的概念，允许员工将最多20%的时间用于一些可能对Google有益的项目。^([1](#c31-footnote-1))
    这是一个伟大的传统，催生了一些出色的产品，包括Gmail。而Android的工程师通常忙于本职工作，很少有时间去考虑还能做些什么，因此“20%时间”在Android团队中并不常见。

- en: Dan Egnor joined Android’s services team from Google’s search team in August
    of 2007, two months before the SDK launch. “When I decided to join Android, some
    people were like, ‘Why would you do that? The iPhone is obviously dominating.
    It’s such an amazing product, why would you go up against that?’ In some cases
    they’d seen the early prototypes, and were like, ‘Y’all are like months behind,
    why bother? Apple just obviously wins.’”

    “It was just a random project on the side. There was no way it was going to succeed.

    Android team, “which was like a company in a company. Some people were kind of
    resentful of being acquired and wanted to keep the scrappiness. In the beginning,
    we didn’t have code reviews, it was a different interview process, people didn’t

- en: 'Peisun Wu, who also came from another team in Google, agreed. It reminded her
    of companies she’d worked in prior to Google. “The typical roles of product manager:
    design docs, code reviews, etc., all went out the window when I got to Android.
    It wasn’t as jarring for me because I had come from two startups, so it was kind
    of normal. It felt like I had moved to another startup again. It did not feel
    like Google at all. For other people who came from Google, it was kind of a rude

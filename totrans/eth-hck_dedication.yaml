- en: This book is dedicated to my loving wife, Shea Graham, who supported me throughout
    this process. I want the world to know how much I love you. Thanks for reading
    all the rough drafts. This book would not have been possible without your encouragement
    and support. May our future children be inspired to share their ideas with the
    universe and grow into a prosperous generation of Christians.

    in our family to go to college; my mother, Angelique Graham, who loves us unconditionally
    and always supported us; my sister, Dr. Dominique Vaughn, who is my friend for
    life; and my brother-in-law Adrian Vaughn, my father-in-law Les Tinsley, and my
    mother-in-law Fay Tinsley.'

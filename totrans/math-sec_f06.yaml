    directly or indirectly. When I decided to publish my work in 2016, I had no idea
    just how many people would pitch in to help me finish what I started. Then I started
    thinking about all the people I really owed my career growth to over the years.
    It has made me realize it would be impossible for me to list each of you individually,
    so let me start by saying a general thank-you to everyone who has contributed
    to any of my projects over the last 20 years. The hacker community has always
    been about the open sharing of knowledge. It’s through this sharing and encouragement
    that I was able to develop the skills to be a security analyst. The organizers
    of conferences like DEF CON and local BSides events deserve a special thanks for
    all the effort they put in. Attending these events is a chance to bond with the
    members of our community and learn from one another. These events can also be
    chaotic whirlwinds behind the scenes, and organizing this chaos is no small feat!
    I’d also like to thank the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and Daniel Trujillo at
    the Artists Rights Society for helping me navigate the licensing process for the
    Guggenheim images used in the book. I’ve never worked copyrights, but you made
    the whole process exceedingly simple, which I appreciate!

- en: I also want to say a huge thank-you to the team at No Starch Press. The time
    you’ve all put in to making my scribbles into a book is truly amazing. I never
    really understood the work it takes to produce a No Starch title, and now that
    I do, I appreciate my collection even more! Athabasca and Alex, you’ve both spent
    so much time revising my drafts that I can honestly say this book wouldn’t exist
    without you! Jill, Miles, and Rachel, you’ve all taught me so much about the editorial
    process. I cannot think of a better team of people to have supported me through
    this process.

    grow and evolve, but my teammates at Easy Metrics deserve special recognition.
    I seriously couldn’t have accomplished any of this without all the knowledge and
    support you’ve all provided over the years we’ve known each other. Dean, Derek,
    Jessica, Josh, Owen, and Paul: you’ve each brought a special set of skills to
    the group dynamic, and I’ve learned so much from working with you over the years.
    I’m honored to count you all as colleagues and friends. Dan, you’ve been more
    than my manager; you’ve been my friend and sifu. I’ve learned more about business
    in our casual chats than most people pay a tuition for. With a team like ours,
    there’s nothing we can’t accomplish! Jay, what can I say other than thank you
    for everything, from teaching me how to run product development and encouraging
    me to take my security research more seriously, to being my sounding board for
    wild ideas and helping me rein them in just the right amount. You’re a great mentor
    and friend, and there’s always a spot open for you at my campfire.'

    time, energy, knowledge, love, and encouragement that I want to let them know
    how important they’ve been. Tony and Bam, my lawyer advised me that I cannot thank
    you for specific events that may implicate anyone in that thing that time, but
    you know. You’re more than just my closest friends; you’re the family that I needed
    when I needed it the most. Plus, I’ve learned more about security from hanging
    out with you two than any course, class, or book could ever hope to teach. In
    a lot of ways, this is all your fault!

- en: Finally, the biggest thanks goes to my girlfriend and kids for putting up with
    me. I know I can be a lot to absorb at times. You’ve been subjected to impromptu
    math lectures and dragged to security conferences, or left at home when I traveled
    to one. You take care of literally everything while I get lost in weeks-long coding
    projects. You’ve done everything possible to support me through my career, and
    I love you all.

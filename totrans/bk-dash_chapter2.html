<p class="ChapterIntro">In this chapter we’ll introduce you to the PyCharm IDE. An <i>IDE</i>, short for <i>integrated development environment</i>, is a text editor that provides various tools to help you write code and has the potential to accelerate your programming productivity significantly. Modern IDEs generally have features like code highlighting, dynamic tool tips, auto-completion, syntax checking, code linters that check for style issues, version control to safeguard the history of your edits, debugging, visual aids, and performance optimization tools and profilers, to name a few.</p>
<p class="TX">As your Python dashboard applications grow, so will your need to aggregate all your source code in a single spot and in a single development environment. Increasing complexity quickly demands the use of an IDE. To follow along with the provided code examples in this book, we recommend <span aria-label=" Page 20. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_20" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>you use PyCharm, an IDE specifically for Python. PyCharm is one of the most popular IDEs and is available for all operating systems. It simplifies the development of advanced applications, and the plethora of online tutorials and documentation is phenomenal for support. PyCharm also integrates well with Dash applications in that it allows you to run and debug them, install the required libraries quickly and easily, and use syntax checking and linters. However, if you have a preference for another IDE, such as VS Code, the instructions in this book will be easy to adapt.</p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec1"><a id="h1-13"></a><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Installing PyCharm</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI">Let’s start by downloading the latest version of PyCharm. The examples here are for the Windows operating system, but the steps are similar on macOS. If you’re using Linux, you can check out the instructions to unpack and install the IDE in our PyCharm tutorial at <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/pycharm-a-simple-illustrated-guide"><i>https://<wbr/>blog<wbr/>.finxter<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/pycharm<wbr/>-a<wbr/>-simple<wbr/>-illustrated<wbr/>-guide</i></a>. Using PyCharm is very similar across different operating systems. Go to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download"><i>https://<wbr/>www<wbr/>.jetbrains<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/pycharm<wbr/>/download</i></a> and you should see something like <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-1">Figure 2-1</a><i>.</i></p>

</figure>
<p class="TX">Click <b>Download</b> for the free community version (<a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-1">Figure 2-1</a>), and once it’s downloaded, run the executable installer and follow the installation steps. We recommend simply accepting all the default settings suggested by the installer.</p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec2"><a id="h1-14"></a><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Creating a Project</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI">Find PyCharm on your system and run it. Select <b>New Project</b>, and you should see a window similar to <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-2">Figure 2-2</a>. There are a few options in this user interface to pay attention to: a project name, which you enter as the suffix in the Location field; the virtual environment; the Python interpreter; and the checkbox for creating a <i>main.py</i> script.</p>
<span aria-label=" Page 21. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_21" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><a id="fig2-2"></a>
<figure class="IMG"><img alt="" class="img90" height="548" src="../images/Figure2-2.png" width="696"/>
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 2-2: Setting up a PyCharm project</samp></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="TX">We’ll call our project <i>firstDashProject</i>, but you can use any name you want. A short, all-lowercase project name would be more idiomatic, but we’ll use something more obvious for the time being. To give it another name, just modify the suffix text after the last backslash (\) in the Location field.</p>
<p class="TX">The virtual environment and interpreter fields should auto-populate with whatever PyCharm detects on your system. In <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-2">Figure 2-2</a>, that’s Python 3.7. We’ll therefore use the virtual environment that comes with the standard Python installation, Virtualenv. Using a virtual environment means that all packages you install, by default, will be installed only within the project environment and not on your machine, keeping everything relevant to a project in one neat place. One of the many advantages of virtualizing your project’s dependencies like this is that you can install conflicting versions for different projects without cluttering up your operating system. For example, if one project uses an older version of Dash and you need a newer version of Dash for another project, installing Dash globally will almost certainly cause problems. When you install the different Dash versions in different virtual environments—one per project—you avoid those version conflicts.</p>
<p class="TX">Finally, choose not to create a <i>main.py</i> welcome script by unchecking the box at the bottom. Many Python programs use <i>main.py</i> as the main entry point of their program. To execute the project, they execute the file <i>main.py</i>, which in turn kicks off all other functionality provided by the program. However, for Dash applications, the main entry point for your code is the file <span aria-label=" Page 22. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_22" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i>app.py</i> per convention—although you can generally use arbitrary filenames. We therefore recommend unchecking the <i>main.py</i> box for all Dash projects.</p>
<p class="TX">Everything else we’ll leave as it appears.</p>
<p class="TX">Click <b>Create</b> and you should see your first PyCharm dashboard project! It should look like <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-3">Figure 2-3</a>.</p>

<p class="TX">Before we dive into the details of how to create a dashboard application in PyCharm, let’s take a quick tour of the PyCharm interface (see <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-4">Figure 2-4</a>).</p>
<a id="fig2-4"></a>
<figure class="IMG"><img alt="" class="img100" height="441" src="../images/Figure2-4.png" width="845"/>
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 2-4: Overview of the PyCharm interface</samp></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 23. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_23" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-4">Figure 2-4</a> shows the most important elements of the interface:</p>
<div class="spc">
<p class="NL">1.  The <i>project tool window</i> gives you an overview of the project folder structure. For larger projects, it’s critical that you maintain a high-level overview of how all the code functions and all the modules play together to provide a coherent whole.</p>
<p class="NL">2.  The <i>editor window</i> allows you to open, write, and edit multiple code files from your code project. You can browse the project in the project tool window and double-click files to open them in the editor window. Here’s where you’ll write and edit the code.</p>
<p class="NL">3.  The <i>navigation bar</i> provides buttons and shortcuts to quickly perform the most important functions, such as starting and stopping the application, selecting the main module to be executed, searching files, and debugging your application.</p>
<p class="NL">4.  After you’ve started your application, you’ll observe its output and execution state in the <i>run tool window</i>. In <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-4">Figure 2-4</a>, we’ve just started our first dashboard application, so the run window shows the URL we can click or enter into the browser to check our dashboard application. If you use a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">print()</samp> statement in your code, this is where the printed output will appear.</p>
<p class="NL">5.  The run tool window also provides another navigation bar that allows you to switch between different <i>tabs</i> of the run tool window. For example, you can open a Python shell, open a command line in Windows or the Terminal in macOS to access functionality from your operating system, or debug your application in a step-by-step manner.</p>
</div>
<p class="TX">PyCharm comes with a lot of additional windows, but these are the most important ones you’ll use in any application, whether it’s a dashboard app or not. We’ll leave the rest for you to explore at your leisure.</p>

<p class="TNI">Now we’ll have a look at an example dashboard app from the official Dash documentation. This code creates the example dashboard app showing a simple bar plot graph in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-5">Figure 2-5</a>. It also starts a server on your local computer so that you can view the dashboard app in your browser.</p>

<p class="TX">We don’t expect you to understand this code yet, and we won’t go into details now. At a very high level, this code imports the necessary libraries, builds the app and sets its style, creates the data and visualizes it in a bar plot, and sets the overall layout to include things like headings. The last two lines start the server so that you can view it in your browser (see <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-6">Figure 2-6</a>). After studying the subsequent chapters, you’ll find this simple.</p>
<p class="TX">Now run your project: go to the top menu and select <b>Run</b><span class="MenuArrow">►</span><b>app.py</b>. You can also click the green play button in the navigation bar. However, you’ll see we’ve hit a snag: running the program displays an error in the <span aria-label=" Page 25. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_25" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>run tool window at the bottom, shown in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-6">Figure 2-6</a>. Our app doesn’t yet work because we’re importing Dash, but PyCharm doesn’t recognize Dash! The reason is that Dash is not part of the Python standard library: you’ll need to install it manually before you can use it in your project.</p>
<a id="fig2-6"></a>

<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 2-6: PyCharm Dash error</samp></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="TX">You may wonder why we didn’t just install Dash earlier. As you’ll see in a moment, because each project is isolated in its own virtual environment, this is good practice for how you’ll actually use Dash in the future.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="sec4" epub:type="division">
<h3 class="H1" id="sec4"><a id="h1-16"></a><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Installing Dash Through PyCharm</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI">There are two ways to install Dash: globally on your computer, which means each future project will be able to import Dash, or locally in your virtual environment, which means only this project will be able to import Dash and you’ll need to install it again for any projects in different virtual environments. The recommended way is to install it in the virtual environment.</p>
<p class="NTX-H"><span class="NoteHead"><samp class="SANS_Dogma_OT_Bold_B_15">NOTE</samp></span></p>
<p class="NTX"><i>PyCharm may run slightly differently on different systems, so if you run into trouble with this step, check out our full guide at</i> <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-install-a-library-on-pycharm"><span class="Roman">https://<wbr/>blog<wbr/>.finxter<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/how<wbr/>-to<wbr/>-install<wbr/>-a<wbr/>-library<wbr/>-on<wbr/>-pycharm</span></a> <i>for help.</i></p>
<p class="TX">PyCharm allows us to install Dash directly through our app code. Click the red underlined dash library import line and hover your cursor there; a small red lightbulb should appear with a menu. Choose the <b>Install Package Dash</b> option shown in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-7">Figure 2-7</a>.</p>
<span aria-label=" Page 26. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_26" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><a id="fig2-7"></a>

<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 2-7: Installing Dash through PyCharm</samp></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="TX">Note that this option only appears if you have created the PyCharm project within a virtual environment (see <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-2">Figure 2-2</a>). If you don’t see the package installation option, you can open the Terminal tab in your run tool window and enter:</p>
<p class="CodeCustom1"><samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$</samp> <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W7Bold_B_11">pip install dash</samp></p>
<p class="TX">Installing the dash library will take a few moments. It’s important to remember that the library is installed only in this <i>virtual environment</i>—that is, not on your global operating system but only on a project level. For a different project, you may have to install Dash again.</p>
<p class="TX">Depending on your local environment, you may have to repeat the same procedure to install the pandas library as well. Visit the pandas installation guide at <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-install-pandas-on-pycharm"><i>https://<wbr/>blog<wbr/>.finxter<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/how<wbr/>-to<wbr/>-install<wbr/>-pandas<wbr/>-on<wbr/>-pycharm</i></a>. We’ll cover pandas installation in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a></span>.</p>
<p class="TX">Now try running <i>app.py</i> again, and you should see something like this:</p>
<p class="_CodeSpaceAbove"><samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Dash is running on</samp> <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">http://127.0.0.1:8050/</samp></p>

<p class="_CodeSpaceBelow"><samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">   * Debug mode: on</samp></p>
<p class="TX">Your app is being hosted on your local machine, so nobody can access it from the outside world. Internally, Dash uses Python’s Flask library for the heavy lifting to serve the website to users. To test your application, copy <i>http://127.0.0.1:8050/</i> into your browser or click it in the output window in PyCharm. This URL indicates that the dashboard app runs on a local server hosted on your machine with IP address 127.0.0.1—this is a <i>loopback</i> address commonly referred to as <i>localhost</i> that you could read as “your local computer”—and port 8050.</p>

<p class="TNI">An excellent way to learn about Dash and get used to PyCharm is to copy existing Dash projects from experts and play around with their code. Studying code projects from the experts is one of the best ways to test and improve your thinking. Earlier, you tried out the example app by copying and pasting the code in the file <i>app.py</i>. This is not always the most convenient way, given that many code projects consist of multiple files and more complicated folder structures. Here we’ll clone a GitHub project. Most open source projects are available on GitHub, so there are plenty for you to look at.</p>
<p class="NTX-H"><span class="NoteHead"><samp class="SANS_Dogma_OT_Bold_B_15">NOTE</samp></span></p>
<p class="NTX"><i>Before we begin, you’ll need to have GitHub installed. If you don’t, you can either download Git from the official website (</i><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"><span class="Roman">https://git-scm.com/downloads</span></a>) <i>or install it through PyCharm.</i></p>
<p class="TX">To clone a GitHub project into a new PyCharm project, first get the URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone; there are lots at <a href="https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps"><i>https://<wbr/>github<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/plotly<wbr/>/dash<wbr/>-sample<wbr/>-apps</i></a> to choose from. <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-8">Figure 2-8</a> shows some sample Dash Gallery apps from Plotly.</p>
<a id="fig2-8"></a>

<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 2-8: Sample Dash Gallery apps on GitHub</samp></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="TX">Click <b>Code</b> in the repository and copy the URL. For example, you can use <a href="https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps.git"><i>https://<wbr/>github<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/plotly<wbr/>/dash<wbr/>-sample<wbr/>-apps<wbr/>.git</i></a> to access a repository of all Dash apps from the gallery.</p>
<p class="TX">Open PyCharm and click <b>VCS</b><span class="MenuArrow">►</span><b>Get from Version Control</b>, shown in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-9">Figure 2-9</a>. Enter the URL in the URL field. Note that building this project will create a new project from the Git project URL, so it doesn’t matter from which project you start.</p>

</figure>
<p class="TX">Click <b>Clone</b> and wait for the operation to finish. This may take some time because the repository contains all Dash Gallery projects. Installing the whole repository allows you to quickly try out many different Dash projects and examine how the experts implement the Dash features you’re interested in.</p>
<p class="TX">Next, PyCharm asks you to set up a virtual environment to install the libraries the sample apps need (see <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-10">Figure 2-10</a>). Click <b>OK</b>. For troubleshooting, please follow the detailed strategy outlined at <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.xhtml"><i>https://<wbr/>www<wbr/>.jetbrains<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/help<wbr/>/pycharm<wbr/>/creating<wbr/>-virtual<wbr/>-environment<wbr/>.xhtml</i></a>.</p>

<p class="TX">If you’d like to see more example Dash apps, the Dash Gallery at <a href="https://dash.gallery/Portal"><i>https://<wbr/>dash<wbr/>.gallery<wbr/>/Portal</i></a> points to many GitHub repositories created by Dash experts. Cloning them is as simple as replicating these steps using the URLs provided by the Dash Gallery. If you’re not using PyCharm, you can check out this guide on how to clone an existing repository: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository"><i>https://<wbr/>docs<wbr/>.github<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/en<wbr/>/github<wbr/>/creating<wbr/>-cloning<wbr/>-and<wbr/>-archiving<wbr/>-repositories<wbr/>/cloning<wbr/>-a<wbr/>-repository</i></a>. And don’t worry—you cannot destroy anything, so feel free to play with the code. A version control system such as Git allows you to go back to the initial state easily.</p>

<p class="TNI">In this chapter, you learned how to set up PyCharm, one of the most popular Python IDEs. PyCharm integrates well with Python Dash. Specifically, you learned how to install PyCharm and third-party libraries like Dash through PyCharm, create a first simple Dash project, run the project, and view your dashboard app in the browser. Furthermore, you learned how to integrate PyCharm with the most popular version control system, Git, so that you can check out existing Dash apps to learn and collaborate with others.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 30. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_30" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>In fact, now would be a great time to follow the steps in this tutorial, clone one of the existing dashboard apps in the gallery, run it, and tweak simple things like colors and text labels to get accustomed to Dash! We’ll explain everything in detail in the upcoming chapters, but it doesn’t hurt to open the knowledge gap before trying to close it, does it?</p>
<p class="TX">With PyCharm installed, we’ll move on to an introduction of the pandas library. The pandas library helps you organize and process the data you want to visualize in your dashboard app!</p>

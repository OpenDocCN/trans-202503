    movie. Maybe you stumbled upon a YouTuber talking through the process. Or maybe
    you happened upon a lockpick village at a hacker conference. Regardless of where
    it was, you probably felt some mix of excitement, intrigue, and perhaps skepticism.
    For some of us, these feelings led to pursuing lockpicking for fun, which turned
    into a hobby, and that hobby became a sport.

    never intended. We use this term to describe both the hobby of opening locks and
    the competitions to see who can do so the fastest. While *lockpicking* is the
    best-known form of locksport, the sport includes other types of lock opening,
    such as *impressioning* (creating a working key for a lock without access to or
    knowledge of the original) and *safe-lock manipulation*, or *safe cracking* (determining
    a safe’s combination based on feedback from the safe’s dial).'

    knew where to look. One early example was Ted the Tool’s 1991 paper “The MIT Guide
    to Lockpicking,” a nicely illustrated guide that was many people’s introduction
    to lockpicking and that has now been translated into many languages. A few lockpicking
    books were available, such as those written by Eddie the Wire (it seems you need
    a pseudonym to write about lockpicking) and published by Loompanics Unlimited,
    a US book seller specializing in other controversial topics such as weapons, anarchism,
    and sex. Eddie’s introduction to *The Complete Guide to Lock Picking* (1981) reads,
    “When Eddie the Wire was twelve, his dad gave him three padlocks and no keys.
    The resulting frustration of a twelve-year-old led to Eddie’s early interest in
    escape artists, locks, and picks.” Eddie must have been that age sometime in the
    1960s. One can only guess where he got his information, if he didn’t figure it
    all out himself.

    founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1946\. The group’s
    interests encompassed more than just railroads; members also investigated computers,
    radios, and phone systems. They also liked *roof and tunnel hacking*, which sometimes
    involved lockpicking or lock bypassing. One TMRC member was theoretical physicist
    Richard Feynman, who, later in his career at the Los Alamos National Laboratory,
    opened colleagues’ safe locks as a hobby. Truth be told, this was more a matter
    of smart tricks and social engineering than actual lock manipulation. He describes
    his safe-cracking adventures vividly in his autobiography *Surely You’re Joking,
    Mr. Feynman!* (W.W. Norton, 1985).

    now have their own hackerspaces where you’ll find curious people with an interest

    created by Joseph Bramah. In 1790, Bramah put a lock in his store window, mounted
    on a board inscribed with “The artist who can make an instrument that will pick
    or open this lock shall receive 200 guineas the moment it is produced.” In 1851,
    locksmith Alfred C. Hobbs was the first to pick the Bramah lock, using a special
    tool he made himself. This 2-in-1 pick and tension tool is still called a *Hobbs
    hook* in several languages. (We’ll explain picks and tensioners in [Chapter 6](ch6.xhtml).)

    were a success, and a few months later, he and other enthusiasts founded SSDeV.

    attendee, Dutch hacker Tim Matthews, officially registered the Dutch lockpicking
    group Nederlandse Vereniging van Hang en Sluitsport (NVHS), which translates to
    “Dutch Association for Hinges and Locksport,” in Amsterdam a year later. (The

    is the art of creating a working key for a given lock by wiggling a blank key
    in the lock, looking at the tiny marks that result, and then filing them away.
    Back then, lockpickers tried out techniques such as using marker pens and chemicals
    on the key to help better identify the marks. (We’ll explain how to master this
    skill in [Part III](part3.xhtml).) In 2005, SSDeV added an impressioning competition
    to its portfolio, and Oliver Diederichsen of SSDeV dedicated his time to methodically
    figuring it out. He compiled his findings, along with fabulous pictures, in his
    self-published book *Impressioning*, enabling many more people to become successful

- en: If you’re found carrying lockpicking tools outside your home, for it to be considered
    a crime, the police must prove that you intend to use the tools to commit either
    theft or burglary. That’s a pretty high bar, so simple possession shouldn’t cause
    you any issues as long as you can demonstrate, to either the police or a court,
    that you’re interested in the hobby and participate in locksport groups or contests.
    Concurrent possession of a hard copy of this book would, for instance, show you
    were likely a sport picker. Concurrent possession of a balaclava and crowbar would
    tilt the opinion in the opposite direction. If you’re just sitting in a local
    pub in the afternoon with several others, picking locks peacefully, you’ll be
    fine. If the pub is closed and you’re caught sitting in the bar? Busted.

    tools, whether in a public or private environment. If you use them without permission
    on a lock you don’t own, again, that’s clearly illegal.

    The best way to get started is to join a local group of fellow lock enthusiasts.
    Don’t rush ahead and order your tools just yet! We’ll get into choosing the right
    ones in later chapters.

- en: Locksport is about community much more than it is about competition or bragging
    rights (though plenty of room remains for that as well). An afternoon spent with
    a handful of picking tools and a tableful of locks is best enjoyed with friends—and
    maybe a few frosty beverages. As long as you bring a genuine interest in the challenge
    of opening locks, the locksport community is one of the most helpful, accepting,
    and friendly groups you can find.

    Try searching for *locksport* or *lockpicking* on Meetup ([*https://www.meetup.com*](https://www.meetup.com));
    most clubs list their meetings there. Alternatively, check with any local hackerspaces,
    since a big crossover occurs among makers, hackers, and lockpickers. If you find
    nothing at all in your area, consider forming your own group. Once you find a
    few others who are interested, check the national organizations’ sites to learn
    how to become an official chapter.

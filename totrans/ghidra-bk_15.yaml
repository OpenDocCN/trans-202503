    to use as defaults every time you open a new project or that you want to apply
    to all files within a particular project. At this point, you may be confused as
    to why some of the options you have changed carry over from session to session,
    while other options need resetting every time you load a new project or file.
    In this chapter, we examine the ways in which you can customize Ghidra’s default
    appearance and behavior to better serve your reverse engineering needs.

    (fuzzy) distinction between the terms *plugin* and *tool*. In a general sense,
    the following is true:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Plugin** A plugin is a software component (for example, Byte Viewer, Listing
    window, and so on) that adds functionality to Ghidra. Plugins frequently present
    themselves as windows, but many plugins do their work behind the scenes (for example,
    analyzers).'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Tool** A tool can be a single plugin or a set of plugins that work together.
    They generally present as a useful graphical user interface (GUI) to help users
    accomplish tasks. A tool that we have been working with extensively, CodeBrowser,
    is a window that serves as a GUI framework. Function Graph is also a tool.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don’t panic if these definitions are not strictly adhered to. In many cases,
    distinguishing between the two simply doesn’t matter. For example, some menus,
    such as the Tool Options menu discussed later in this chapter, include options
    that can be applied to both tools and plugins despite using the term *Tool*. In
    that context, as well as many others, the distinction is not important, as both
    are treated the same. You should be able to successfully navigate the customization
    process even when the usage of the terms varies.

    the Options window. For example, key bindings are used to specify mappings between
    Ghidra actions and hotkey sequences, and there are over 550 actions in the default
    CodeBrowser window for which you can create or reassign a hotkey binding using
    the Options window. Hotkey reassignment is useful in many instances, including
    making additional commands available via hotkeys, changing default sequences to
    sequences that are easier to remember, and changing sequences that might conflict
    with others in use by the operating system or your terminal application. You might
    even remap all hotkeys to match those of other disassemblers.

    will ask you to choose a folder in which to save the tool and then create a *.tool*
    file containing your tool specification. To import a tool, use the Tools ▸ Import
    Tool option.

    the CodeBrowser by default, you can choose any tool in your Tool Chest by right-clicking
    the file and then choosing the tool from the context menu. Alternatively, you
    can drag the filename and drop it onto a tool.

- en: The more you use Ghidra, the more you will realize that there is no one-size-fits-all
    Ghidra interface that provides exactly the tools you need for each RE task you
    undertake. As a reverse engineer, the approach to analyzing a particular file
    largely depends on the file itself, the goal of the analysis, and the progress
    toward that goal.

    you might change Ghidra’s look and feel as well as the tools available to meet
    your needs. A final step in customizing Ghidra is the ability to save these configurations
    you have created so that you can choose the correct configuration based on the
    analysis project you are undertaking. This is accomplished through the creation
    and preservation of Ghidra workspaces.

    as they are currently configured and the associated files. Imagine that you are
    analyzing a binary. While you are looking at the file, you notice characteristics
    that are similar to another file you analyzed last week. You would like to compare
    the two files to identify the similarities between the two functions, but you
    also want to continue analyzing the file. These are two unique problems that have
    a file in common.

- en: One way to proceed down these two paths concurrently is to create a workspace
    associated with each analysis problem. You can preserve your current analysis
    by selecting Project ▸ Workspace ▸ Add from the Ghidra Project window and giving
    the new workspace a name. In this example, we will call this workspace *FileAnalysis*.
    You can then open another tool from the Tool Chest and perhaps compare the two
    files using a specialized tool that utilizes the *Diff View* (see [Chapter 23](ch23.xhtml#ch23)),
    then create a second workspace (*FileComparison*) using the same method. You can
    now easily switch between the workspaces by selecting the workspace in the pull-down
    menu shown in [Figure 12-22](ch12.xhtml#fig12_22) or by using the Switch option
    in the Project ▸ Workspace menu, which cycles you through the available workspaces.

- en: When starting out with Ghidra, you may be perfectly satisfied with its default
    behaviors and its default CodeBrowser layout. However, as you become more comfortable
    with Ghidra’s basic features, you are certain to find ways to customize Ghidra
    for your reverse engineering workflow. While there is no way for a single chapter
    to provide complete coverage of every possible option Ghidra offers, we have introduced
    and provided examples for the customization capabilities that you will most likely
    need at some point in your SRE experience. Discovering additional useful tools
    and options is left as a matter of exploration for inquisitive readers.

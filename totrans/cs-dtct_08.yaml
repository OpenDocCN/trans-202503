- en: The Port of Mudwall didn’t even live up to its unimpressive name. It wasn’t
    much of a port; the rickety wooden dock could fit no more than two modestly sized
    ships. The mudwall itself, in theory a 20-foot-tall earthen city wall, had never
    actually been constructed, and was only hinted at here and there with 2-foot-tall
    humps surrounding about a third of the city.

    with Notation and Socks trailing along behind him.

    outright delight with the progression of a powerful sneeze. He knocked a stack
    of carrot-themed tourist pamphlets off the counter as he hurried around to greet
    them.

    farms. What can I get for you? Food? Supplies? Carrots? Carrot-flavored baked
    goods? We have a simply wonderful carrot pie.”

    it used to be. Not since G’Raph started hosting its Mud Radish Festival. People
    would rather go there for the big-city atmosphere.”

    asked.
  prefs: []

    We’ve had a few donkey carts pass through on the coastal road. But no ships.”

    and it is very important that you tell us anything you might know about all ships
    that have come through here recently.”

    view of the dock from my window. Even if I hadn’t seen it, I would have heard
    about it. We don’t get many ships these days. People would’ve been all excited.
    The Sound of Carrots, our three-person marching band, usually greets each ship.
    I certainly would have heard them.”

    half the population, before admitting defeat. No one had seen a ship. No one had
    heard of anyone seeing a ship. And no one could even understand why a ship would
    visit. The port clearly didn’t receive much traffic.

    *TCP Flyer*. “They sent a small party ashore on a rowboat, handed off the documents,
    and left. Someone could have been waiting with a cart right here.” She pointed
    to an arbitrary plank on the dock, which didn’t look any more or less suspicious
    than its neighbors.

    Socks.

    why we use a backtracking search.”

    boy’s face, Frank added, “We keep exploring along the most promising direction
    until that trail hits a dead end. Then we backtrack to a previously unexplored,
    but promising, lead and search from there.”

    they failed to pick up a trail on Frayed Cable Island, he would be forced to follow
    one of their more tenuous leads. The colored threads from the cart were unique
    enough to be moderately promising.

    you ever have to backtrack in your work? What about while making a potion?”

    unadd spider legs or unstir the mixture.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    realize that it destroys the magical consistency or something? So you cross out
    that instruction and try a different approach the next time you mix the potion.
    Each recipe you try is a single state in your search space, and you backtrack
    by returning to the last good recipe.”

    caves. Although I have to point out that it would be difficult to tell if an object
    found was forgotten or not. I guess you could—”

- en: Almost every investigation will involve some backtracking. Even the best officers
    can’t always follow clues in a straight path from start to finish. The world is
    filled with useless information, ambigious clues, and red herrings. On top of
    that, you’ll make mistakes. So it’s important to know how to backtrack a search
    when you hit a dead end. Simply put, this means backing up your search to a previous
    state and trying a different option.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Up until this point, algorithms have been presented on search spaces where they
    can efficiently jump from any state to any other arbitrary state. For example,
    in an array, you can easily examine the value at any location using just its index.
    And in a hotel hallway, you can run between rooms. This flexibility provides efficiency
    for the algorithms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, many search spaces come with constraints on how you can move from state
    to state. If you are searching a castle in the physical world, you can’t jump
    arbitrarily between rooms—you have to traverse the halls and rooms in between.
    Similar constraints can apply in the computational realm for data structures like
    graphs or linked lists.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Even in cases where you can jump between states, it is often useful to picture
    backtracking as moving through previous states on your way to explore new states.
    In the algorithmic world, this can be significantly less costly than physically
    retracing your route. However, the processes are conceptually similar: you back
    up the search and proceed down a different avenue.'

    when they hit dead ends. And once you join the force, you’ll experience more dead
    ends than you ever imagined.

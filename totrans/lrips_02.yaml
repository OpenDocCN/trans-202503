- en: 'Laurie and Xor soon reached the little town of Bach. It was very confusing
    at first, because the name “Bach” appeared on everything: Bach Street, Bach Avenue,
    Bach Plaza—even the sidewalk was labeled *sidebach*. They finally found Bach Haus
    down Bach Way.'

    and an elegant coat answered. “Hello, what can I do for you?” she asked.
  prefs: []

- en: “Are you Eponymous Bach? I’m Laurie. I was told you can help me.”
  prefs: []

    in and have some tea.”

- en: The house was impressive on the outside, but on the inside it was a mess! Strange
    machines were shoved against the walls, cobwebs hung down from the corners, tools
    were scattered on the floor, and piles and piles of paper with scribbled notes
    were everywhere. A violin was stuffed into a flowerpot. Xor jumped out of Laurie’s
    pocket to hunt some insects.

- en: “I put little ideas together to make bigger ones. Then I put *those* ideas together
    to make bigger and bigger ones! And then I put my name on them. You shouldn’t
    let any ideas escape without a name,” she said. “That’s Bach’s First Law of Eponymy.
    I made it myself, you see.”
  prefs: []

- en: “Is that why all the streets are named after you?” Laurie asked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Yes, I used to put my name on Things. But it’s much better to have your name
    on an Idea. That’s my Second Law of Eponymy.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “But why is an idea better?” Laurie asked. “You can’t see an idea.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Because good ideas never wear out! You put your name on a birthday cake, but
    it doesn’t last very long, does it?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No. You eat it right away,” Laurie said. Birthday cakes don’t last long at
    all!

    falls down eventually. It makes a terrible noise, too! No, the best way to make
    something last forever is to take away everything but the ideas.” She pointed
    to a portrait of a man with curly hair and a funny coat. “Look over there,” she
    said.

    through two wires, they would bend a little toward each other. So he called it
    Andy’s Magical Wire Bender, and he went around selling it to people who make paper
    clips.”

- en: “That’s pretty neat!” said Laurie.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Yes, but I told Andy to keep going, to take away all of the Things until he
    had an Idea worth putting his name on. He realized he could use his machine to
    measure electricity by looking at how much the wires bent. That was truly new—a
    new law of nature. Nobody uses Andy’s Magical Wire Bender anymore, but Ampère’s
    Law will always be current.”

    Just try telling a story about turtles without using the word *turtle*.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Round animal with a Shell* instead of *turtle*.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    door to the back door by walking through the house, right?”
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the planet, to do the same thing. Many ways make sense, but only some are sensible.”

    around the planet!”

    is to find the shortest path home.”'

    Have you been there before?”

    at Recursion Junction.”

    “Do you know anything about how to find Steganosauruses?”

    don’t exist.”

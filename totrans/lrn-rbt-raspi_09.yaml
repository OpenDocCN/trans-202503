    This is the site you used to download your Raspberry Pi’s operating system at
    the start of the book. The Foundation’s website has a plethora of educational
    resources and projects for all levels and abilities. You’ll also find the Raspberry
    Pi forums, where you can sign up for an account and interact with other people
    with similar interests, problems, and questions; this is the perfect place to
    ask for help if you get stuck with a future project. There is even a dedicated
    section for “Automation, sensing, and robotics”! The site also includes a regularly
    updated blog featuring the latest news from the community.'

    While this book has given you a great introduction to coding and the Python programming
    language, if you want to continue to develop your programming skills, take a look
    at the official Python website. You’ll find all the documentation and guides you
    could possibly hope for! Further down the line, you may wish to explore other
    programming languages, such as C++ or Java, in which case simply search for tutorials
    on Google—there are quite literally millions!'

    nothing can replace face-to-face clubs, events, and meetups. Fortunately, you’ll
    find lots of opportunities for these in the computer science world. Here are some
    suggestions, but your location will affect what’s available to you, so make sure
    you find out what’s going on in your local area for clubs and events relevant

    Raspberry Jams are independently organized community events for people of all
    ages to chat, learn, and share projects based around the Raspberry Pi. Jams happen
    in every corner of the globe and are run by all sorts of people. Raspberry Jams
    often include workshops for beginners, show-and-tell, and talks given by members
    of the community. People from all backgrounds and abilities, from beginner to
    professional, are welcome at these events. Use the *Find a Jam Near You* tool
    on the website to locate one in your area. If you ever come to one of the Jams
    in Cambridge, UK, or an event in Edinburgh, UK, you’ll most likely find me there—please
    say hi!'

    challenge-based robotics competition for Raspberry Pi–controlled robots. Teams,
    both professional and amateur, build robots and then compete against each other
    in nondestructive tasks, such as obstacle courses, speed tests, and maze solving.
    It is usually held over a weekend and takes place in Cambridge, UK. You can go
    to the event as either a competitor or just a spectator; see the website for more

<h2 class="h2b" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div class="image1"><img src="Images/com.jpg" alt="Image" width="204" height="204"/></div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="big1">Our goal in writing this book is to provide a resource that introduces Ghidra to both current and future reverse engineers. In the hands of a skilled reverse engineer, Ghidra streamlines the analysis process and allows users to customize and extend its capabilities to suit their</span> individual needs and improve their workflows. Ghidra is also very accessible to new reverse engineers, particularly with its included decompiler that can help them more clearly understand the relationships between high-level language and disassembly listings as they begin exploring the world of binary analysis.</p>
<p class="indent">Writing a book about Ghidra is a challenging undertaking. Ghidra is a complex open source reverse engineering tool suite that is continually evolving. Our words describe a moving target, as the Ghidra community continues to improve and extend its capabilities. As with many new open source projects, Ghidra has begun its public life with a rapid string of evolutionary releases. A primary goal while writing this book has been to ensure that as Ghidra evolves, the book’s content continues to provide readers with a wide <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxii"/>and deep foundation of knowledge to understand and effectively utilize current and future Ghidra versions to address their reverse engineering challenges. As much as possible, we have tried to keep the book version-agnostic. Fortunately, new releases of Ghidra are well-documented, with detailed listings of changes that provide version-specific guidance should you encounter any differences between the book and your version of Ghidra.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev451"><strong>About This Book</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">This book is the first comprehensive book about Ghidra. It is intended to be an all-encompassing resource for reverse engineering with Ghidra. It provides introductory content to bring new explorers to the reverse engineering world, advanced content to extend the worldview of experienced reverse engineers, and examples for rookie and veteran Ghidra developers alike to continue to extend Ghidra’s extensive capabilities and become contributors to the Ghidra community.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev452"><strong>Who Should Read This Book?</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">This book is intended for aspiring and experienced software reverse engineers. If you don’t already have reverse engineering experience, that’s okay, as the early chapters provide the background material necessary to introduce you to reverse engineering and enable you to explore and analyze binaries with Ghidra. Experienced reverse engineers who want to add Ghidra to their toolkits might choose to move quickly through the first two parts to gain a basic understanding of Ghidra and then jump to specific chapters of interest. Experienced Ghidra users and developers may choose to focus on the later chapters so that they can create new Ghidra extensions and can apply their experience and knowledge to contribute new content to the Ghidra project.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev453"><strong>What’s in This Book?</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The book is divided into five parts. <a href="part01.xhtml#part01">Part I</a> introduces disassembly, reverse engineering, and the Ghidra project. <a href="part02.xhtml#part02">Part II</a> covers basic Ghidra usage. <a href="part03.xhtml#part03">Part III</a> demonstrates ways you can customize and automate Ghidra to make it work for you. <a href="part04.xhtml#part04">Part IV</a> takes a deeper dive into explaining specific types of Ghidra modules and supporting concepts. <a href="part05.xhtml#part05">Part V</a> demonstrates how Ghidra can be applied to some real-world situations a reverse engineer is likely to encounter.</p>

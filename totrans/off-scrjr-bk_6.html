 <strong>AFTERWORD</strong>
</h2>
<p class="noindent">Even though you’ve reached the end of the book, you are only just getting started with programming. The goal of this book is to guide you in helping the children in your life learn programming—and, <a id="page_126"></a>
 in the process, learn to design projects, solve problems, reason systematically, and express themselves creatively.</p>
<p class="indent">When your child has mastered all that ScratchJr has to offer, it might be time to introduce Scratch and its active online community. In <a href="text00012.html#app01">Appendix A</a>
 , you will find resources for this transition.</p>
<p class="indent">We have worked hard to bring coding to young children in a developmentally appropriate way. It is our strong belief that programming opens new ways of thinking and new forms of expression. We hope to continue making improvements to ScratchJr and creating new resources and opportunities for learning and sharing. We want ScratchJr to remain free so anyone, anywhere, can use it. So far, we have been able to do so through generous grants from the National Science Foundation and the Scratch Foundation. If you believe in our vision and want to support us, please consider making a donation to the Scratch Foundation (<em>
<a href="http://www.scratchfoundation.org/">http://www.scratchfoundation.org/</a>
</em>
 ). Any amount, large or small, is appreciated.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s keep coding!</p>

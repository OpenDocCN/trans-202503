    can now impact the lives of millions of people by targeting elections, power grids,
    and all sorts of infrastructure that people rely on for their day-to-day activities,

    hacking but also encourage it. *Ethical Hacking* is an excellent manual for programmers
    who want to learn the fundamentals of designing hacking tools, as well as how
    to implement the various techniques used by professional penetration testers.
    To get you there, the book guides you through a lab setup and many exercises that
    will equip you with skills you’ll need.

    hacks at the corporate level, it also offers an amazing scope, and so is an ideal
    textbook for a security course at the undergraduate or graduate level. I consider
    this book’s lessons necessary for current and future technology, policy, and leadership
    professionals.

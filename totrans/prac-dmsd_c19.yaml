    they wouldn’t look out of place in any normal home. There’s nothing odd about
    owning a first-aid kit or keeping a well-stocked pantry, and this holds true whether
    you’re a young urban techie or the proprietor of a sprawling rural homestead.'

    attract some scrutiny. A barrel of water in the backyard or a portable generator
    in the garage might be unremarkable in some parts of the country, but in some
    times and places, these items would stand out like a sore thumb. But then, the
    worst-case outcome is having to acknowledge in passing that you’re prepared for
    snowstorms, earthquakes, or hurricanes; there’s no need to go off the deep end
    and bring up monetary system collapses or EMPs.

    items and survival gear with a bit more courage, examining a wider selection of
    supplies that may come in handy during disasters but that could invite probing
    questions if kept in plain view. Your chances of getting grilled by friends or
    relatives will vary: a pry bar in your garage may make perfect sense if you just
    finished remodeling a deck, but will look out of place if your proudest DIY accomplishment
    is hanging a picture on the wall. The bottom line is that as you accumulate more
    equipment, you might eventually have to come out as a full-fledged survivalist—and
    if you want to keep your friendships, you’ll need to be careful not to bring up
    extraterrestrials or zombies on day one.'

    to razor-sharp “self-defense” pens. It’s best not to be distracted by such knock-off

    or tree limbs blocking the way. Under normal circumstances, it’s possible to call
    a pro, but if the damage is more widespread—such as in the wake of a severe storm—wait
    times for roofers or city services may be measured in days or weeks. In the meantime,
    it may be up to you and your neighbors to keep your surroundings habitable and
    safe.

    just on expedient repairs to damaged windows and doors: a heavy-duty tarp, construction
    nails or screws, and a couple of planks should do the trick. For owners of single-family
    homes, especially in areas with tall trees, another worthwhile purchase may be
    a good chainsaw, along with the requisite protective wear, chain oil and sharpener,
    and a modicum of safety knowledge to avoid gruesome injuries.'

- en: For a complete set of chainsaw precautions, it’s best to turn to the manual
    or to the safety videos published by the manufacturer. That said, when dealing
    with trees, one of the most important points is that wood is surprisingly elastic
    and that limbs can be under considerable tension—especially if propped against
    vehicles, nearby structures, or other trees. Many chainsaw incidents involve people
    getting knocked off ladders, whacked on the head, or pinned down when a tree snaps
    back or shifts unexpectedly during a cut.

- en: Another significant danger is the kickback from the saw itself, common when
    the tip of the chain bar makes contact with uncut material at an angle of 90°
    or less. This can cause the chainsaw to be propelled toward the operator with
    considerable force, sometimes producing gnarly cuts on the forehead or the extremities.
    Finally, it’s also possible to carelessly lower the chainsaw before the chain
    comes to a complete stop, potentially causing leg injury.

    also known as a *come-along*: a simple ratcheting mechanism that, when coupled
    with tow straps and a sturdy anchor point, can be used to effortlessly move very
    heavy objects such as uprooted trees or disabled cars. Power pullers come in several
    varieties, typically rated between two and five tons; in most situations, a two-ton
    model should do.'

    dismantling partly collapsed wooden structures or forcing open windows and doors
    to get to people in need. Finally, a lightweight extension ladder, a pair of sturdy
    shoes, and some cut-resistant gloves are almost always good to have on hand—not
    just for disasters, but for all-around home maintenance work.

    it can be difficult to get help. Skidding off the road in a major blizzard or
    hitting road debris and getting a flat tire in the wake of a hurricane may mean
    waiting for hours, if not more, before a tow truck shows up. On a rural road with
    little or no traffic and with spotty cell coverage, getting timely assistance
    may be quite a feat even on a good day.

    sparsely populated areas, it’s a good plan to carry the essentials needed to spend
    the night in the car. That said, in many other situations, getting back on the
    road is possible if you carry the right tools. The most familiar roadside problem
    is a flat tire. In some cases, this can be dealt with by using tire plugs, a portable
    compressor, or a Fix-a-Flat type of product containing a sealant in a can—but
    such solutions don’t work for blowouts or major damage to the sidewalls. A more
    reliable solution is to pull out the spare tire, along with a lug wrench and a
    scissor jack. Unfortunately, about a third of new vehicles no longer come with
    a spare, at least not unless you pay extra;^([1](b02.xhtml#c19-endnote-1)) it’s
    also not uncommon for secondhand cars to miss some of the accessories or come
    with a spare that’s in poor shape. It pays to check.

    trying to start the car. At times, getting stranded after a brief stop would be
    unpleasant or even dangerous, and on such trips, it makes sense to carry jumper
    cables or a battery-powered jump starter, especially if the car is several years
    old. That said, I’d advise against keeping a jump starter in the car at all times:
    vehicles parked on the street get extremely hot in the summer, and this doesn’t
    bode well for the lithium-ion chemistry inside.'

    if the roads are well maintained in your part of the woods, the chains come in
    handy if the car skids off the road. For the same reason, carrying a tow strap
    and road flares may be advisable. To deal with electrical malfunctions, it’s also
    good to carry a selection of fuses and spare lamps; once again, these are often
    supplied with the vehicle, but it’s best to double-check. Older vehicles can be
    more temperamental, so some drivers carry everything from extra motor oil, to
    radiator sealants, to replacement serpentine belts. This isn’t always necessary,
    but if you know of any recurring issues with your car, it’s smart to plan ahead.

    unable to open the doors or operate the power windows. Such accidents aren’t common
    in real life—and when they do happen, the casualties tend to involve people who
    are unconscious or pinned down. That said, if having a way to break tempered glass
    would give you some peace of mind, one of the cheapest and most reliable choices
    is an *automatic center punch*: a simple spring-loaded device that, if pressed
    against side windows, should shatter them without fail.'

- en: Car repair and storm cleanup are two excellent examples of activities that are
    aided by the purchase of specialized tools, but as before, it pays to think about
    any other equipment that may be needed to round out your emergency plan. For example,
    a quick walk-through of your home may identify a need for spare fuses, filter
    cartridges, or other consumables required to operate furnaces, well pumps, and
    other critical machinery.

    leaky faucets, to poorly adjusted doors, to stubborn water shutoff valves.

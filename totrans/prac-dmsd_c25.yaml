    the sanctity of the backyard tool shed and the sanctity of life—but as far as
    the law goes, the two are nothing alike. So, before we go further into this last
    section of the book, let’s talk about something that technically *isn’t* self-defense:
    safeguarding one’s property from destruction or theft.'

- en: To the best of my knowledge, in most of the world, people have the right to
    use a degree of force to protect their belongings. But almost everywhere, this
    force is more limited than what can be used to defend yourself or your loved ones,
    or to protect the lives of strangers on the street. Given the legal peril and
    inherent risk of injury that comes with trying to be a hero, one school of thought
    instructs victims of property crime to simply avoid confrontation and accept their
    fate.

    victims may fare better in the short haul, but over time, their behavior emboldens
    the crooks. The decision to pursue, detain, or fight a thief is never as simple
    as a blog post or a book makes it out to be, but it’s best to make the call with
    a clarity of purpose and a solid understanding of the risk.'

- en: Broadly speaking, the force you can use in the protection of your possessions
    must be reasonable. You might be able to push a mugger aside, forcibly grab what
    they’re holding, or detain them until the cops arrive—but if you intentionally
    or recklessly cause great bodily injury, you would almost certainly be crossing
    the line. In a handful of jurisdictions, deadly force may be permissible to stop
    the commission of certain specifically enumerated property crimes, but about the
    only universally sound defense for causing death or severe injury is that you
    reasonably feared for your own or somebody else’s life—and that the perceived
    threat was imminent and not of your own doing.^([1](b02.xhtml#c25-endnote-1))

    legends, it’s unlawful to shoot trespassers in the absence of serious aggravating
    factors, and this holds true in Texas as much as it does in California or in Japan.
    In fact, as noted earlier, in many jurisdictions even pointing a weapon at a stranger
    or displaying it in a menacing way may be a big legal faux pas if you aren’t protecting
    a life.

- en: Of course, sometimes property-related confrontations spiral out of control.
    If a trespasser starts beating you to a pulp or pulls out a knife, you’re now
    in a self-defense situation and might be justified in using any force necessary
    to stop the assault. On the flip side, if you chase down a fleeing burglar and
    get too carried away dispensing your own brand of justice, you might find yourself
    in trouble—and that’s no matter how big your locality is on property rights.

    Any covert device that causes harm to trespassers or burglars could make you liable
    for their injuries or even land you in jail. Some exceptions apply: when an intruder
    knowingly takes a stupid risk and gets hurt (say, climbing over barbed wire),
    or if a freak accident takes place and a burglar is injured by a device not actually
    meant to be a trap, you should be in the clear in most parts of the world. But
    the line is thin. If you build a gator-filled moat and post a sign that reads
    “BEWARE OF GATORS,” for instance, you might still be liable if a child falls in
    or gets snatched by one of your reptilian friends.'

- en: Because the right to defend your property is constrained, and because you’re
    not always there to defend it in the first place, it’s generally better to heed
    the advice in Chapter 10 and focus on deterrence and hassle-free outcomes, rather
    than let everything hinge on the outcome of a fight. Dogs, alarm systems, and
    properly working locks can deter many criminals. Being smart about where you keep
    valuables can limit the losses if burglars get in too.

- en: Another loss-minimization strategy worth mentioning is a well-tailored homeowner’s
    or renter’s insurance policy. Many less common valuables, such as a prized Mr.
    Potato Head collection, may not be covered to any appreciable extent unless explicitly
    itemized on a so-called *floater* attached to the insurance paperwork. Mr. Potato
    Head memorabilia aside, more popular items such as furs, watches, jewelry, precious
    metals, musical instruments, cash, and firearms are frequently subject to steep
    coverage restrictions that will saddle you with the bulk of the loss if the valuables
    aren’t itemized on the policy.

- en: In general, many home insurance companies aren’t particularly keen on insuring
    unusual or high-value items and may try to scare you away with mounds of paperwork,
    appraisal requirements, or exorbitant quotes. An insurance company specializing
    in collectibles, such as Collectibles Insurance Services ([https://collectinsure.com/](https://collectinsure.com/)),
    may be a more willing partner in such pursuits.

    Even if you aren’t the type to grab a shotgun and chase them away, such knowledge
    can give you options, such as calling a friend or dialing 911, rather than being
    accosted when taking out the trash.

- en: The desire to maintain an awareness of one’s surroundings drives many preppers
    to explore all sorts of perimeter security devices. The two most common examples
    are passive infrared (PIR) motion sensors or cameras around the home. All too
    often, such solutions become a distraction; for example, in wooded areas, deer
    and other wildlife will cause frequent alerts, especially in the middle of the
    night. In the suburbs, squirrels, raccoons, dogs, and neighbors’ kids are bound
    to give the concerned homeowner headaches as well. Achieving complete coverage
    and ample advance notice of a threat is difficult. That said, the technology can
    still work when deployed more judiciously and on a limited scale. A motion sensor
    overlooking a section of the driveway that’s pruned of vegetation, and another
    device guarding a seldom-used backyard gate, will probably cause relatively few
    nuisance alarms.

    no business in your driveway, another approach is to make their entry into the
    home as slow and as noticeable as possible. Simple solutions shouldn’t be discounted.
    Keeping the doors and backyard gates locked is often enough; prickly bushes can
    also be surprisingly effective, especially around any street-level windows that
    would otherwise be easy to pry open or smash.

    properly, this transparent material keeps the glass in place even if the window
    is hit with a rock. Compared to window bars or security shutters, the film is
    much cheaper and less unsightly—and is probably as far as a typical household
    would ever need to go, given that a truly determined intruder can always cut or
    even simply punch a hole through the siding and the drywall of a typical stick-frame
    home.

    disciplines. The earliest computer-related forensics work began during the 1980s,
    when practitioners were almost exclusively from law enforcement or military organizations.
    During the 1980s, the growth of home computers and dial-up BBS services triggered
    early interest in computer forensics within law enforcement communities. In 1984,
    the FBI developed a pioneering program to analyze computer evidence. In addition,
    the increase in abuse and internet-based attacks led to the creation of the Computer
    Emergency Response Team (CERT) in 1988\. CERT was formed by the Defense Advanced
    Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and is located at Carnegie Mellon University
    in Pittsburgh.

    home became commonplace. During this time, computer forensics was a major topic
    among law enforcement agencies. In 1993, the FBI hosted the first of multiple
    international conferences on computer evidence for law enforcement, and in 1995,
    the International Organization of Computer Evidence (IOCE) was formed and began
    making recommendations for standards. The concept of “computer crime” had become
    a reality, not just in the United States but internationally. In 1999, the Association
    of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) created a good practice guide for UK law enforcement
    personnel who handled computer-based evidence. Also during the late 1990s, the
    first open source forensic software, The Coroner’s Toolkit, was created by Dan
    Farmer and Wietse Venema.

    forensics. The tragedy of September 11, 2001, had a tremendous impact on how the
    world viewed security and incident response. The Enron and Anderson accounting
    scandals led to the creation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States, designed
    to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures.
    This act required organizations to have formal incident response and investigation
    processes, typically including some form of digital forensics or evidence collection
    capability. The growth of intellectual property (IP) concerns also had an impact
    on civilian organizations. Internet fraud, phishing, and other IP- and brand-related
    incidents created further demand for investigation and evidence gathering. Peer-to-peer
    file sharing (starting with Napster), along with the arrival of digital copyright
    legislation in the form of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), led to
    increased demand for investigating digital copyright violation.

    As of this writing, consumer hard disks can store 10TB of data. The availability
    of easy-to-use RAID appliances has pushed logical disk capacity to even greater
    sizes. These large disk capacities challenge traditional forensic lab acquisition
    processes.

    scenes or involved in incidents. What used to be a single computer for a household
    has become a colorful array of computers, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, external
    disks, USB thumb drives, memory cards, CDs and DVDs, and other devices that store
    significant amounts of data. The challenge is actually finding and seizing all
    the relevant storage media, as well as acquiring images in a manner that makes
    everything simultaneously accessible to forensic analysis tools.

    In some cases, only cached copies of data might remain on end user devices, with
    the bulk of the data residing with cloud service providers. Collecting this data
    can be complicated for law enforcement if it resides outside a legal jurisdiction,
    and difficult for private organizations when outsourced cloud providers have no
    forensic support provisions in their service contract.

    forensics community as well. The multitude of little internet-enabled electronic
    gadgets (health monitors, clocks, environmental displays, security camera devices,
    and so on) typically don’t contain large amounts of storage. But they might contain
    useful telemetry data, such as timestamps, location and movement data, environmental
    conditions, and so forth. Identifying and accessing this data will eventually
    become a standard part of forensic evidence collection.

    the trend toward proprietary, locked-down devices. Personal computer architectures
    and disk devices have historically been open and well documented, allowing for
    the creation of standard forensic tools to access the data. However, the increased
    use of proprietary software and hardware makes this innovation difficult. This
    is especially problematic in the mobile device space, where devices may need to
    be *jail broken* (effectively hacked into) before lower-level filesystem block
    access is possible.

    via an outsourcing partner in country D and exfiltrates the stolen data to a drop
    zone in country E. In this scenario, five different countries are involved, meaning
    the potential coordination of five different law enforcement agencies, engaging
    at least five different companies, across five different legal jurisdictions.

    partners to combat criminal activity in public-private partnerships (PPPs). This
    multifaceted cooperation creates opportunities to identify, collect, and transfer
    digital evidence. The challenge here is ensuring that private partners understand

**GRADIENTS**

![Image](graphics/common-01.jpg)

In this chapter, the last of the quartet about decorative properties, I cover CSS gradients. A *gradient* in this context is the gradual transition between two or more colors—a design standard for many years and one that you might think would be fairly simple to translate into CSS, but which has a long and tortured history on the Web.

CSS gradients were first introduced in WebKit in 2008 and made their way into Safari 4\. The syntax they used, however, was completely different from the one you’ll see in the rest of this chapter and was deemed too complex by other browser vendors. Various other proposals were put forward (and even implemented) throughout the following years, until a final syntax was agreed on at the end of 2011\. This final syntax was rapidly adopted by all browsers, and it’s the one I’ll cover in this chapter. (Read “[Browser Support and Legacy Syntaxes](ch15.html#ch15leve1sec205)” on [page 131](ch11.html#page_131) to learn how to support older versions in legacy browsers.)

**WARNING** *Graphical effects like gradients can be quite computationally taxing and will slow the rendering and performance of pages, especially in mobile browsers. That’s not to say you should avoid them, just that you should always evaluate performance against appearance when building your sites.*

### **Linear Gradients**

A *linear gradient* is one that gradually transitions between colors over the length of a straight line connecting two points. At its simplest, a linear gradient changes proportionally between two colors along the full length of the line.

I’ll begin by showing the shortest possible syntax for a linear gradient, which is defined using the `linear-gradient()` value function on the `background-image` property:

```
E { background-image: linear-gradient(black, white); }
```

[Figure 11-1](ch11.html#ch11fig1) shows the result.

![Image](graphics/f11-01.jpg)

*Figure 11-1: A simple top-bottom, two-color linear gradient*

Each color that you want the gradient to pass through is known as a *color-stop* and is passed into the function in a comma-separated list of arguments. As you can see here, gradients require at least two color-stops: a start and an end. In this example, the gradient begins black and ends white, passing gradually through all the intermediate shades between the two values.

#### ***Setting Gradient Direction***

The axis between the first and last color-stops is known as the *gradient line*. In the previous example, the gradient line begins at the top of the box and moves to the bottom, vertically. This is the default direction. To set a different gradient line, specify a target side or corner of the box by passing a new argument into the function before the list of color-stops. The argument is a string of keywords, beginning with `to` and followed by one or two direction keywords. For example, to define a black-to-white gradient running bottom to top, you use this value:

```
E { background-image: linear-gradient(to top, black, white); }
```

To change the same gradient to run diagonally from the top-left corner to the bottom-right one, you use two directional keywords:

```
E { background-image: linear-gradient(to right bottom, black, white); }
```

For finer control over the direction of the gradient line, you can use an angle argument instead of the directional keywords. Angles can be declared using various units—in this chapter, I’ll stick with degrees (`deg`) because they’re the most commonly understood, but see “Angle Units” on [page 124](ch11.html#page_124) for more about alternative units.

The angle value sets the angle of the gradient line: `0deg` (or `360deg`) goes from bottom to top, `45deg` from bottom left to top right, `90deg` from left to right, and so on. Negative values make the gradient go counterclockwise: -`45deg` is the same as `315deg`, -`315deg` is the same as `45deg`, and so on. You get the idea.

For example, to create the same top-left to bottom-right gradient as in the previous code example, but using an angle value, you would use this code:

```
E { background-image: linear-gradient(135deg, black, white); }
```

The next code snippet shows three examples of the effects of different direction values: the first from right to left, the second from bottom left to top right, and the last an angle of 120 degrees (roughly, but not quite, top left to bottom right).

```
E { background-image: linear-gradient(to left, black, white); }
E { background-image: linear-gradient(to top right, black, white); }
E { background-image: linear-gradient(120deg, black, white); }
```

[Figure 11-2](ch11.html#ch11fig2) shows the results.

![Image](graphics/f11-02.jpg)

*Figure 11-2: Three different direction values: left to right, bottom left to top right, and 120 degrees*

#### ***Adding Extra Color-Stop Values***

So far I’ve used a simple gradient with only two color-stops, but you can use more. (Because this book is printed in black and white, I’m limited by the palette that I can choose!) Each color you add is declared by simply adding a new color-stop in the comma-separated list, as in this example where I add a third black color-stop:

```
E { background-image: linear-gradient(black, white, black); }
```

**ANGLE UNITS**

A variety of angle units, used to represent angular measurement, are defined in the CSS3 Values and Units Module (*[http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#angle/](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#angle/)*). The unit that most of us learn in school is degrees (`deg`), where a full circle has 360 degrees, and this is the unit I use throughout this chapter. Of the alternatives, one is gradians (`grad`), which are measured on a scale where a full turn around a circle is equal to 400 gradians. Another, radians (`rad`), is based on π (pi), where a full circle is 2π radians, or approximately 6.2832rad. Still another unit is the `turn`, where one full circle is equal to 1 turn, although as of this writing only Firefox and Internet Explorer 9+ support this.

[Table 11-1](ch11.html#ch11table1) shows some equivalent values of the different angle units.

**Table 11-1:** Equivalent Angle Values

| **Degrees** | **Gradians** | **Radians** | **Turns** |
| 60 | 66.66667 | 1.04720 | 0.16667 |
| 90 | 100 | 1.5708 | 0.25 |
| 240 | 266.66667 | 4.18879 | 0.66667 |

As you can see, degrees tend to provide the cleanest and most familiar values, so unless you’re doing something very mathematically specific, like calculus, you’ll usually use degrees.

The color-stops are processed in the order listed, so this example creates a gradient that goes from black to white then back to black. [Figure 11-3](ch11.html#ch11fig3) shows the result.

![Image](graphics/f11-03.jpg)

*Figure 11-3: A gradient with three color-stops*

Color-stops are evenly distributed along the length of the gradient, so, in this case, the white color-stop is exactly halfway between the two blacks, at the middle point of the gradient. You can alter this distribution by adding a length or percentage value after each color-stop to shift the point along the gradient line where a color-stop is positioned. For example, this code positions the white color-stop at 75 percent of the length of the gradient line:

```
E { background-image: linear-gradient(black, white 75%, black); }
```

[Figure 11-4](ch11.html#ch11fig4) shows the result. Compare it to [Figure 11-3](ch11.html#ch11fig3) where no position is defined, and you’ll see that the white color-stop has moved further along the gradient line toward the bottom of the element.

![Image](graphics/f11-04.jpg)

*Figure 11-4: The second color-stop occurs three-quarters (or 75 percent) of the way down the length of the gradient.*

You’re not limited to using only percentage values on color-stops; length values are also permitted. This next snippet shows three ways to use length and percentage values, with the result shown in [Figure 11-5](ch11.html#ch11fig5). I’ll walk through each after the code.

```
➊ div { background-image: linear-gradient(to right, black, white 75%); }
➋ div { background-image: linear-gradient(to right, black 50%, white); }
➌ div { background-image: linear-gradient(to right, black, white 50%, black 1px); }
```

![Image](graphics/f11-05.jpg)

*Figure 11-5: Using different position values in the color-stops*

In ➊, the final color-stop argument has a position of 75 percent so the color-stop begins there and continues as a solid color until the end. In ➋, the first color-stop has the position value, so a solid block of the inherited color (black) is displayed until the 50 percent mark of the gradient line, at which point the gradient begins to transition to the final color-stop value.

Finally, ➌ has three color-stops. The second begins at 50 percent, so the first and second color-stops transition up to that point. The final color-stop is placed just one pixel farther along the gradient line, so there is a sudden shift to that color (with no transition) and the color continues to the end.

#### ***Repeating Linear Gradients***

Rather than create only a single gradient from one side of an element to another, you can repeat the same gradient until the element is filled using the `repeating-linear-gradient()` function. This function accepts the same fundamental set of values as `linear-gradient` except that a length or percentage value is required for the final color-stop. Here’s an example:

```
E { background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(white, black 25%); }
```

This final color-stop value sets the point at which the gradient should end and then start repeating. This code creates a top-bottom gradient (the default) between white and black that covers 25 percent of the height of the box, meaning it repeats four times, as shown in [Figure 11-6](ch11.html#ch11fig6).

![Image](graphics/f11-06.jpg)

*Figure 11-6: A white-to-black repeating gradient*

The next code examples use different values; [Figure 11-7](ch11.html#ch11fig7) shows the result, and I’ll explain each, in turn, after you’ve had a chance to look at the code.

```
➊ .gradient-1 {
      background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(to left, black, white, black 25%);
  }
➋ .gradient-2 {
      background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(45deg, black, white 2px, black 10px);
  }
➌ .gradient-3 {
      background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(315deg, black, black 2px, white 2px, white 4px);
  }
```

![Image](graphics/f11-07.jpg)

*Figure 11-7: Different repeating linear gradients*

• The first example (➊) uses three color-stops and sets the direction so the gradient goes from right to left. The gradient covers 25 percent of the element, so the black-white-black pattern is repeated four times.

• The second example (➋) uses an angle value of `45deg` so the gradient is diagonal and uses pixel units for the color-stops. Again the gradients are black-white-black, but they’re distributed unequally so the black-white covers 2px, whereas the white-black covers 8px.

• The last example (➌) uses four color-stops: black-black over 2px and then white-white over 2px. The low length values prevent a gradual change between the two colors, creating the hard diagonal lines you see here.

### **Radial Gradients**

A *radial gradient* is a gradual transition between colors that moves out from a central point in all directions. At its simplest, a radial gradient gradually changes between two colors in a circular or elliptical shape. Radial gradients are defined with the `radial-gradient()` value function, and, as with linear gradients, the simplest way to create one is to pass two color values in as arguments:

```
E { background-image: radial-gradient(white, black); }
```

This results in a simple, two-color, white-black gradient in an ellipse that extends to the farthest corner of its parent element, as shown in [Figure 11-8](ch11.html#ch11fig8).

![Image](graphics/f11-08.jpg)

*Figure 11-8: A simple two-color radial gradient*

#### ***Using Radial Gradients***

You can set the shape of a radial gradient by adding a keyword before the color-stops. The default is `ellipse`, but you can use the alternative `circle` like this:

```
E { background-image: radial-gradient(circle, white, black); }
```

The result shown in [Figure 11-9](ch11.html#ch11fig9) is more circular than [Figure 11-8](ch11.html#ch11fig8), although lacking a clearly defined edge. (You’ll learn how to set the extent of a radial gradient shortly.)

![Image](graphics/f11-09.jpg)

*Figure 11-9: A circular radial gradient*

The default center of a radial gradient (from which the gradient radiates) is at the center of the element it’s applied to. You can change this point by adding a position argument to the `radial-gradient()` function. The values used to set this position are exactly the same as those used in `background-position`—that is, a length, percentage, or keywords. You add the position after the shape keyword (`circle`, in the example shown here), preceded by the word `at`. The position is set to the center-right of the element:

```
E { background-image: radial-gradient(circle at 100% 50%, white, black); }
```

You can also set the *extent* of a gradient—that is, the point where the gradient ends—using a length or position value or one of four extent keywords. The extent argument is placed immediately after the shape keyword. For example, this code creates a circular gradient, the extent of which is 50px, meaning it finishes 50px from the center point:

```
E { background-image: radial-gradient(circle 50px, black, white); }
```

The four possible keywords that you can use when setting the extent are `closest-corner`, `closest-side`, `farthest-corner` (the default), and `farthest-side`. The next listing illustrates the differences among the keywords, with the result of each line shown in [Figure 11-10](ch11.html#ch11fig10). I’ll discuss each rule in turn.

```
➊ .ext1 { background-image: radial-gradient(closest-corner circle at 10% 60%, white, black); }
➋ .ext2 { background-image: radial-gradient(closest-side circle at 10% 60%, white, black); }
➌ .ext3 { background-image: radial-gradient(farthest-corner circle at 0% 100%, white, black,
  white, black); }
➍ .ext4 { background-image: radial-gradient(farthest-side circle at 0% 100%, white, black,
  white, black); }
```

![Image](graphics/f11-10.jpg)

*Figure 11-10: Comparing extent keywords for radial gradients*

All four gradients produce the same circular shape. In examples ➊ and ➋, both gradients have the same center position and color-stops, but the extent of ➊ is set by the `closest-corner` keyword, making the extent of the gradient be the closest corner (the bottom left), whereas the extent of ➋ is the closest side (left, set with `closest-side`), so this second circle is much smaller than the previous one.

The gradients in examples ➌ and ➍ have the same center position (the bottom-left corner of the element) and each has four color-stop values (alternating black-white). The extent of example ➌ is the farthest corner (top-right, set with `farthest-corner`), whereas example ➍ has an extent of the farthest side (the right, and you’ve probably guessed by now that it’s set with `farthest-side`). Although subtle, you should be able to see that the extent of ➍ is more limited than that of ➌.

#### ***Using Multiple Color-Stop Values***

As with their linear counterparts, radial gradients can accept multiple color-stop values and length or percentage values for positioning control. Any such qualifiers are entered in a comma-separated list. The four examples in the following listing demonstrate some interesting variations. [Figure 11-11](ch11.html#ch11fig11) shows the results of each line.

```
➊ .gradient-1 { background-image: radial-gradient(farthest-side circle, black, white, black); }
➋ .gradient-2 { background-image: radial-gradient(farthest-side circle, black, white 25%,
  Because gradients are applied wiblack); }
➌ .gradient-3 { background-image: radial-gradient(farthest-side circle at left, white,
  black 25%, white 75%, black); }
➍ .gradient-4 { background-image: radial-gradient(circle closest-side circle at 40% 50%,
  white, white 25%, black 50%, white 75%, black); }
```

![Image](graphics/f11-11.jpg)

*Figure 11-11: Different color-stop values for radial gradients*

In example ➊, I’ve created a gradient with three color-stops (black-white-black) that radiates from the center of the box to its farthest side. The example at ➋ is similar, except that the color-stop begins at 25 percent along the length of the radius.

In example ➌, the gradient begins at the left side of the box and ends at the right side, with color-stops at 25 and 75 percent of the length. The example at ➍ uses five colors, but by specifying both the first and second color-stops to use the same color I’ve created the solid-white circle in the center.

#### ***Repeating Radial Gradients***

Just as the `linear-gradient()` function has `repeating-linear-gradient()`, a `repeating-radial-gradient()` can be used to repeat the supplied arguments until the limit specified in the final color-stop is reached. For example, the following code creates a circular gradient that repeats black-white every 20 percent until its extent is reached. The result is displayed in [Figure 11-12](ch11.html#ch11fig12).

```
E { background-image: repeating-radial-gradient(circle, black, white 20%); }
```

![Image](graphics/f11-12.jpg)

*Figure 11-12: A repeating radial gradient*

For some further demonstrations of what you can do with repeating radial gradients, see the next block of code. The result is shown in [Figure 11-13](ch11.html#ch11fig13).

```
➊ .gradient-1 { background-image: repeating-radial-gradient(circle farthest-corner at right top,
  black, white 10%, black 15%); }
➋ .gradient-2 { background-image: repeating-radial-gradient(circle farthest-corner at left,
  white, white 10px, black 15px); }
➌ .gradient-3 { background-image: repeating-radial-gradient(circle farthest-corner, white,
  black 1px, white 2px); }
```

![Image](graphics/f11-13.jpg)

*Figure 11-13: Patterns created with repeating radial gradients*

The example at ➊ radiates from the top-right corner and passes through three color-stops over 15 percent of the box width, with the limit set by the `farthest-corner` keyword. In example ➋, I set the center of the gradient to the left side of the box and the limit to the farthest corner, using a white-white (solid) gradient for 10px and then a white-black gradient for 5px. Finally, with example ➌, I seem to have created a work of art! A white-black-white gradient repeats over a very low radius of 2px, creating the interference pattern you see here.

**BROWSER SUPPORT AND LEGACY SYNTAXES**

Although gradients have a checkered history, the good news is that the final syntax is well implemented by web browsers. Chrome, Firefox, IE10+, Safari 7+ (including Mobile), and Android 4.4+ support all of the properties without a vendor prefix.

Older versions of WebKit (included in Safari 5 to 6.1 and Android 4.0 to 4.3) support a transitional syntax for linear gradients, in which the gradient direction is defined by where it comes *from* instead of where it goes *to.* This rule uses the `-webkit-` prefix. The following listing compares the old, transitional rule with the final one; the output from both is the same.

```
.old { background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(left center, black,
white); }
.new { background-image: linear-gradient(to right center, black, white); }
```

If you need to support still older versions of WebKit (Android 3.0 and iOS 4.3 and earlier), you’ll meet the original syntax, which was rejected by other browser vendors for being too complex. In this original syntax, both linear and radial gradients are defined with the `gradient()` value function, with differing arguments. This listing shows the simplest linear and radial gradient possible with this old syntax:

```
E { background-image: -webkit-gradient(linear, 50% 0, 50% 100%,
from(black), to(white)); }
E { background-image: -webkit-gradient(radial, 50% 50%, 0, 50% 50%, 100,
from(black), to(white)); }
```

Honestly, it would take too long to explain what’s going on here, especially for the radial syntax. My best advice is to not even consider using this original syntax and instead to provide a graceful fallback to a solid background color or an image instead. You’ll save yourself a lot of heartache that way.

### **Multiple Gradients**

Because gradients are applied with the `background-image` property, you can use CSS3’s multiple background values’ syntax (see [Chapter 8](ch08.html#ch08)) to apply multiple gradients to an element using comma-separated values. This next listing shows two examples. The first uses linear gradients; the second uses radial gradients. [Figure 11-14](ch11.html#ch11fig14) shows the results of each example.

```
.linears {
  background-image:
  linear-gradient(to right bottom, black, white 50%, transparent 50%),
  linear-gradient(to left bottom, black, white 50%, black 50%);
}
.radials {
  background-image:
  radial-gradient(closest-side circle at 20% 50%, white, black 95%, transparent),
  radial-gradient(closest-side circle at 50% 50%, white, black 95%, transparent),
  radial-gradient(closest-side circle at 80% 50%, white, black 95%, transparent);
}
```

![Image](graphics/f11-14.jpg)

*Figure 11-14: Multiple gradient background values*

The example at left shows two linear gradients applied to an element: from top left to bottom right, and from top right to bottom left. The final color-stop has a value of `transparent` to allow the second gradient to show through below it. (Remember, if you don’t set transparency, the gradient will fill the rest of the box and hide the layer below it.) The example at right shows three radial gradients, each of which extends to the closest side, with the center of each at a different point. As with the first example, the last color-stop has a value of `transparent` to allow the layers below to show through.

### **Summary**

For all the historical problems with CSS gradients, the final syntax is quite elegant and capable of delivering a wide array of beautiful background effects. For a taste of what’s possible, see Lea Verou’s CSS3 Patterns Gallery at *[http://lea.verou.me/css3patterns/](http://lea.verou.me/css3patterns/)* for some effects that really push the envelope—although keep in mind my warning at the beginning of the chapter about performance, as some of these examples can be quite taxing on your mobile browser.

Also, as I write this, plans are afoot to extend the possibilities with a new gradient type, `conic`, which offers the possibility of even more exciting effects.

Now that we’ve finished this short run of chapters that look at ways to decorate page elements, we’ll move on in the next chapters to cover a whole new field of expertise: transforming and animating page elements.

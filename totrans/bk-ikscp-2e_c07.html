			</header>
			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="115"/>As a sequel to the previous chapter on transformation,
let's look at how Inkscape allows you not only to transform objects freely but to do it quickly, precisely, and,
to some extent, automatically. The two main approaches are snapping and arranging.</p>
			<p><em>Snapping</em> refers to making some points, lines, or paths work as magnets, so
that when you are moving something in the vicinity of such a magnetic attractor,
the thing you're moving "snaps" into the exact desired position. <em>Arranging</em>
moves a large number of objects in a regular way so that they
are aligned, distributed, scattered, or lined up into a grid exactly as you want them
to be.</p>
			<a id="section7.1"/><h2>7.1 Guides</h2>
			<p>
				The easiest way to snap objects into alignment is by creating a guide (guideline).<em>Guides</em> are visible, infinitely long 
straight lines on the canvas that you can use for alignment and snapping. Guides are not objects:
they cannot be selected, they don't print, and they don't show up on bitmap exports.  Although
they are saved with the document, they are not part of the SVG standard and are 
invisible in <a id="116"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_116" title="116"/>SVG viewers other than Inkscape. They are just Inkscape-specific helpers
for organizing your artwork.</p>
			<p>For example, guides may separate parts of your layout, helping you visualize the edges
of various areas or cells. A guide can be a centerline so you can draw
symmetrically around it. Or you can use a guide to verify whether objects are
really aligned or just look like they are.</p>
			<p>
				To create a guide manually, the canvas rulers must be visible; if they're hidden,
display them with Ctrl-R. Click anywhere on a ruler and, without releasing
the mouse, drag your cursor out to the canvas. A new guide appears that you can now drop
(by releasing the mouse) where you want it. Naturally, dragging off the horizontal ruler
creates <em>horizontal guides</em>, and dragging off the vertical ruler creates<em>vertical guides</em>; what's more interesting, dragging from the very ends of the
rulers creates <em>diagonal guides</em>, slanted (by default) at 45 degrees, as shown in <a href="#fig7-1">Figure 7-1</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig7-1"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="08/guides-create.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 7-1: Creating guides by dragging from
rulers</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Moving a guideline is easy. With the Selector or Node tool, hover over a guide;  notice that it becomes red, which means it's now grabbable. Click and drag the guide to where you want it to be.  To delete a guide, simply drag it back onto a ruler and drop it there, or hover and press Delete while it is red.</p>
			<p>
				To toggle visibility of all guidelines in the document, press the | key (this is the 
vertical pipe character, usually on the same key as the \ but requiring
Shift). 
This key hides the guides without deleting anything; if you press |
again (or try to create a new guideline), all hidden guidelines will be displayed
again. This key controls both guide visibility and snapping to guides (so there's no snapping to
invisible guides); if you want to disable snapping without hiding the guides, use
the % key (the global snapping toggle, <a href="#section7.3">7.3</a>).</p>
			<a id="section7.1.1"/><h3>7.1.1 Guide Anchor</h3>
			<p>
				Each guideline has a special point called an <em>anchor</em>, which looks like a small circle.
A guide's label, if any, is displayed next to its anchor. This is also the
axis around which you can <em>rotate</em> a guide manually by Shift-dragging it.</p>
			<p><a id="117"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_117" title="117"/>Usually the anchor is the point where you last released the mouse when you created or moved the guide.
It is also the point whose X/Y coordinates you view and edit in the <span class="ui">Guideline</span> dialog
(see the next section). To slide the anchor along its guide without moving the guide, Ctrl-drag it.</p>
			<p>When you're snapping to the guide, its anchor has magnetic power of its own. That is, when you're
near the anchor, you will snap not just to the guide but precisely to its anchor.</p>
			<a id="section7.1.2"/><h3>7.1.2 The Guideline Dialog</h3>
			<p>
				As often is the case in Inkscape, in addition to dragging guidelines around manually,
you can also use numbers to specify the precise position and angle of a guideline.
This is done in the <span class="ui">Guideline</span> dialog (<a href="#fig7-2">Figure 7-2</a>),
accessed by double-clicking any guideline.</p>
			<a id="fig7-2"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="08/guideline-dialog.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 7-2: The <span class="ui">Guideline</span> dialog</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The <span class="ui">Label</span> is any text string identifying this guide. It will be displayed along the guide next to the anchor.</li>
				<li>
					Below the <span class="ui">Label</span>, a color swatch shows and lets you change (click it for a color picker) the color (but, for some reason, not the opacity) of the guideline.</li>
				<li>
					For horizontal guides, the <span class="ui">Angle</span> is 0, while <span class="ui">Y</span> determines the
height of the guideline.</li>
				<li>
					For vertical guides, the <span class="ui">Angle</span> is 90, while <span class="ui">X</span> determines the
horizontal position of the guideline.</li>
				<li>
					For diagonal guides, the <span class="ui">Angle</span> sets the slant (default is 45 degrees),
while  the <span class="ui">X</span> and <span class="ui">Y</span> values together determine the anchor point through
which the guideline goes.</li>
				<li>
					The <span class="ui">Relative change</span> checkbox zeroes out all editable fields in the dialog; now, any
value you type into them will <em>add</em> to the current values, not replace them.</li>
				<li><a id="118"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_118" title="118"/>If you <span class="ui">Lock</span> the guide, it won't respond to hovering and you won't accidentally
drag it away (and it won't prevent you from selecting objects in its vicinity). It will still be possible
to double-click the guide to unlock it via this dialog, although you may need to do it over an
empty canvas so you don't double-click some object instead.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">OK</span> accepts your changes; the <span class="ui">Duplicate</span> and <span class="ui">Delete</span> buttons
do what they say (a duplicated guide is initially placed on top of the original one);<span class="ui">Cancel</span> closes the dialog without change.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Note that the <span class="ui">Guideline</span> dialog is <em>modal</em>, which means it locks the rest of Inkscape while
it is displayed.</p>
			<a id="section7.1.3"/><h3>7.1.3 Document Properties for Guides</h3>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Guides</span> tab of
the <span class="ui">Document Properties</span> dialog (Shift-Ctrl-D) 
contains a few general options that affect all guidelines, as shown in <a href="#fig7-3">Figure 7-3</a>. These options are here rather than in the global <span class="ui">Preferences</span>
dialog because they are considered local to the document and are saved with it, so that different documents can have
different guide setups.</p>
			<a id="fig7-3"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="08/guideline-prefs.svg.png"/>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The <span class="ui">Show guides</span> checkbox does the same as the | key: it toggles visibility (and snappability) of all the guides in the document, without deleting them.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Lock all guides</span> makes all guides unresponsive to hovering or dragging, which may make your work (after you've set up all the guides you need) much easier. Caveats: newly created guides will still not be locked (though you can relock them if you go back to this dialog and turn <span class="ui">Lock all guides</span> off and then on again); guides that you made locked individually (<a href="#section7.1.2">7.1.2</a>) will be unlocked too whenever you turn off this checkbox.</li>
				<li>
					The <span class="ui">Create guides around the page</span> button generates four guides along the four sides of your canvas so you can easily snap or align to the page frame.</li>
				<li>
					The <span class="ui">Delete all guides</span> button will be a godsend when you've ended up with way too many guides in your document and want to start over (but don't want to lose the content).</li>
				<li><a id="119"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_119" title="119"/>You can change the color and opacity of the guides in their normal state (default
is half-transparent blue) and under mouse hover (default is half-transparent
red). Clicking the color swatches opens a small color chooser dialog (<a href="#fig7-4">Figure 7-4</a>).
The <span class="ui">A</span> slider sets the <em>alpha</em> (transparency).  The color you set here 
affects only those guides for which you didn't set their own color (<a href="#section7.1.2">7.1.2</a>) as well as new
guides you create after the color change.<a id="fig7-4"/><figure>

			<h3>7.1.4 Guides from Objects</h3>
			<p>
				You've already seen measurements (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.9.6">6.9.6</a>) and the page frame converted to
guides, but you can convert any object to guides as well. Just select one or more objects and choose <span class="ui"><strong>Object<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Objects to Guides</strong></span> from the
menu, or press Shift-G.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						By default, this destroys the selected objects and
replaces them with a bunch of guidelines. To prevent this, toggle the <span class="ui"><strong>Keep
objects after conversion to guides</strong></span> checkbox in the <span class="ui"><strong>Tools</strong></span> page of <span class="ui"><strong>Preferences</strong></span>,
or simply press Ctrl-D before the conversion.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">

			<p><a href="#fig7-5">Figure 7-5</a> shows how this command works for different types of objects:</p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<ul>
				<li>
					For paths or rectangles, it replaces each straight path segment or rectangle side
with a coincident guide. Thus, converting a rectangle to
guides will create a rectangular area delineated by two pairs of parallel
guides. To quickly create a slanted guideline through two given points, switch
to the Pen tool (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.1.1">14.1.1</a>), click one point, double-click the other (to finalize the
straight line path), and convert this path to a guide.</li>
				<li>
					For 3D boxes (<a href="c11.xhtml#section11.3">11.3</a>), all 12 edges of a box are converted to guidelines.</li>
				<li>For everything else, the four sides of the object's bounding box are converted to
two vertical and two horizontal guides.</li>
			</ul><a id="section7.2"/>
			<h2>
				7.2 <a id="120"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_120" title="120"/>Grids</h2>
			<p>
				Think of a <em>grid</em> as a development of the idea of guides: it is a regular
pattern of guides that covers the entire canvas. Grids are often used for snapping, alignment,
equispaced distribution of objects, drawing to the pixel grid, or 
axonometric drawing (<a href="c24.xhtml">Chapter 24</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Inkscape supports two types of grids: <em>rectangular</em> and <em>axonometric</em> (<a href="#fig7-6">Figure 7-6</a>). One
document can display more than one grid, which can be different in type and/or spacing. To create a
new grid in your document, go to the <span class="ui"><strong>Grids</strong></span> tab of the <span class="ui"><strong>Document Properties</strong></span> dialog,
select the desired grid type, and click <span class="ui"><strong>New</strong></span>. A new grid
will light up in the document.</p>
			<a id="fig7-6"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="08/grid-types.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 7-6: Rectangular and axonometric grids</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>As you can see, a rectangular grid consists of two perpendicular sets of guides,
whereas the axonometric grid has three sets, one vertical and two others at an angle (by
default at 30 and –30 degrees). The rectangular grid is the most common type; the
axonometric grid is typically used for drawing pseudo-3D scenes without vanishing points.</p>
			<p><a id="121"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_121" title="121"/>You will notice that Inkscape 
keeps the visual density of the grid lines within certain limits independent of zoom. As you zoom out,
the lines get closer to each other—but then Inkscape weeds the grid by showing only every tenth grid line.
Such decimation of grid lines happens again and again as you zoom out so as to keep the grid display reasonable.
Inversely, as you zoom in, Inkscape reveals more and more grid lines so as to fill your screen evenly.</p>
			<p>
				New lines stop appearing only at a zoom level where <em>all</em> the lines are visible; the default rectangular grid spacing is 1 px.
Just as a ruler where centimeter  marks are larger than millimeter marks, Inkscape makes every fifth line (called a <em>major line</em>) a
little darker than the others (<em>minor lines</em>); you can see this in
close zooms.</p>
			<p>
				To hide all grids in your document, press the # key; another # will display all hidden grids again.
This key controls both grid visibility and snapping to grid, so you would never  snap
to an invisible grid; if you want to disable only snapping without hiding,
use the % key (global snapping toggle, <a href="#section7.3">7.3</a>).</p>
			<a id="section7.2.1"/><h3>7.2.1 Grid Options</h3>
			<p>
				You  can change some aspects of your document's grids in the <span class="ui">Document Properties</span>
dialog. Once you create a grid, you will see a new grid properties panel at the bottom of
the dialog, as shown in <a href="#fig7-7">Figure 7-7</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig7-7"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="08/grid-prefs.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 7-7: Grid properties for a rectangular grid (left) and for an axonometric grid (right)</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>You can create more than one grid in the same document, and by default, they
will all be visible at once—although you can enable or disable any of them separately.
In the dialog, each grid will have its own tab.</p>
			<p>Here are the settings you can change for a grid:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="ui">Enable</span> or disable the grid (which basically means turning 
snapping to it on or off), and toggle whether it is <span class="ui">Visible</span>.  Disabling a grid hides it, but
hiding it does not disable it—so here, if you prefer, you can set up snapping to an invisible grid. 
Separately, you can allow snapping <span class="ui">to visible grid lines only</span>, ignoring those lines that are hidden
due to the zoom level. For rectangular grids only, you can switch to showing grid intersections as<span class="ui">dots instead of lines</span>.</li>
				<li><a id="122"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_122" title="122"/>The grid origin settings let you shift the grid as a whole. You can set the <span class="ui">Origin X</span> and <span class="ui">Origin Y</span> numerically,
or you can use one of the nine <span class="ui">Align to page</span> buttons on the left to move the origin to one of the page's corners,
mid-sides, or center.</li>
				<li>
					The <span class="ui">Spacing</span> settings define the density of the lines (remember, if you make the grid too dense, Inkscape won't show
all the lines anyway until you zoom in close enough). For a rectangular grid, there are two
spacing values, <span class="ui">X</span> (horizontal) and <span class="ui">Y</span> (vertical). For an axonometric grid, there's only
one spacing value—the distance between the intersections along the <span class="ui">Y</span> axis; the
intervals between the vertical lines are fully determined by this distance and the axonometric angles.
All these values are, as usual, coupled with a unit selector (a drop-down list).</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Angles</span> are available only for axonometric grids. These are the
angles of the two sets of diagonal lines. By default, both are 30 degrees
(measured counterclockwise from horizontal for <span class="ui">Angle X</span> and clockwise for <span class="ui">Angle Z</span>), but they can
be anything from 0 (no vertical guides at all) to 90 degrees (careful, your canvas will be
entirely covered with vertical guides!), and they don't have to be equal to each other.
					<p>
						If you have added an axonometric grid to your document, new diagonal guides
(<a href="#section7.1">7.1</a>) will be created with the same angles as those used by the grid.</p>
			</li>
				<li>
					You can set <span class="ui">colors</span> separately for the <span class="ui">Major</span> and <span class="ui">Minor</span> grid lines. By
default they are both blue, but the minor lines are less opaque (so less
visible).</li>
				<li>
					You can adjust the frequency of the major lines; by default, <span class="ui">every</span> 5th
grid line is major.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				You cannot "convert a grid to objects," but if you need a grid of real objects (which, unlike Inkscape's helper grids, other SVG software will also display),
try the clone tiler (<a href="c16.xhtml#section16.6">16.6</a>) or <span class="ui"><strong>Extensions<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Render<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Grids</strong></span> (<a href="c19.xhtml#section19.2">19.2</a>).</p>
			<a id="section7.3"/><h2>7.3 Snapping</h2>
			<p>Now that you know everything about guides and grids, let's look at what guides
and grids are most often created for: snapping.</p>
			<p>
				The idea of snapping is simple: Inkscape tries to place things where you<em>want</em> them instead of where you actually move them with your 
always shaky mouse or tablet pen movements. As soon as you move a <em>snappable</em>
(something that can be snapped) close enough to an active <em>snap target</em>, it jumps
right into place. Snapping is fundamentally interactive; it 
happens only when you drag something with your mouse (but not, for example, when you move
objects with the arrow keys on your keyboard or use the <span class="ui">Align and Distribute</span> dialog).</p>
			<p>Snappables can be entire objects as well as various nodes or points (path
nodes, gradient handles, fixed point, and so on) inside objects.  Snap destinations, apart
from guides and grids, can be other objects and
their parts (that is, objects can snap to objects, if you allow them).
Snapping is a big topic—but it's not deep: once you get the basic idea, the rest is
just remembering the numerous modes and toggles.</p>
			<p><a id="123"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_123" title="123"/>Snapping is extremely useful when you need it—but, admittedly, extremely annoying when you don't.
If snapping gets in your way, just remember that there's a <em>master snap
toggle</em>—the % key—that enables or
disables all kinds of snapping in the entire program. (Here's a mnemonic:
view the <code>%</code> character as two nodes about to snap to a
slanted guideline.) Unlike the | (guides toggle) and # (grid
toggle), this key turns snapping behavior on or off but does not hide or show
anything.  Also, in the Selector and most other tools, dragging objects or nodes with Shift
temporarily disables snapping as you drag.</p>
			<a id="section7.3.1"/><h3>7.3.1 The Snap Controls Bar</h3>
			<p>
				Most of the snapping controls are collected in the <em>snap controls bar</em>, by
default displayed vertically at the rightmost edge of the Inkscape window (<a href="#fig7-8">Figure 7-8</a>). Use<span class="ui"><strong>View<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Show/Hide<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Snap Controls Bar</strong></span> to turn it on or
off.</p>
			<a id="fig7-8"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="08/snap-bar.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 7-8: The snap controls bar</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The topmost button on the bar is the master snap toggle; when it's off, all other buttons
on the bar are disabled.</p>
			<p><a id="124"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_124" title="124"/>Things that snap and are snapped to are classified into three families that correspond to the three main sections of the snap
controls bar (a fourth section at the bottom controls general snapping aids such as grids and guides).
Each section of the bar has its own master toggle button at the top of it; somewhat confusingly (even if somewhat consistently),
these sub-master toggles look exactly the same as the master snapping toggle at the very top. (Inkscape could
really benefit from contributions by talented icon designers!) The three families are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Bounding boxes and their elements in the Selector tool (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.3">4.3</a>).</li>
				<li>
					Paths, path nodes, and path node handles (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5.1">12.5.1</a>).</li>
				<li>
					Everything else: gradient handles (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.1">10.1</a>), guide anchors (<a href="#section7.1.1">7.1.1</a>), transform fixed points (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.4">6.4</a>), text anchors and baselines (<a href="c15.xhtml#ch15">Chapter 15</a>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Sometimes, members of one group can snap to members of another one,
but in general, they tend to snap within their own family. In particular,
nodes and handles never snap to bounding boxes (although they can snap to paths).</p>
			<p>
				The last section of the bar, at the bottom, controls major snap destinations that work
for all three groups: the edges of the page (<a href="c02.xhtml#section2.3">2.3</a>), grid (<a href="#section7.2">7.2</a>), and guides (<a href="#section7.1">7.1</a>).
These buttons affect only snapping; unlike the | and # keys,
they will not hide the grid or guides.</p>
			<p>
				In the icons on the snapping bar buttons, <em>blue</em> is used for the<em>snappables</em> (what snaps, which can only be points) while <em>green</em> depicts<em>snap targets</em> (what you snap <em>to</em>, which can be lines or points). If the same kind of entity
can be both a snap target and a snappable, its button's icon uses green.
(An exception to this is the grid and guide icons, which are snap targets but are traditionally blue.)</p>
			<p>Let's look at the three families of snappables and snap targets.</p>
			<a id="section7.3.1.1"/>
			<h4>7.3.1.1 Bounding Boxes Snapping</h4>
			<p>
				If you just need to align whole objects and aren't interested in nodes or
other special points, use bounding box snapping, as shown in <a href="#fig7-9">Figure 7-9</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig7-9"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="08/snap-bbox.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 7-9: Bounding box snapping options</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The first button in this group (<a href="#fig7-8">Figure 7-8</a>) is the local master switch. Disabling it disables the
whole group, so you no longer need to worry about snapping of or to bounding boxes.</p>
			<p>Further down, the buttons control, in order:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Snap target: <em>edges</em> of the bounding boxes. When on, edges of the bounding boxes of all objects (selected or not) work as guides.</li>
				<li><a id="125"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_125" title="125"/>Snap target and snappable: <em>corners</em> of the bounding boxes. When on, dragging anything in the
Selector lets the corners of the selection bounding box snap.<a href="#fig7-10">Figure 7-10</a> shows what happens when these two buttons are on and you drag one ellipse near another.<a id="fig7-10"/><figure>
						<img alt="" src="08/snap-corner-side.png"/>
						<figcaption>
							<p>Figure 7-10: Snapping a bounding box corner to bounding box side</p>
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>When snapping happens, Inkscape flashes a cross mark and a helpful tip at the snap point. If the bounding box you've snapped to
is that of an unselected object, it will also be temporarily visualized as a red dashed box.</p>
			</li>
				<li>
					Snap target and snappable: <em>midpoints</em> of the bounding box sides (four per box). You can think of it as snapping the
central axes of objects; it makes most sense for objects that are symmetric around that axis.</li>
				<li>
					Snap target and snappable: <em>centers</em> of the bounding boxes. With this enabled, you can, for example, easily snap
central-symmetric objects into symmetric compositions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When you have both a line and a point on that line as snap targets (such as a bounding box side and its midpoint), the point target
overtakes when you are close enough to it. Otherwise, you will snap to the nearest point on the line (and easily slide along it).</p>
			<a id="section7.3.1.2"/><h4>7.3.1.2 Paths and Nodes Snapping</h4>
			<p>
				The second group of buttons (<a href="#fig7-8">Figure 7-8</a>)
controls snapping of path nodes (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.1">12.1</a>) as you edit them in the Node tool, as shown in <a href="#fig7-11">Figure 7-11</a>.
It also controls gradient/pattern handles (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.1">10.1</a>, <a href="c10.xhtml#section10.8">10.8</a>) that you can edit
in the Gradient tool and other tools.</p>
			<a id="fig7-11"/><figure>

			<h3>7.3.2 Snapping Preferences</h3>
			<p>
				On the <span class="ui">Snap</span> tab of the <span class="ui">Document Properties</span> dialog (<a href="#fig7-13">Figure 7-13</a>), you can adjust
the snapping distances—how close you must get to the snap target for a snap to
happen. You can set these distances (stored per document) separately for snapping to objects
(including bounding boxes, paths, and nodes), grids, and guides.</p>
			<p>
				For grids, the default setting is <span class="ui">Always snap</span>—that is, snapping
happens at any distance (which, for a grid, cannot be more than the grid spacing anyway). If
you zoomed out and some of the grid lines are hidden (<a href="#section7.2">7.2</a>), snapping will happen only to
visible grid lines.</p>
			<p><a id="127"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_127" title="127"/>For objects and guides, snapping is triggered, by default, at a distance of 20 screen
pixels or closer. Using the screen pixel unit ensures that the snapping force is
independent of zoom; if you want to move a snappable close to a snap destination
but avoid snapping, you can do it at a closer zoom level.</p>
			<p>
				You can also control whether snapping to paths will include clipping paths and masks (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.3">18.3</a>), as shown in <a href="#fig7-13">Figure 7-13</a>.</p>

				<li><span class="ui">Snap indicator</span> (on by default) is the cross mark and text label that flash on the canvas to tell you what just snapped to what (<a href="#fig7-10">Figure 7-10</a>). They pop up whenever snapping happens and disappear after the <span class="ui">Snap indicator persistence</span> delay that you can adjust (by default, it's 2 seconds).</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Only snap the node closest to the pointer</span> tells Inkscape to
ignore all other nodes you may be dragging except the one to which your mouse cursor is
the closest. For example, if you plan to snap a corner of a rectangle, simply grab the
rectangle near this corner for dragging—then the three other corners will not get in your
way. This reduces "snapping noise" that may get very distracting in complex
documents. If this option is on (by default, it's off), Inkscape will display a round
mark over the closest snappable node while you drag.</li>
				<li><a id="128"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_128" title="128"/><span class="ui">Weight factor</span> is another parameter that controls Inkscape's
choice of which of the dragged points to snap if more than one gets within snapping
distance of a target. If set to 0, Inkscape snaps whichever point is the closest to
its target, ignoring the position of the mouse cursor. Setting it to 1 is the same as
the <span class="ui">Only snap the node closest to the pointer</span> option described above: now,
among all nodes that <em>want</em> to snap, snapping will happen for the node that is
closest to the cursor (which may or may not be the same as the node closest to its
snap target). A value between 0 and 1 allows you to balance these two
snapping strategies.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Delay</span> is the time, in seconds, that Inkscape waits
after your mouse pointer stops before doing the snap. Increasing this value makes
snapping more "reluctant"—which may be a good thing if your document is
complex and you have many snapping modes enabled, so everything wants to snap to
everything. In this case, increasing the delay and decreasing the snap distance will
make your work easier.</li>
			</ul><a id="section7.4"/>
			<h2>7.4 Aligning</h2>
			<p>
				Aligning, like snapping, is a way to put objects in precise positions.
Unlike snapping, it is not interactive: you just select your objects, choose a command, 
and the objects move into their positions all at once. Alignment commands are collected in the
powerful <span class="ui">Align and Distribute</span> dialog (Shift-Ctrl-A or <span class="ui">Object<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Align and Distribute</span> from the menu).</p>
			<p>
				Let's look at the align part of the dialog first (<a href="#fig7-15">Figure 7-15</a>).</p>
				<a id="fig7-15"/>
				<figure>
				<img alt="" src="08/align.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 7-15: Aligning objects</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="129"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_129" title="129"/>To make sense of the <span class="ui">Align</span> dialog's many buttons, observe the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Buttons in the top row align things by moving horizontally; those in the bottom
row, by moving vertically.</li>
				<li>
					All alignment buttons move objects relative to the <em>anchor box</em>; use the <span class="ui">Relative to</span>
list to determine what that anchor box is. The
default that works in most cases is <span class="ui">Selection Area</span>—that is, the combined
bounding box of all selected objects.  You can also select the bounding box
of one of the selected objects (the one that was the first or last to be selected,
or the biggest or smallest one) as well as the entire page or entire drawing's bounding
box.
					<p>
						For example, if you have a collection of small objects and want to align them
against the top of a large background object, select everything and choose<span class="ui"><strong>Biggest object</strong></span> in the <span class="ui"><strong>Relative to</strong></span> list.</p>
			</li>
				<li>
					In the middle of this group, two buttons in the two rows align centers
of selected objects at the center of the anchor box horizontally (top row) and vertically (bottom row).
Around these two are the four buttons that press objects against the edges of the anchor box <em>on the inside</em>.
Together, these six buttons are perhaps the most commonly used in the entire dialog. The four remaining
buttons, two on the left and two on the right, align the objects at the edges of the anchor box but <em>on the
outside</em>.</li>
				<li>
					The two buttons on the right end—those with letters on them—apply only to<em>text objects</em>. Every text object has a <em>baseline origin point</em> (<a href="c15.xhtml#section15.4.4">15.4.4</a>), and these
buttons align the selected text object by these points.
If, instead, you align text objects as regular objects by their bounding boxes, the
characters with and without <em>descenders</em> (such as the bottom stroke of a <em>y</em>)
and <em>ascenders</em> (such as the stem of a <em>d</em>) will not keep the line, as shown in<a href="#fig7-16">Figure 7-16</a>.<a id="fig7-16"/><figure>

			<h3>
				7.4.1 <a id="130"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_130" title="130"/>Aligning by Handles</h3>
			<p>
				By default, a second click on the selection in the Selector tool (or, alternatively, pressing Shift-S)
switches the onscreen handles from the scale mode to rotate mode and back (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.3">6.3</a>). If alignment is something
you do often, you will appreciate that you can enable a <em>third</em> mode, the <em>align mode</em>, which is included in the
click or Shift-S cycle if you toggle the <span class="ui">Enable on-canvas alignment handles</span> button in the <span class="ui">Align and Distribute</span>
dialog (to the left of the <span class="ui">Relative to</span> drop-down).</p>
			<p>
				Make sure the <span class="ui">Enable on-canvas alignment handles</span> button is on, select some objects, and then click the selection two times (don't double-click) or press Shift-S twice.
The first click/key switches to the rotate mode, and the second one switches to the align mode with distinct handles. Now, to align all selected objects
relative to the bounding box of the selection, just click or Shift-click one of the nine handles. <a href="#fig7-17">Figure 7-17</a> shows how that works.</p>

			<h2>
				7.5 <a id="131"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_131" title="131"/>Distributing</h2>
			<p><em>Distributing</em> selected objects moves them so that the intervals between them,
if measured in a certain way, become equal. The same <span class="ui">Align and Distribute</span>
dialog has eight object distribution buttons and two text distribution buttons,
differing in how they measure these intervals. As with alignment buttons, half of these
buttons (the top row) move horizontally and the other half (the bottom row) move
vertically (see <a href="#fig7-18">Figure 7-18</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig7-18"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="08/distribute.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 7-18: Distributing objects</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Right under the centering buttons in the <span class="ui">Align</span> section, the<span class="ui">Distribute</span> section has two buttons for <em>distributing centers</em>.
These buttons move selected objects in such a way that their
centers (more precisely, the centers of their bounding boxes) are at equal distances
from each other horizontally or vertically.</p>
			<p>To the right and left of these two buttons, four more buttons perform the
same equispaced distribution but for the right and left, bottom and top sides of the
bounding boxes.</p>
			<p>
				Two more buttons further to the right, instead of equalizing distances between
same-named edges of bounding boxes, make the <em>gaps</em> between them equal.
For example, in horizontal gap equalization, the distances between the right edge of one
object to the left edge of the next one will become the same. When objects have different 
widths, this may make more visual sense than evenly distributing their centers.<a href="#fig7-19">Figure 7-19</a> shows the difference between
distributing centers and equalizing gaps.</p>
			<a id="fig7-19"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="08/distribute-equigaps.svg.png"/>

			</figure>
			<p><a id="132"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_132" title="132"/>Finally, the two buttons furthest to the right distribute the baseline origin points of the selected
text objects.</p>
			<p>
				Unlike alignment buttons, distribution buttons always use the selection's bounding box
as its anchor box (that is, the <span class="ui">Relative to</span> choice does not affect the <span class="ui">Distribute</span>
section of the dialog). In other words, distributing always preserves the bounding box
of the selection because it never moves the leftmost and rightmost (for horizontal) or
topmost and bottommost (for vertical) objects, but only those that fall between
them. (One consequence of this is that distributing only makes sense for three or more
selected objects.)</p>
			<p>So, if after distributing you find that your objects are too dense or too sparse,
just select one of the objects at the edge of your distribution and move it inward (to make it denser)
or outward (to make it sparser). Then, reselect all objects again and distribute them once more.</p>
			<p>
				Note that selected objects may overlap, both before and after
distributing. Even when equalizing gaps, objects' edges may overlap; such overlaps
are treated as <em>negative gaps</em>, and they are still made equal to each other when you
click the button. In other words, when there's not enough room, adjacent
objects are made to overlap by the same amount.</p>
			<p>
				When you are using the Node tool (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5">12.5</a>), the <span class="ui">Align and Distribute</span> dialog shows
four buttons that allow
you to align or distribute, horizontally or vertically, the selected path nodes (<a href="#fig7-20">Figure 7-20</a>).</p>

			<h3>
				7.5.1 Exchanging Places <span class="NoteHead">[1.1]</span></h3>
			<p>
				All the basic alignment and distribution commands described so far have one thing
in common: they work only in one dimension—either horizontally or
vertically. The same <span class="ui">Align and Distribute</span> dialog, however, has a number of more interesting commands
that move objects in both dimensions at once.</p>
			<p>
				One common operation is <em>exchanging places</em>. For two objects, this moves the center of object A to
where the center of B was, and vice versa; for multiple objects, this moves A to the place of B, B to the place of C,
and so on until Z jumps to the former place of A.</p>
			<p>
				The dialog has three buttons for variations of this simple idea (<a href="#fig7-21">Figure 7-21</a>).
They work exactly the same with two selected objects but differ in how they determine the A, B,..., Z order when more
than two objects are selected.</p>

			</dl><a id="section7.5.2"/>
			<h3>7.5.2 Randomizing and Unclumping</h3>
			<p><em>Randomizing</em> simply moves each selected object to a random position within the
selection's bounding box. Each click of the button results in a new random
placement—you can repeat this until you find a randomization you like, as shown in <a href="#fig7-22">Figure 7-22</a>.</p>

but works in both dimensions at once, trying to equalize the closest distances
within all pairs of adjacent objects in
the selection. It works best for a large number of objects, as shown in <a href="#fig7-23">Figure 7-23</a>.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>
				Unclumping is an iterative operation, so you may want to use it repeatedly
until you are satisfied with the result. It does not replace
your current arrangement entirely but improves it in small steps, nudging each object
toward a point equidistant from its immediate neighbors (which themselves move).
The most noticeable result of this is a reduction of <em>clumps</em>—places
where objects are too dense.</p>
			<p>In most cases, iterative unclumping converges—that is, it reduces
visual unevenness in distribution of the objects, so that each subsequent unclumping
has progressively less of an effect. At some point, further attempts to unclump an already-unclumped swarm of objects
will just slowly disperse and migrate them in random directions without improving uniformity.</p>
			<p>
				Unclumping objects produces a texture that looks random and man-made at the same time.
It is similar to what a human would produce if asked to fill a space evenly with random dots.
Examples of such textures include polka-dot patterns (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.8.4">10.8.4</a>) and dot engravings
where shading is created by smoothly (without clumps) varying the density of scattered dots.</p>

						Unclumping does not take into account the actual shape of your
objects—only their bounding boxes. It therefore works best with objects of
a simple consistent shape, such as circles or stars. You will see more examples of
unclumping in the section on the clone tiler (<a href="c16.xhtml#section16.6">16.6</a>).</p>

			<h3>
				7.5.3 <a id="135"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_135" title="135"/>Removing Overlaps</h3>
			<p>
				Unlike unclumping, <em>removing overlaps</em> is a deterministic operation.
It moves each selected object by a strictly minimum distance required for all 
objects to be free from overlaps—and it usually succeeds on the first attempt (I say "usually" because,
in general, this is not a trivial operation and may sometimes fail). The amount
of moving it performs, of course, depends on the initial arrangement—but in
most cases, the layout of objects after this operation will still be similar to the
original layout, even though it may have done some drastic reshuffling to free up the objects.</p>
			<p>
				For this command, you can additionally set the horizontal and
vertical spacing (in <code>px</code> units) added to the objects' bounding boxes, as shown in <a href="#fig7-24">Figure 7-24</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig7-24"/><figure>

				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 7-24: Removing overlaps between objects</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Notice that the objects that did not overlap with any other selected object did not move.</p>
			<p>
				Yet another button in this dialog, <span class="ui">Connector network layout</span>, is supposed to nicely
rearrange a diagram made with the Connector tool (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.5">14.5</a>). In theory, this should move the connected
objects around so as to minimize the length and/or intersections of connector lines;
in practice, it looks like this command works no better than plain <span class="ui">Remove overlaps</span>.</p>
			<a id="section7.5.4"/><h3>7.5.4 Arranging Objects</h3>
			<p>
				Even with all the possibilities in the <span class="ui">Align and Distribute</span> dialog,
you may have some unfilled object arrangement needs. The <span class="ui">Arrange</span> dialog (accessed from the<span class="ui">Object</span> menu) fills two of them: it will arrange your objects into either a two-dimensional table or a circle,
both with plenty of spacing and alignment options (as you would expect from Inkscape).</p>
			<p>
				This dialog is most useful for <em>different</em> objects that you
already have, such as imported bitmaps that you want to arrange into a gallery.
If you just need a pattern, table, or grid of <em>identical</em> objects (or
objects that differ only in size or style), look into the clone tiler (<a href="c16.xhtml#section16.6">16.6</a>).</p>
			<a id="section7.5.4.1"/><h4>
				7.5.4.1 <a id="136"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_136" title="136"/>Arranging in a Grid</h4>
			<p>
				The dialog's <span class="ui">Rectangular grid</span> tab (<a href="#fig7-25">Figure 7-25</a>) takes the number of selected objects and calculates
the <span class="ui">Rows</span> and <span class="ui">Columns</span> that would make the most compact table (with the number of rows as close to the number of columns as possible).
If you change any of these numbers, the other one recalculates. For example, if there are 29 objects selected, 
the dialog will suggest 5 rows and 6 columns; if you scroll the number of rows up, the number of
rows and columns will drop—so you will get 6 by 5, 8 by 4, 10 by 3, and so on.</p>
			<a id="fig7-25"/><figure>

						Figure 7-25: Using the <span class="ui">Arrange</span> dialog to create

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Next, two checkboxes control whether all rows and all columns will
have equal height and width, respectively. With the <span class="ui">Equal height</span> on,
all rows in the entire grid will be as high as the tallest of <em>all objects</em> (plus
spacing, see below). If it's off, each row will be only as high as the tallest of all
objects <em>in this row</em> (plus spacing). Note that even with <span class="ui">Equal width</span> off and with zero spacing,
your objects will not necessarily touch in the grid if the widest-in-column objects happen to be not in adjacent cells.</p>
			<p>Further down, a group of buttons select which point of each object is being aligned into a grid.
This is how you control the alignment of objects within their rows and columns; by default, they are centered
in both dimensions.</p>
			<p>
				The rest of the controls define how large your grid will be.
The <span class="ui">Fit into selection box</span> option ensures that the arrangement will be exactly as wide
and as tall as was your selection before you clicked <span class="ui">Arrange</span>. In other
words, after creating the grid, Inkscape will set the spacing between rows and columns
so that the overall dimensions of the selection don't change (even if this results in overlaps).
For example, if you want to make a grid sparser, undo arranging, drag one of the objects away from others,
reselect all objects, enable <span class="ui"><strong>Fit into selection box</strong></span>, and <span class="ui"><strong>Arrange</strong></span> again. Alternatively, you can <span class="ui">Set spacing</span>
for rows and columns explicitly by typing the desired values and choosing the unit.</p>
			<p><a id="137"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_137" title="137"/>The biggest problem with the grid arrangement is that the row/column position of each object is somewhat unpredictable.
Even if your objects are already in a rough table and you just want to line them up, using this dialog may
make some objects reshuffle to obviously wrong places. If you're trying to fix this by swapping places of a couple objects,
try the object exchanging commands in the <span class="ui">Align and Distribute</span> dialog.</p>

				The other tab of the <span class="ui">Arrange</span> dialog, <span class="ui">Polar Coordinates</span>, lets you put a number of objects into a circular or elliptic ring,
with equal angular distances between them. For example, with six selected objects, you get a hexagon, as shown in <a href="#fig7-26">Figure 7-26</a>.</p>

				You can select which point of each object is aligned to the circle; by default, it's the center, but you can switch to any of the corners
or midpoints of the bounding box, as well as use each object's rotational center (that is, the fixed point, <a href="c06.xhtml#section6.4">6.4</a>). As for the circle to which
you're arranging, it can be an actual circle, ellipse, or arc (<a href="c11.xhtml#section11.4">11.4</a>) included in the selection, or you can switch to <span class="ui">Parametrized</span>
and specify the arrangement guide via coordinates. The final option selects whether the objects will be rotated when placed into their
positions (the default) or moved without rotation.</p>

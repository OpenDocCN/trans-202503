			<p class="BodyContinued">Special thanks to the team at No Starch Press for helping make this book a reality: Bill Pollock, Nathan Heidelberger, Barbara Yien, Dapinder Dosanjh, Liz Chadwick, Jennifer Kelley, Matthew Kim, Annie Choi, Janelle Ludowise, Laurel Chun, Athabasca Witschi, Rachel Monaghan, JoAnne Burek, Lisa Devoto Farrell, Derek Yee, Paula Fleming, and Paula Williamson.</p>
			<p>Thanks to my long-time colleague, fellow educator, and friend, Bryan Fagan, for his thoughtful and thorough technical review across all the changes in Kali Linux and most of the hacking tools over the past two years.</p>
			<p>Thanks to my mom, Esta, for buying me that Commodore 64 in the early 1980s and encouraging me to pursue my dreams—I never knew how far coding and hacking would take me. Thanks to my father-in-law, Norman, for always having time to talk computers with me. And thanks most of all to my beautiful wife, Bev, and my sons, Alex and Max, for their love and support as I wrote this third book—thanks especially for making me take breaks to jump on the trampoline, do science experiments, play games, watch movies, and swim. This book, and my life, are infinitely better and more fun thanks to you.</p>

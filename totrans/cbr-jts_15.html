<p class="ChapterIntro">The <em>Bansenshūkai </em>describes an open-disguise infiltration technique for shinobi called “the art of fireflies” (<em>hotarubi no jutsu</em>).<sup class="endnote"><a id="c15-noteref-96" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-96">1</a></sup> I like to think that this technique was named based on how the flash of light from a firefly lingers in your night vision after the fly has moved, causing you to grasp at empty space. <em>Shōninki</em> describes the same technique as “the art of camouflage” (<em>koto wo magirakasu no narai</em>).<sup class="endnote"><a id="c15-noteref-97" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-97">2</a></sup> Using this technique, shinobi plant physical evidence that baits an enemy into taking some desired action, including misattributing whom the shinobi works for, making false assumptions about the shinobi’s motives, and reacting rashly to the attempted attack, exposing themselves to further offensive actions.</p>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="114" id="Page_114"/>A forged letter with incriminating details or misleading evidence about the enemy was the most common <em>hotarubi no jutsu</em> technique, with several variations. The scrolls describe shinobi sewing a letter into their collar so that it would be found quickly if they were caught or searched.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c15-noteref-98" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-98">3</a></sup> Or, a shinobi might recruit a willing but inept person to be a “ninja,” give them a letter detailing the exact opposite of the shinobi’s true plans, and send them on a mission into the adversary’s environment, knowing that this “doomed agent” would certainly be captured. Importantly, the recruit themselves would not be aware of this part of the plan. Upon searching the recruit, guards would find the forged letter, which implicated a high-value target—such as the adversary’s most capable commander—in a treasonous plot. The “ninja” would likely break under torture and attest to the authenticity of the message, further damning the target.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c15-noteref-99" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-99">4</a></sup> This all served to deceive the enemy into attacking or disposing of their own allies.</p>&#13;
<p>In an even more elaborate variation, prior to the mission, the shinobi would carefully plant evidence that supported the letter’s false story and place the forged letter in an incriminating location, such as the quarters of the enemy commander’s trusted adviser. The forged letter then became a safeguard. If the shinobi were caught, they would withstand torture until they could determine the enemy’s objectives, and then reveal their secret knowledge of the letter. The enemy would then find the letter and the connected evidence. Having built credibility, the shinobi would then pledge to become a double agent or share secrets about their employer in exchange for not being executed.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c15-noteref-100" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-100">5</a></sup> This technique left the enemy confused about the shinobi’s motives, concerned about potential betrayal, and in doubt about who the real adversary was. </p>&#13;
<p>In this chapter, we will review the challenges associated with attributing threats to a specific adversary and/or source. We’ll cover attribution investigations using threat analytics, observable evidence, and behavior-based intelligence assessments. We’ll also discuss the problem of sophisticated adversaries who are aware of these attribution methods and thus take countermeasures. The more emphasis a defender places on attribution, the more difficult and risky cyber threat actors can make pursuing leads, so we’ll also discuss ways to address this increased risk. </p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-500549c15-0001">Attribution</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Attribution</em>, in a cybersecurity context, refers to an assessment of observable evidence that can be used to identify actors in cyberspace. The evidence can take many forms. A threat actor’s behavior, tools, techniques, <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="115" id="Page_115"/>tactics, procedures, capabilities, motives, opportunities, and intent, among other information, all provide valuable context and drive responses to security events.</p>&#13;
<p>For example, suppose your home alarm went off, indicating a window had been broken. Your response would vary drastically based on your level of attribution knowledge: a firefighter entering your home to extinguish a blaze would evoke a different response than a robber breaking in to steal your belongings, or an errant golf ball crashing through the window. Of course, attribution isn’t always simple to attain. A thief can exercise some control over observable evidence by wearing gloves and a mask. They could even wear a firefighter outfit to disguise their identity and deceive homeowners into acquiescing to their entry. A thief could plant, destroy, or avoid creating evidence of the crime during or after the act, impeding the subsequent work of forensic investigators. A truly sophisticated criminal might even frame another criminal using spoofed fingerprint pads; stolen hair, blood, or clothing samples; a realistic 3D-printed mask; or a weapon acquired from the unsuspecting patsy. If the framed individual has no alibi, or the crime is committed against a target consistent with their motivations, then authorities would have every reason to suspect or arrest the patsy.</p>&#13;
<p>Cybersecurity professionals face these types of attribution problems and then some. Attribution is particularly difficult due to the inherent anonymity of the cyber environment. Even after executing the difficult task of tracking an attack or event to a source computer and physical address, cybersecurity professionals can find it exceedingly hard to verify the identity of the human attacker. Attempts to trace the threat actor’s origin on the compromised machine often lead to tunnels, VPNs, encryption, and rented infrastructure with no meaningful logs or evidence. Sophisticated threat actors may even compromise and remotely connect to foreign machines, using them as platforms to launch attacks against other systems. Even after detecting the adversary, it may be advisable in certain cases to not immediately block them or remove their access; instead, it may be beneficial to monitor them for a while to determine their goals and identifying characteristics.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c15-noteref-101" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-101">6</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p>In some cases, threat groups deliberately leave behind tools or other observables to push an attribution narrative. The United States, Russia, and North Korea have reportedly altered or copied code segments, strings, infrastructure, and artifacts in their cybertools to cause misattribution.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c15-noteref-102" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-102">7</a></sup> When cybersecurity professionals discover and reverse engineer particularly stealthy malware, they occasionally observe unique, <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="116" id="Page_116"/>superfluous strings in the malware traces. Perhaps these strings were overlooked—a tradecraft error by the operator or developer. But they could also be “the art of fireflies”—evidence designed to be discovered and used for (mis)attribution.</p>&#13;
<p>Note that the same mechanisms that make deception possible also provide powerful means of identification. Memory dumps, disk images, registries, caches, network captures, logs, net flows, file analyses, strings, metadata, and more help identify cyber threat actors. Various intelligence disciplines, such as signal intelligence (SIGINT), cyber intelligence (CYBINT), and open source intelligence (OSINT), also contribute to attribution, while human intelligence (HUMINT) capabilities collect data from specific sources that, once processed and analyzed, helps indicate who may have conducted cyberattacks. These capabilities are typically kept secret, as disclosing their existence would inform targets how to avoid, deny, or deceive these systems, stunting the ability to generate useful intelligence and threat attribution. </p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-500549c15-0002">Approaches to Handling Attribution</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">It is reasonable for organizations to want to know the identity and origin of threat actors who compromise their systems and networks. It’s understandable that many want to take action, such as hacking back, to discover who these threat actors are. However, threat actors, like the shinobi, will always find ways to conduct covert malicious actions through denial and deception, making attribution uncertain. Furthermore, to take a lesson from history, the need to conduct shinobi attribution only ceased once Japan was unified under peaceful rule and shinobi were no more. The world is unlikely to experience unity in the foreseeable future, so nation-state cyberattacks are likely to continue. Until world peace happens, the following approaches to attribution can help you identify what, if anything, you can do about ongoing cyber conflict:</p>&#13;
<ol class="decimal">&#13;
<li value="1"><em>Shed your cognitive biases. </em>Reflect on your own cognitive biases and flawed logic. Everybody has holes in their thinking, but we can be mindful of them and work to correct them. Construct your own case studies. Review prior judgments that turned out to be incorrect, identify the mistakes made, and consider how to improve your analytical ability. This important work can be done in small steps (logic puzzles, crosswords, and brainteasers are a great way to improve cognitive function) or big strides. You can study articles and books on psychology that discuss known cognitive biases <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="117" id="Page_117"/>and logical fallacies and learn structured analytical techniques to overcome your own.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c15-noteref-103" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-103">8</a></sup> </li>&#13;
<li value="2"><em>Build attribution capabilities. </em>Examine what data sources, systems, knowledge, and controls you can use to influence attribution at your organization. Are you running open, unprotected Wi-Fi that allows unregistered, unauthenticated, and unidentified threat actors to anonymously connect to your network and launch attacks? Are you managing routers that allow spoofed IPs, or do they use reverse-path forwarding (RFP) protection technologies to prevent anonymized attacks from within your network? Are you correctly publishing a sender policy framework to prevent threat actors from spoofing email addresses and assuming your organization’s identity?<p class="ListBody">While many of these configuration changes incur no direct costs, the time and labor (and opportunity costs) to implement such wide-reaching changes can give management pause. However, consider whether a prior decision to invest in good cameras and lighting helps a storekeeper correctly identify a vandal. Establishing sound logging, documentation, and evidence collection practices improves attribution capabilities, enforces greater technological accountability, and provides end users with better visibility into network threats. </p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li value="3"><em>. . . Or forget about attribution. </em>Work with your organization’s stakeholders to determine the scope of attribution efforts necessary to mitigate risk. For organizations with the ability to arrest threat actors or launch counteroffensive attacks, attribution is a necessity. However, most organizations cannot or should not attempt to catch or attack threat actors, learn their identities, or map their capabilities. In reality, attribution to a specific threat actor is not always necessary. Awareness of the threat can be enough to analyze and defend against it.<p class="ListBody">For example, suppose two threat actors target your organization’s intellectual property. One wants to sell the information on the black market to make money, and the other wants the information to help build weapons systems for their country. It actually doesn’t matter. Regardless of the threat actors’ purpose and an organization’s capability to track them down, defenders must ultimately restrict or deny opportunities to exploit their security flaws. The organization does not necessarily need to assess a threat actor’s motivation to avoid the threat.</p>&#13;

<h2><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="118" id="Page_118"/>Castle Theory Thought Exercise</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Consider the scenario in which you are the ruler of a medieval castle with valuable assets inside. Your guards capture a stranger in the act of digging a tunnel under one of your castle walls. After intense interrogation, the stranger claims they were paid to dig a tunnel to the castle’s food storage so bandits could steal the supplies. However, your guards search the prisoner and discover a note with instructions on how to communicate with one of your trusted advisers. The note indicates that this adviser has a plan to spur rebellion against your rule by depriving your villagers of food. The message appears authentic. Your guards cannot identify the intruder or whom they are working for.</p>&#13;
<p>Consider how you would conduct attribution to determine who the intruder is, where they’re from, what their motivation might be, and whom they might be working for. How could you test the stranger’s assertion that their ultimate aim is to steal food—as opposed to, say, destroy the food, provide an infiltration route for a different threat actor, attack castle inhabitants, or even start a rebellion? How could you confirm your adviser’s role in enemy schemes? What actions would you take if you did find further evidence for the intruder’s attribution scenario? And what would you do if you couldn’t prove it?</p>&#13;

<h2 id="h1-500549c15-0003">Recommended Security Controls and Mitigations</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Where relevant, recommendations are presented with applicable security controls from the NIST 800-53 standard. Each should be evaluated with the concept of attribution in mind.</p>&#13;
<ol class="decimal">&#13;
<li value="1">Map accounts to user identities. Verify the identity of the individual associated with the user account via biometrics, identification, logical or physical evidence, or access controls. [SA-12: Supply Chain Protection | (14) Identity and Traceability]</li>&#13;
<li value="2">Develop a plan that defines how your organization handles attribution assessments of threat agents. [IR-8: Incident Response] </li>&#13;
<li value="3">Establish threat awareness programs that collect and share information on the characteristics of threat actors, how to identify them in your environment, evidence of attribution, and other observables. Use specific collection capabilities such as honeypots <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="119" id="Page_119"/>for attribution purposes. [PM-16: Threat Awareness Program; SC-26: HoneyPots]</li>&#13;
<li value="4">Apply security and collection controls. Perform threat modeling to identify threat agents. [SA-8: Security and Privacy Engineering Principles] </li>&#13;

<h2 id="h1-500549c15-0004">Debrief</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, we reviewed the art of the fireflies—a misattribution technique used by the shinobi. Cyber threat groups are continually evolving in sophistication, and they are likely to incorporate this technique into their operations security procedures, if they haven’t already. We noted that several threat groups are believed to be using misattribution techniques already and discussed approaches to handling attribution, and how the future for attribution is bleak.</p>&#13;
<p>In the next chapter, we will discuss shinobi tactics for maintaining plausible deniability when defenders interrogated them. The chapter will also discuss advanced shinobi interrogation techniques and tools used when capturing enemy shinobi. </p>&#13;

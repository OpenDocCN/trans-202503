    through the theory behind common API weaknesses and hacking best practices, the
    reader is encouraged to take a truly adversarial mindset. This highly effective,
    hands-on journey starts with tool introduction and reconnaissance, then covers
    everything from API fuzzing to complex access-control exploitation. With detailed
    labs, tips and tricks, and real-life examples, *Hacking APIs* is a complete workshop
    rolled into one book.”

    of APIs in such a manner that you’re wanting to not only know more, but also anticipating
    trying out your newfound knowledge on the next legitimate target. From concepts
    to examples, through to identifying tools and demonstrating them in fine detail,
    this book has it all. It is the mother lode for API hacking, and should be found
    next to the desk of ANYONE wanting to take this level of adversarial research,
    assessment, or DevSecOps seriously.”

    testing. In particular, this book gives you the tools to start testing the security
    of APIs, which have become a weak point for many modern web applications. Experienced
    security folks can get something out of the book, too, as it features lots of
    helpful automation tips and protection-bypass techniques that will surely up any
    pentester’s game.”

    cybersecurity, it is still hard to find solid insight into successfully performing
    penetration tests on APIs. *Hacking APIs* fully satisfies this demand—not only
    for the beginner cybersecurity practitioner, but also for the seasoned expert.”

    disaster films: everybody is stuck at home, the internet is out, and you can’t
    even turn on the stereo, cook anything fancy, or run any power tools. At the same
    time, the lingering uncertainty and the transitional nature of the event make
    it difficult to focus on profound creative endeavors. In other words, that novel
    you have in the works probably isn’t getting finished any time soon.'

    of a survival strategy, even if it sounds frivolous compared to the consequential
    matters discussed before. For groups of people, classic board games such as Risk,
    Monopoly, or Scrabble tend to work well—and are sometimes available in travel-sized
    varieties. A deck of cards, along with a pocket rule book, can be a source of
    old-fashioned fun too. For small children, a new plush toy or two is worth including
    in any evacuation kit; for adolescents and adults alike, an interesting book or
    a mechanical puzzle game can do the trick.

    and portable media players are all great options, provided that they work reliably
    without a network connection and that you have a way to recharge them every now
    and then. The precise choices are a matter of personal preference, but in the
    end, a small library of games, books, or fun electronics has a place in every
    preparedness plan.

    favors”: inexpensive but useful goods that can be handed out to neighbors or relatives
    in need. These may include cheap dollar-store flashlights, AM/FM radios, or wristwatches—or
    indeed, a travel-sized board game or a deck of cards. Other low-cost examples
    are travel-size oral hygiene kits, antiperspirant, energy bars, or water treatment
    pills.'

    leaves the entire neighborhood better off, earns you goodwill, and can make others
    reflect on the merits of prepping after the crisis ends. Just as important, it
    can set clear boundaries with those who know you prep. When you’re proactive and
    offer every person the same modest but valuable deal, you’re less likely to be
    suspected of playing favorites or hoarding more.

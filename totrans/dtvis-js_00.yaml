    to the largest social organizations in human history (giants like Facebook and
    Google), and its collection has widespread geopolitical implications, as we all
    saw with the NSA surveillance scandal. But it’s also getting easier to ignore
    the data itself. One estimate suggests that 99.5% of the data our systems collect
    goes to waste.

- en: '*Data visualization* is a tool that addresses this gap. Effective visualizations
    clarify; they transform abstract collections of numbers into shapes and forms
    that viewers quickly grasp and understand. The best visualizations impart this
    understanding intuitively. Viewers comprehend the data immediately—without thinking.
    This frees viewers to more fully consider the implications of the data: the stories
    it tells, the insights it reveals, or even the warnings it offers.'

- en: If you’re developing websites or web applications today, there’s a good chance
    you have data to communicate—data best presented in a good visualization. But
    how do you know what kind of visualization is appropriate? And even more importantly,
    how do you actually create one? In the chapters that follow, we explore dozens
    of different visualizations, techniques, and toolkits. Each example discusses
    the appropriateness of the visualization (and suggests possible alternatives)
    and provides step-by-step instructions for adding the visualization to your web
    pages.

    there are other authors far better qualified than me for that (Edward Tufte, for
    example). Instead, this book will focus on implementing visualizations. When appropriate,
    I’ll take a slightly bigger picture view to discuss the strengths and weaknesses
    of particular visualization strategies, but the main goal is to show you how to
    create a wide range of visualizations. (I recognize that sometimes the boss absolutely
    insists on a pie chart.)

- en: As you might guess from the title, this book focuses on how to use JavaScript
    code to create visualizations. The examples don’t assume you’re a JavaScript expert—and
    I’ll be sure to explain any code more complicated than a basic jQuery selector—but
    I won’t spend much time discussing styles for the visualizations. Fortunately,
    styling visualizations is pretty much the same as styling other web content. Basic
    experience with HTML and CSS will serve you well when you add visualizations to
    your pages.

- en: Most of the book’s examples are simple, straightforward visualizations. Complex
    visualizations can be engaging and compelling, but studying a lot of advanced
    code usually isn’t the best way to learn the craft. In these examples, I’ll try
    to stay as simple as possible so you can clearly see how to use the various tools
    and techniques. Simple doesn’t mean boring, however, and even the simplest visualizations
    can be enlightening and inspiring.

- en: When you begin building your own visualizations, you’ll discover that the real
    world is rarely as kind as you’d wish. Open source libraries have bugs, third-party
    servers have security issues, and not every user has updated to the latest and
    greatest web browser. I’ve addressed these realities in the examples in this book.
    I’ll show you how to accommodate older browsers when it’s practical, how to comply
    with security constraints such as Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), and how
    to work around bugs in other folks’ code.

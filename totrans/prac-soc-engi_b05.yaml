- en: These exercises are things I normally implement when teaching in-person classes.
    They seek to help students overcome the fear of breaking the proverbial ice with
    targets and condition them to ask for potentially sensitive information in on-the-spot
    or uncomfortable positions. Feel free to do these as you have time, and watch
    as your social engineering aptitude and comfort levels rise.

- en: When you are out and about, look for strangers trying to take selfies. Offer
    to help them. If they accept, prompt them to help you with something. I like using
    “anthropology surveys” or “word surveys for psychology class,” and ask some invasive
    questions, like their mother’s maiden name or passwords. I have noticed that I
    have better success in asking for a mother’s maiden name when phrasing it as “what
    was your mom’s name before she was married?” This tends to bypass the mental firewall
    rule about a mother’s maiden name.

    When doing onsite physical assessments and vishing, you have to think on your
    feet. Nothing ever goes as planned. Having improv experience helps you get used
    to adapting to awkward situations, which can occur without warning in these engagements.
    Remember the rule of improv: never say no.'

- en: Like improv, standup comedy helps with social engineering. The difference in
    the two disciplines is that one is rehearsed and the other is not. The benefit
    to standup comedy that improv lacks is that you have time to come up with your
    entire backstory in advance. But regular standup fails, and improv succeeds, when
    making stuff up on the fly. Both are important but give you different experiences.

- en: Speaking will always help. Getting comfortable in front of a group of varying
    sizes is to your advantage. Like doing improv, things will go wrong. You will
    have to work through and around the problems to succeed. You will also get used
    to communicating clearly and having more ways to convey a point.

- en: For example, the first time I gave my “Social Forensication” talk was at BSides
    Orlando in 2018\. Three slides into the presentation, my computer encountered
    a Blue Screen of Death. I panicked. After taking about 30 seconds to regain my
    composure, I explained the problem to the audience, and a friend came on stage
    and babysat my computer as it came back up. I was honest about this being my first
    time presenting the talk and explained that I was going to improvise from memory.
    The system came back up, and I was able to go through my slides to cover all my
    material in the allotted time. I had to cut out my demonstration but offered to
    do it in the hallway, and about 15 people came out to see it. Remarkably, that
    is not my worst speaking experience, just one that helped me grow.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Get permission from family and friends to collect OSINT on them. Depending on
    how close you are to them, you may be able to only refine your search methods
    and evaluate the fidelity of the data. I tend to solicit online friends I have
    never met in real life to make it a little more challenging. To make it worthwhile
    for those who let us collect OSINT on them, provide a report of what you find.
    It doesn’t have to be formal or in the template from Appendix B, but it should
    be something that proves what you found, where you found it, why it is a problem,
    and how to have it removed (if possible).

- en: Chris Hadnagy, who runs SEVillage at Defcon and as a standalone conference,
    has a social engineering CTF at both locations. Recon Village at Defcon and Defcon
    China have a CTF element. Chris Silvers runs OSINT CTFs at BSides Atlanta, GrrCON,
    NolaCon, and other conferences. When I do in-person training, I have an OSINT
    CTF element if the course is all day or more than a day.

- en: Another platform is the Trace Labs Search Party CTF. Trace Labs runs multiple
    global remote CTFs and partners with a variety of conferences to run them there.
    They maintain a Slack channel and have ongoing operations for members of the Slack
    in which law enforcement has stated that they are seeking help. There are a variety
    of Discord servers for OSINT and social engineering, including mine ([https://discord.com/invite/p78TTGa/](https://discord.com/invite/p78TTGa/)).

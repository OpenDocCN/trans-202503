<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">A</span>ndroid launched an early version of the SDK long before it shipped 1.0, or the source code, or any physical hardware. Launching the SDK early gave developers plenty of time to learn about Android and build and test their applications. Early access to the platform also gave the team a chance for feedback from developers, pointing out problems that needed to be fixed before 1.0. </p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c39-0001"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_312" title="312"/>November 5, 2007: The Open Handset Alliance</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">On November 5, Google announced the formation of the Open Handset Alliance.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnote-2" id="c39-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup> The OHA was an important step toward the ecosystem that the team envisioned. In stark opposition to the traditional model exemplified by Apple and Microsoft, where a single company controls the platform, the OHA promised to provide an open source platform that could be used by all companies. It was a collection of carriers, hardware manufacturers, and software companies, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile carriers, featuring companies like T-Mobile, Sprint Nextel, and Vodafone</li>
<li>Handset manufacturers, including ASUS, Samsung, and LG</li>
<li>Semiconductor companies (manufacturers of chips that are assembled into handsets), such as ARM and NVIDIA</li>
<li>Software companies, including Google and ACCESS<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnote-3" id="c39-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The announcement promised great things, but it was just a press release—lots of nice words, painting the picture of a bright future, with no actual product to show for it. </p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c39-0002">November 7–8: Industry Reception</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Existing players in the mobile space who weren’t part of the OHA didn’t appear to think much of the announcement. </p>
<p>On November 7, two days after the OHA announcement, John Forsyth, an executive at Symbian, the most prevalent mobile phone operating system in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_313" title="313"/>the world at that time, said in an interview with BBC, “Search and a mobile phone platform are completely different things. It’s costly, arduous, and at times a deeply unsexy job of supporting customers day by day in launching phones. That’s something there’s very little experience of in Google’s environment. They are talking about having a phone by the end of next year. It’s not one that is going to ignite developers.”</p>
<p>The following day, Steve Ballmer (then CEO of Microsoft) said during a news conference, “Their efforts are just some words on paper right now, it’s hard to do a very clear comparison [with Windows Mobile]. Right now they have a press release, we have many, many millions of customers, great software, many hardware devices.”</p>
<p>There seemed to be a general sense of <em>vaporware</em><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnote-4" id="c39-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup> in the air. Press releases are one thing, but shipping a phone platform is a different kettle of software fish.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c39-0003">November 11: SDK Launch</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">On November 11, six days after the OHA announcement, the Android SDK was released, with a build that was lovingly labeled <em>m3</em>.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnote-5" id="c39-footnoteref-5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>When the original OHA announcement went out, the SDK was completely ready. But the decision was made to do the press release first and let it float out there a few days before dropping the code. This allowed time for industry sentiment and general misbelief to fester. Six days later, the team shipped the actual software, making the announcement very real indeed.</p>
<p>Now that the SDK was out there, application developers could download it, tinker with it, and start building apps against it, but it wasn’t final by a long stretch. For example, that first release had an emulator that looked like the Sooner device (complete with a hardware keyboard taking up more space than the tiny screen, but that also had touch support the actual Sooner <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_314" title="314"/>device lacked). The emulator also had many functional apps already. Android really was a mostly complete system, albeit without a physical device to ship on and with APIs that were not yet final. </p>

</figure>
<p>In the third SDK version, <em>m3-r37a</em>, released just a month later, the emulator offered a more modern device with a larger touchscreen.</p><p>It’s worth noting that all of these SDKs are still available<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnote-6" id="c39-footnoteref-6">6</a></sup> on the <a class="LinkURL" href="https://www.android.com/">https://www.android.com/</a> website, including emulators that still run. Why you would want to spend time with these pre-release versions of Android is another <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_315" title="315"/>question, but it’s cool that you can; Android has always been about openness, and that apparently extends to obsolete versions of the operating system that never actually shipped with running hardware.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c39-0004">What’s in a Name?</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Naming products can be a difficult task, especially when lawyers get involved.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnote-7" id="c39-footnoteref-7">7</a></sup> It’s one thing to have an internal code name that the team uses. It can probably be anything, because the wider world may never know and there won’t be any conflicts with other people’s or companies’ own products or names.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnote-8" id="c39-footnoteref-8">8</a></sup> But when that internal product becomes external and public, things get complicated. You have to do trademark searches. When someone already has the rights to the name you wanted, you have to figure out what to do about it, which usually involves coming up with a new name.</p>
<p>In the weeks prior to launch, there was a fear that the name <em>Android</em> would not be available for use externally. Dianne said, “I remember us being really worried about the potential name change, because the word Android at that point was used everywhere—all over the SDK, everywhere. If we had to change it in our APIs it was going to be a mess.”</p>
<p>So the team brainstormed some other options, including <em>Mezza.</em><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnote-9" id="c39-footnoteref-9">9</a></sup> Dan Morrill explained the logic behind the name: “It was supposed to mean mezzanine,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnote-10" id="c39-footnoteref-10">10</a></sup> like enabling middleware. Needless to say, nobody liked it and the correct decision was ultimately reached.”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c39-0005"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_316" title="316"/>The Android Developer Challenge</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">One of the difficult things with launching a new software platform is actually getting anyone to use it. When the SDK was released, it had exactly zero users outside of the Android team in the entire world, and it would be many months until that number could possibly change, since Android devices would not be available to purchase until 1.0 was released. The team had to figure out how to get developers interested in investing their time and energy in this new and speculative platform with zero users.</p>
<p>So the team came up with the Android Developer Challenge. The first blog post about Android, on November 12, 2007, ended with a tantalizing hook: <em>“We’re really looking forward to seeing all the amazing applications that developers will create on an open mobile phone platform. In fact, you may even want to enter your application into the </em><em>Android Developer Challenge—a USD $10 million challenge sponsored by Google to support and recognize developers who build great applications for the Android platform.”</em></p>
<p>On January 3, 2008, the contest officially opened. The team accepted entries until April 14 and then sent them off to judges around the world to come up with the short list of the top 50 apps. Those 50 developers were awarded $25,000 each and asked to submit for a second round. From that second round, the top 10 apps were awarded $275,000 each, and the second 10 $100,000 each. If you do the math, that’s five million dollars Google gave away in this single contest.</p>
<p>Whether the team got their money’s worth is difficult to say, since these apps couldn’t even be offered to users at that point. Nobody outside of Android could even get a device that would run these apps at that time; the finalists were announced in August of 2008, a full two months before the first G1 was available for sale. But the challenge definitely got developers interested, as 1,788 apps were entered into the contest for this platform with zero users and an unknown release date.</p>
<p>The exercise benefited Android not only in developer excitement about the platform; the experience of onboarding all of these developers and getting their feedback also helped the platform team get things in better shape for the eventual launch of 1.0. Dirk Dougherty explained: “We had to figure out how to write apps, and then explain that. And deal with all the feedback. We think we get a lot of feedback today, but this was a brand-new API surface, on a brand-new platform, and no one had really written apps with this <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_317" title="317"/>kind of access to sensors and things like that before. So there were tons of new use cases that we hadn’t thought of.”</p>
<p>Even the process of judging the apps was . . . unique. Google wanted to use judges across the world that were known to the developer community. They wanted to make things easy for these remote judges, but Android wasn’t “easy” at that point at all. To run an application, a judge had to install the SDK on their computer, run the tools, boot up the emulator, run a command to load the app into the emulator, and launch the app. With nearly 1,800 apps to judge, that wasn’t going to scale.</p>
<p>So Google sent laptops to every judge, pre-installed with a tool that Dan Morrill’s developer relations team had written that launched the emulator and had a UI to choose the app to test, which installed and ran it on the emulator. “We shipped out a laptop to every one of the judges around the world. It was crazy! Most of these laptops never came back. One came back in a box packed with all kinds of stuffed animals, for some reason.”</p>
<p>The top 50 winners of the preliminary round are still listed on the Android developers blog;<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnote-11" id="c39-footnoteref-11">11</a></sup> the first one on the list is “AndroidScan” by the Android team’s very own Jeff Sharkey.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnote-12" id="c39-footnoteref-12">12</a></sup> No, he didn’t cheat by entering the contest as a Google employee: Jeff was recruited by the platform team because the team saw his work in the contest. “I was invited to Mountain View to develop on confidential devices (the G1). I was so excited I didn’t actually work on the app while in Mountain View. Instead, I wrote another app<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnote-13" id="c39-footnoteref-13">13</a></sup> that would do area-code-to-city caller ID lookup using a super optimized algorithm that didn’t require a network connection.” Jeff continued work on AndroidScan later, renaming it CompareEverywhere, and ended up being one of the 10 overall winners.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_318" title="318"/>Once the contest was over, the team continued finishing up the product, shipping 1.0 in October of 2008. In May of 2009, they ran a second challenge, giving away another five million dollars. But in the meantime, Android had attracted actual users and Android Market was open for business. Now Android had a real user and developer base, not just contestants for a pre-release platform.</p>

There is even a “What’s New” section on the home page, with the most recent press release update on July 18, 2011 . . . which is an indicator of the relevance of that organization in today’s Android ecosystem. But it was an important piece of Android’s history and growth.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnoteref-3" id="c39-footnote-3">3.</a></sup>  I was amused to see ACCESS on the list. This company was mentioned earlier as the company that acquired PalmSource, Inc., after which several disenchanted ex-Be employees left to join Android.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnoteref-4" id="c39-footnote-4">4.</a></sup>  There is a long and sad tradition in tech of announcing a product way too early, when it may not even yet exist in anything but dream form, hence the term <em>vaporware</em>. Maybe they do it out of hope, or fear, but companies do sometimes present products way too early and end up having to retract those promises later, when reality catches up.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnoteref-5" id="c39-footnote-5">5.</a></sup>  <em>m3</em> stands for milestone 3. <em>m1</em> and <em>m2</em> were internal milestone releases. Later releases were follow-ons from m3 (bugfix releases), then m5 (when APIs were changed). The milestone naming was dropped by the time the final beta version shipped, which was just called <em>.9</em>. </p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnoteref-6" id="c39-footnote-6">6.</a></sup>  Or at least they are now, when I am <em>writing</em> this footnote, many years after these SDKs were released. Whether they are still available when you are <em>reading</em> this footnote is not clear. The future is like many software projects: it’s difficult to predict exactly what it’s going to be like, but we’ll find out eventually.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnoteref-7" id="c39-footnote-7">7.</a></sup>  There are other examples of this difficulty in Android history, such as the use of the word “Nexus” for Google’s line of Android phones, which was challenged by the estate of the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnoteref-8" id="c39-footnote-8">8.</a></sup>  Even internal names can sometimes be problematic. Apple once used the code name “Carl Sagan” for one of its computer systems in the early 90s and was sued by . . . Carl Sagan. The team changed the code name to BHA, which stood for “Butt-Head Astronomer.”</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnoteref-9" id="c39-footnote-9">9.</a></sup>  Another name being considered was Honeycomb, which would return in 2011 as the dessert name for the 3.0 release.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnoteref-10" id="c39-footnote-10">10.</a></sup>  Mezzanine is better than my guess when I first saw it, which was, “Meh.” Mezzo is an Italian word I remember from far too many years practicing classical piano. I’d read it in the dynamics specified for a section of music, like <em>mf</em> for <em>mezzo forte</em>, which means “kinda loud.” Mezzo isn’t even a specific thing, it’s just an adjective meaning half. And "mezza" itself isn’t even a word. So, meh indeed.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c39-footnoteref-11" id="c39-footnote-11">11.</a></sup>  If you’re ever curious about details in Android history that aren’t in the book, all of the old blogs are out there.

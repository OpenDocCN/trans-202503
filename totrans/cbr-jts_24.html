</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="ChapterIntro">The shinobi scrolls are filled with details about how to bypass a target’s security personnel. To a shinobi in the field, no defensive impediment is quite as pressing—or as complicated—as an enemy’s guards. While the scrolls instruct shinobi to work in blind spots that guards cannot monitor or protect easily, the most exploitable gaps stem not from poor military strategy or lack of manpower but from guards’ negligence and lack of discipline.</p>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="186" id="Page_186"/>The scrolls advise seeking out guards who are observably tired, lazy, poorly organized, ignorant of shinobi techniques, or complacent. There are any number of ways to assess and exploit guard capabilities. Among other techniques, <em>Bansenshūkai </em>recommends:<sup class="endnote"><a id="c24-noteref-178" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-178">1</a></sup></p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>Whispering near guards to test their attentiveness, then monitoring their reaction for at least one hour to gauge their response methods and capabilities</li>&#13;
<li>Identifying negligent guards who act on signals from hidden guards, exposing the presence of embedded defenders such as listening or smelling scouts</li>&#13;
<li>Targeting guardhouses where guards speak loudly, converse incessantly, or drink or party to excess, all of which indicates inexperience or negligence</li>&#13;
<li>Waiting for or causing an event that compels guards to abandon their post</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>The same scroll also advises shinobi to observe guards’ conduct, movements, bearings, and actions to infer more about their discipline. For instance, if the moat and surrounding perimeter of a castle are kept clean, clear, and well lit, then the guards are likely vigilant and practice defensive hygiene. But if commonly known castle entry points such as corners, spillways, and sewage outlets are not protected, it could be a sign that the guards or their commanders neglect their duties.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c24-noteref-179" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-179">2</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p>Infiltrating enemy guardhouses gave shinobi crucial insight into improving guard discipline, behavior, and capability in their own defenses. Again, the scrolls cite guards’ negligence and laziness as the biggest obstacles to a successful defense, and they put the onus for overcoming those vices on lords or commanders, whose strict discipline, tough training, and thorough attention to detail could give their guards the requisite mental toughness to defend against enemy threats, including other shinobi.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c24-noteref-180" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-180">3</a></sup> “Every single thing is decided by your own mind and by the way that you think,” say the ninja poems. “If you always assume that you are facing the enemy, you will never drop your guard in any way.” <sup class="endnote"><a id="c24-noteref-181" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-181">4</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p>In this chapter, we will compare the guardhouses of shinobi times to the security operations centers (SOCs) of today. We will touch on the modernization of security, which has shifted security responsibility to all employees instead of just security personnel. We’ll review methods by which an external threat actor can detect poor security controls/practices on networks. In addition, we’ll present some theory around the direct interaction between security staff and adversaries—particularly if the adversary can infiltrate SOC/IR ticket systems—as well as other ideas about how adversaries may be able to judge the vigilance of the SOC. <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="187" id="Page_187"/>Most importantly, we discuss why security staff behavior is so important, why it may degrade over time, and how to establish a culture of security excellence.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-500549c24-0001">Security Operations Center Issues and Expectations</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">It is especially easy for cybersecurity and IT personnel to become lazy, complacent, negligent, tired, or burned out in their jobs. Why? There are myriad reasons.</p>&#13;
<p>One of the biggest is an unfortunate reality of human nature: if no one is looking over their shoulder, many workers simply shirk their duties. Lazy cybersecurity professionals have ample cover. Their tasks are largely invisible to their colleagues—even their supervisors. Many operation centers are isolated behind locked doors where employees work, relax, or even sleep without anyone knowing the difference. Their networks and machines exist on separate VLANs or “research” boxes that allow them to freely browse the internet without logging, inspection, or filtering.</p>&#13;
<p>The industry’s heavy reliance on process can also lull employees into a state of negligence or complacency. Through procedural repetition, security staff develop familiarities, habits, and narrowed ideas of what it means to defend their organization. While this tendency stems from the necessary routines of everyday work, it also results in highly specialized single-tool or single-approach defenders  who don’t consider attackers’ techniques and tools outside the scope of their own daily experience. Such a limited mindset leaves an organization with considerable security gaps.</p>&#13;
<p>Driven employees have the opposite problem. For them, working in a competitive field that demands deep specialized knowledge, ability, and ambition raises the risk of burnout. After tiresome months spent hunting for threats and incidents, it becomes easy to lose focus, rely on known concepts, wait to act until there is a security systems or software alert, or learn only what is necessary to report or remediate specific security incidents as they appear.</p>&#13;
<p>Cyber professionals aren’t the sole arbiters of computer literacy and security awareness; all employees share this responsibility. Unfortunately, this means the laziness and negligence of nontechnical employees is often a bigger security threat to an organization than a malicious external actor. These employees may inadvertently expose their company’s network or systems to threats by carelessly clicking on phishing emails or plugging in foreign USB drives they find in the parking lot. If management does not enforce security vigilance and discipline when appropriate, then conscientious employees are forced to operate in a culture in which careless employees abound and may even be rewarded. Success at <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="188" id="Page_188"/>these organizations becomes a game of attrition, wherein employees are promoted for surviving the longest without burning out or quitting. This environment compromises the work ethic, discipline, and integrity of the effective workers and degrades the entire workforce, allowing threat actors to exploit the many gaps these nonvigilant employees create.</p>&#13;
<p>Leadership buy-in and competency significantly boost employee morale and security vigilance, just as poor leadership decisions or organizational strategies can weaken security posture and degrade employee trust. Attempts to improve defensive blind spots or weaknesses typically require interdepartmental cooperation, shared budgets, weekend hours, and inconveniences that lead employees to complain and resist the initiatives. As a result, worn down, defeated security engineers become cynical about security improvements and turn a blind eye to existing deficiencies. Some may even wait for an incident to occur, knowing their organization’s reactive security posture means they won’t be allowed to make improvements unless something bad happens first.</p>&#13;
<p>It can be easy for threat actors to assess an organization’s security vigilance from externally observable indicators, such as:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>Too much information leaked through error messages on websites</li>&#13;
<li>Password policy details leaked upon login</li>&#13;
<li>Lack of security policy header content</li>&#13;
<li>Improperly self-signed certificates</li>&#13;
<li>Misconfigured email Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)/Sender Policy Framework (SPF)</li>&#13;
<li>Poorly configured DNS records</li>&#13;
<li>Exposed management interfaces on internet-facing servers, security devices, or networking hardware</li>&#13;
<li>Disclosure of technology versions or security used</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>To counteract a tendency toward lack of vigilance, defenders must constantly self-assess and strive for improvement. While managers don’t always praise or reward staff who implement additional security, ongoing vigilance sends a message to adversaries that an organization’s first line of defense is strong and hints that interior defenses may be even stronger.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-500549c24-0002">Influencing Behavior</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">How employees respond in the workplace is influenced by their own beliefs, the culture at work, and conditioning over time from their learned experiences. Shaping work culture by reinforcing behavior selectively and <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="189" id="Page_189"/>implementing meaningful work-feedback loops will encourage employees toward excellence. The lack of feedback, especially of positive feedback, may be the most challenging issue to address in security, as it can be easy for a defender’s behavior to slide into a low-energy state of security nihilism. This can result from a lack of positive reinforcement for good behavior. Perhaps the only inputs received by the security staff are compliance audits and KPI numbers, which don’t represent the utility of their actions. The results of good performance, like stopping adversaries from robbing the organization of intellectual property or money, can take years to manifest and thus can be hard to build on. Listed below is guidance on how to improve and sustain good security behaviors.</p>&#13;
<ol class="decimal">&#13;
<li value="1"><em>Set standards and develop your culture. </em>The US Department of Defense (DoD) has fostered a culture that prioritizes security vigilance. Ex-DoD employees who move to other organizations regularly describe experiencing culture shock when they encounter security negligence in their new workplace (and unfortunately eventually reduce their standards, accepting the new culture). Review the DoD’s <em>Cybersecurity Culture and Compliance Initiative</em><sup class="endnote"><a id="c24-noteref-182" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-182">5</a></sup> and determine which of its elements could help your organization establish a culture of security vigilance. Some possible attributes to call out explicitly include:&#13;
<ol class="none">&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead"><b>Integrity</b> </span>  Encourage staff to report mistakes when they happen. For instance, an employee who accidentally compromises the security of a network should not feel a need to hide the incident for fear of losing their job. Rather, they should feel safe enough to admit their mistake and help the organization fortify the security gap.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead"><b>Competence</b> </span>  Establish baseline educational standards for everyone who operates in cyberspace. These should inform all employees’ daily behavior, empower people to identify security risks, and facilitate smart decision making through ongoing cybersecurity education. Note that establishing a core competency for your organization could mean preventing those who do not demonstrate competency from holding certain positions.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead"><b>Professionalism</b> </span>  To maintain a standard of excellence and a culture of vigilance, require that staff hold themselves accountable for their work and not take shortcuts.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead"><b>Questioning attitudes</b> </span>  Hire people who do not accept things as they are but rather question, analyze, and interpret their <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="190" id="Page_190"/>observations. Ensure that staff feel safe to speak up without being quickly dismissed or made to feel stupid.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li value="2"><em>Enforce discipline. </em>Security negligence affects more than one person’s work performance or product. It puts entire organizations at risk. <em>Bansenshūkai</em>’s “Six Points on Behavior in the Guardhouse” says, “Strict rules should be adhered to, and in the case where there is someone who is not vigilant, he should be punished severely.”<sup class="endnote"><a id="c24-noteref-183" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-183">6</a></sup> Establish a formal procedure to identify and punish cybersecurity violations and nonvigilant practices by users, security, IT, and leadership. Avoid the temptation to scapegoat the chief information security officer (CISO) or other personnel when there is a security incident, as doing so sabotages a culture in which everyone feels accountable.</li>&#13;
<li value="3"><em>Establish formal processes, procedures, and compliance. </em>Identify, document, and disseminate the tasks, rules, and policies you want your security team to follow and enforce. Determine ways to measure whether employees are complying with these standards. Avoid using shallow key performance indicators (KPIs) such as how many tickets are filed or how many security incidents are investigated, as these metrics do not meaningfully judge work. Install leadership that understands and cares about security, dedicates time to build vigilance, and identifies noncompliance.</li>&#13;
<li value="4"><em>Drive agency and engagement. </em>Many corporate employees do not feel engaged at work. They don’t take part in decisions, don’t act in the interests of the organization, and aren’t invested in the company’s success (or their own). Boredom is a common issue in security—one that can often be alleviated by removing obstacles that deter or demotivate staff from taking proactive security actions. Empower security staff by allowing them to:&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>Experiment with new security controls, routines, and concepts</li>&#13;
<li>Learn new technologies, techniques, and tools</li>&#13;
<li>Find meaning in their work </li>&#13;
<li>Experience positive outcomes, such as a path for career development or promotions</li>&#13;
<li>Participate in strategic risk decisions</li>&#13;
<li>Conduct blue team, red team (for example, purple teaming), or other simulations and exercises so they can provide positive input to each other</li>&#13;
<li>Celebrate success in finding security flaws </li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;

<h2><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="191" id="Page_191"/>Castle Theory Thought Exercise</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Consider the scenario in which you are the ruler of a medieval castle with valuable assets inside. While patrolling your castle, you notice that spears are oddly arranged in some of the guardhouses, and you suspect that some of the night watch guards have devised a way to prop themselves up on supporting spears, allowing them to relax or sleep while appearing upright and awake at their posts. You have received no reports of sleeping guards—or of any other guard staff misconduct—nor are you aware of any recent security incidents.</p>&#13;
<p>What evidence, if any, do you need before you take measures to improve security, processes, and personnel? How might you gauge the alertness of your guards? What security information could you have guards study during their shift to ensure they do not sleep? How would you solicit honest feedback from guards on how to improve their attentiveness and engagement? How would you punish a single guard who sleeps during night watch, and how would you punish an entire regiment that does the same? How do you establish a culture of trust and integrity so your guards feel they can tell you when something is wrong without fear of punishment? </p>&#13;

</ol>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-500549c24-0003">Recommended Security Controls and Mitigations</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Where relevant, recommendations are presented with applicable security controls from the NIST 800-53 standard. Each should be evaluated with the concept of guardhouse behavior in mind.</p>&#13;
<ol class="decimal">&#13;
<li value="1">Develop, document, and provide security training, procedures, and rules of behavior to all staff. Create specific training and procedures for roles with significant security responsibilities, such as development, IT, security, and leadership positions. Enforce strict disciplinary measures for failure to comply with security policy and procedures. [AT-1: Awareness and Training Policy and Procedures; AT-2: Awareness Training; AT-3: Role-Based Training; IR-2: Incident Response Training; PL-4: Rules of Behavior; SA-16: Developer-Provided Training] </li>&#13;
<li value="2">Conduct performance-based tests of security responsiveness, posture, and tool capability with specialized security assessments, scans, pen tests, and red teams. This activity identifies processes or procedures not being followed, security blind spots, and unvigilant staff members. [CA-2: Assessments | (2) Specialized Assessments; CA-8: Penetration Testing; IR-3: Incident Response <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="192" id="Page_192"/>Testing; RA-5: Vulnerability Scanning; SC-7: Boundary Protection | (10) Test Exfiltration; SI-4: System Monitoring | Testing of Monitoring Tools and Mechanisms; SI-6: Security and Privacy Function] </li>&#13;
<li value="3">Create training programs and exercises to continually improve your security staff’s knowledge, skill set, and competency. [CA-8: Penetration Testing; IR-3: Incident Response Testing | (3) Continuous Improvement; PM-12: Insider Threat Program; PM-13: Security and Privacy Workforce; PM-14: Testing, Training, and Monitoring; PM-16: Threat Awareness Program]</li>&#13;
<li value="4">Allow security staff to determine which configurations and controls should be changed to improve security. Put the burden on system owners, maintainers, and developers to provide strong, evidence-based arguments as to why changes recommended by security staff cannot be implemented. [CM-3: Configuration Change Control]</li>&#13;
<li value="5">Implement a policy and process for addressing security staff complaints. This feedback helps security improve processes by revising or rolling back improper controls. It also provides users with a way to identify security concerns and alert security staff without fear of repercussions. [PM-28: Complaint Management]</li>&#13;
<li value="6">Require that security personnel practice OPSEC to protect key operational, configuration, and deployment information, while taking care not to reveal OPSEC to adversaries who may be testing security defenses. [SC-38: Operations Security] </li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-500549c24-0004">Debrief</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, we looked at the ways in which shinobi probed guards and guardhouses to assess infiltration opportunities based on their target’s security standards (or lack thereof). We reviewed how hundreds of years ago, as today, it was commonplace for guards to become complacent in their duties and how skilled infiltrators were able to take advantage of this complacency. In addition, we touched on the ways culture can shape an organization’s ability to defend itself; this concept was given paramount importance in the philosophy of shinobi. Shinobi culture was then compared to modern SOCs and InfoSec work cultures, which have issues that today’s cyber adversaries are likely to exploit. We also described several methods and best practices for establishing and maintaining a culture of security excellence.</p>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="193" id="Page_193"/>In the next chapter, we will discuss the shinobi principal of “stranger danger”—of not allowing anyone suspicious to approach. Repeating this message to create a culture of security, while also implementing strict controls to prevent suspicious events from becoming malicious, is a demonstration of organizational security excellence. </p>&#13;

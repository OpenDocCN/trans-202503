- en: To build this circuit, all you need is a battery, a resistor, and an LED. The
    resistor reduces the amount of current that flows through the LED. You’ll always
    want a resistor in series with an LED, but it doesn’t matter whether you place
    it before or after the LED. When you add a resistor in series with a circuit,
    you get less current in the whole circuit. If you don’t use a resistor, you risk
    breaking the LED.

    at a resistor, you’ll notice it has several colored bands. These colors tell you
    the value of the resistor. To find a 470 Ω resistor, look for a resistor that
    has colored bands in this order: yellow, purple, brown, and gold or silver (see
    [Figure 1](build.xhtml#buildfig1)).'

    It doesn’t matter which pin you place where; the resistor can be connected either
    way around.

    *anode* and *cathode*. For the LED to work, you need to connect the anode to the
    positive side (+) of the battery and the cathode to the negative side (–). For
    simplicity’s sake, let’s call them the positive pin and the negative pin of the
    LED. I’ve marked them in [Figure 3](build.xhtml#buildfig3).

- en: There are two ways to tell which pin is which. Look closely at your LED. If
    one pin is longer than the other, that’s the positive side. If both pins are the
    same length, look more closely at the round edge at the bottom of the plastic
    housing. One side of the housing should be flat, as in [Figure 3](build.xhtml#buildfig3);
    that’s the negative pin. If you’re still having a hard time distinguishing between
    the two pins, place the LED on a flat surface and roll it so you can find the
    flat side.

    pin to column H, row 10\. Check your connections against [Figure 4](build.xhtml#buildfig4).

    of the breadboard to the appropriate rows in the right-hand component area.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you look at the circuit diagram again, you can see that you need to connect
    the positive terminal of the battery to the top-most lead of the resistor—the
    lead in row 1\. So use a jumper wire to connect row 1 to the positive column in
    the supply area. It’s common to use the column with a red line next to it as the
    positive one (to match the red wire of the battery clip). Then connect the LED’s
    negative pin—in row 10—to the negative column in the supply area. Use [Figure
    5](build.xhtml#buildfig5) as a reference.

    of the red and black wires does not touch. Next, connect the red wire from your
    battery clip to the positive column of the right-hand supply area. Finally, connect
    the black wire from your battery clip to the negative column. Check your circuit
    against [Figure 6](build.xhtml#buildfig6).

    the table in “[Resistor Color Codes](back02.xhtml#back02)” on [page 64](back02.xhtml#page_64).
    Your resistor should be 470 Ω.

    happen easily if you connect it directly to the battery—that is, without putting
    it in series with a resistor. Replace your LED and try again.

- en: Now that you’ve built your first breadboard circuit, you’re almost ready to
    move on to this book’s nine circuit projects. First, though, I recommend that
    you play around a little with the circuit you built in this chapter. Try to really
    understand why those connections make the circuit work. Understanding this is
    crucial to building the rest of the circuits in this book. A good test is to see
    if you can build the circuit again in the *left-hand* component and power supply
    areas, just by looking at the circuit diagram.

    jumper wires, a battery, and a battery clip. But for simplicity’s sake, you won’t
    see these components in the parts list.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The circuits are sorted by difficulty, starting from the easiest. The challenge
    is to figure out how to connect each of the circuits on the breadboard. Some of
    the later circuits might be challenging if you don’t have any previous experience
    with circuits, but the trick is to not give up.

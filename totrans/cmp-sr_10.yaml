- en: Spotify is a popular website for listening to music. It offers a free service
    that lets you listen to particular songs or artists, with the compromise that
    you have to listen to occasional advertisements between tracks. You can choose
    to pay a small monthly fee to subscribe to Spotify and get rid of these occasional
    ads.

    in the list, if you don’t like the song you’re currently listening to. To the
    left of the pause button is a *previous* button that lets you return to the previous
    song. This can be useful if you’ve accidentally skipped a song you like or if

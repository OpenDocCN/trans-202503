<span class="blue">CHAPTER 3</span>
<br />
STORIES</strong>
</h2>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="noindent">You can make your own stories with ScratchJr by adding dialogue and new scenes to your animations. Invent new characters who talk to each other and travel to new places, just like in a storybook. With ScratchJr, you can make these stories come to life and play out before your eyes like a movie!</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_52"></a>
 In the six activities in this chapter, you’ll learn how to make your characters talk, how to move them through scenes, and how to control the speed and timing in your project.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, we’ll create a “Tortoise and the Hare” story project that uses all of these features.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec19">
<strong>ACTIVITY 6: FIND YOUR VOICE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Have the cat perform a show with words and sounds! You can record a song or sound for the cat to perform and write words in speech bubbles for the cat to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec35">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to record sounds for your character and how to make speech bubbles that show your character talking.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec36"><a id="page_53"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the theatre background. Then, start the cat’s script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">2. Tap the green blocks category to show the <em>sound blocks</em>
 in the palette. Tap the <strong>Microphone</strong>
 button to go into the ScratchJr recording studio.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Here you can tap the <strong>Record</strong>
 button to record a sound, tap the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button to stop recording, and tap the <strong>Play</strong>
 button to play the sound you recorded.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The green sound bars show you how loud the sounds are while you’re recording them. More green bars mean a louder sound recording.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_54"></a>
 4. When you are happy with your sound, tap the check mark to save it. Your sound will be saved as a new Play Recorded Sound block that you can add to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. You can also have your characters talk with speech bubbles. Tap the purple blocks category to reveal the looks blocks in the palette. Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area and snap it onto the end of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the white box under the speech bubble and delete the text there by tapping the backspace key. Now type what you want the cat to say and tap <strong>Go</strong>
 . If you type a longer speech for your character to say, the speech bubble will appear on the stage for longer so that you have time to read it all.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_55"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re ready, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to see the show!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec37">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Before you have saved your recording, you can play it back to hear it. If you don’t like it, simply press the Record button again to record another sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Play Recorded Sound blocks appear in the green palette only after you have recorded a sound and saved it. You can keep up to five sounds for each character on each page of a project. (You’ll learn how to add multiple pages in “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_58">page 58</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_56"></a>
 If you want to delete a sound, press and hold (<em>long-press</em>
 ) the Play Recorded Sound block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You will see a red X appear. Tap the X to delete the sound.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec38">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you make sounds and speech bubbles play at the same time? Make two scripts for the same character. Put both scripts in the character’s programming area and begin both scripts with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, but don’t connect them together!</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: one script should have only Play Recorded Sound blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_57"><a id="page_57" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb17">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec20"><a id="page_58"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec42">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Does your story have a title? Let’s add one to the stage! Tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top and type the title of your tale.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can change the size of your title by tapping the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button, which looks like three A’s. You can also change the color of your title by tapping the <strong>Change Color</strong>
 button, which looks like a paint bucket. Try it!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_65"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can move the text around the page by dragging it, just like you can with a character. You could even write something on the whiteboard in the classroom!</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb20">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING YOUR OWN STORIES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use ScratchJr to tell a story that actually happened to you! Use multiple pages to make sure your story has a beginning, middle, and end. Try including more pictures and words to tell your story. Don’t forget to share it with a friend when you’re all done!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb21">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEQUENCING YOUR STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make new pages and put them in order. Practice counting forward each time your story moves to the next page. How many pages does your story have? Are your pages in the correct order?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb22">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button. If you are on a different page when you tap the Green Flag button, the action will start on that page and continue to the end, without going through the first part of your story.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec21"><a id="page_67"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_71"><a id="page_71" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb23">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>
 ” on <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#page_58">page 58</a>
 if you need a reminder of how to move from <a style=";color:black;" href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a style=";color:black;" href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>
<div class="image"></div>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_76"><a id="page_76" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ASKING QUESTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As you are using the paint editor, you may need extra help finding the tool that you want. Don’t be afraid to ask your classmates or an adult!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb33">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE CIRCLES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the circles as you add them to the snowman to make sure that the three circles of the body plus the two circles of the eyes make five circles.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb34">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one. Try selecting a more visible color just to show them how the Fill tool works. Then go back to white and fill the circles for the snowman.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="noindent">You can make your own stories with ScratchJr by adding dialogue and new scenes to your animations. Invent new characters who talk to each other and travel to new places, just like in a storybook. With ScratchJr, you can make these stories come to life and play out before your eyes like a movie!</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_52"></a>
 In the six activities in this chapter, you’ll learn how to make your characters talk, how to move them through scenes, and how to control the speed and timing in your project.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, we’ll create a “Tortoise and the Hare” story project that uses all of these features.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec19">
<strong>ACTIVITY 6: FIND YOUR VOICE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Have the cat perform a show with words and sounds! You can record a song or sound for the cat to perform and write words in speech bubbles for the cat to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec35">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to record sounds for your character and how to make speech bubbles that show your character talking.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec36"><a id="page_53"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the theatre background. Then, start the cat’s script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">2. Tap the green blocks category to show the <em>sound blocks</em>
 in the palette. Tap the <strong>Microphone</strong>
 button to go into the ScratchJr recording studio.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Here you can tap the <strong>Record</strong>
 button to record a sound, tap the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button to stop recording, and tap the <strong>Play</strong>
 button to play the sound you recorded.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The green sound bars show you how loud the sounds are while you’re recording them. More green bars mean a louder sound recording.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_54"></a>
 4. When you are happy with your sound, tap the check mark to save it. Your sound will be saved as a new Play Recorded Sound block that you can add to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. You can also have your characters talk with speech bubbles. Tap the purple blocks category to reveal the looks blocks in the palette. Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area and snap it onto the end of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the white box under the speech bubble and delete the text there by tapping the backspace key. Now type what you want the cat to say and tap <strong>Go</strong>
 . If you type a longer speech for your character to say, the speech bubble will appear on the stage for longer so that you have time to read it all.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_55"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re ready, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to see the show!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec37">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Before you have saved your recording, you can play it back to hear it. If you don’t like it, simply press the Record button again to record another sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Play Recorded Sound blocks appear in the green palette only after you have recorded a sound and saved it. You can keep up to five sounds for each character on each page of a project. (You’ll learn how to add multiple pages in “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_58">page 58</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_56"></a>
 If you want to delete a sound, press and hold (<em>long-press</em>
 ) the Play Recorded Sound block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You will see a red X appear. Tap the X to delete the sound.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec38">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you make sounds and speech bubbles play at the same time? Make two scripts for the same character. Put both scripts in the character’s programming area and begin both scripts with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, but don’t connect them together!</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: one script should have only Play Recorded Sound blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_57"><a id="page_57" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb17">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec20"><a id="page_58"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec42">

 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb17">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button. If you are on a different page when you tap the Green Flag button, the action will start on that page and continue to the end, without going through the first part of your story.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Lastly, we’ll create a “Tortoise and the Hare” story project that uses all of these features.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec19">
<strong>ACTIVITY 6: FIND YOUR VOICE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Have the cat perform a show with words and sounds! You can record a song or sound for the cat to perform and write words in speech bubbles for the cat to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec35">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to record sounds for your character and how to make speech bubbles that show your character talking.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec36"><a id="page_53"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the theatre background. Then, start the cat’s script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">2. Tap the green blocks category to show the <em>sound blocks</em>
 in the palette. Tap the <strong>Microphone</strong>
 button to go into the ScratchJr recording studio.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Here you can tap the <strong>Record</strong>
 button to record a sound, tap the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button to stop recording, and tap the <strong>Play</strong>
 button to play the sound you recorded.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The green sound bars show you how loud the sounds are while you’re recording them. More green bars mean a louder sound recording.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_54"></a>
 4. When you are happy with your sound, tap the check mark to save it. Your sound will be saved as a new Play Recorded Sound block that you can add to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. You can also have your characters talk with speech bubbles. Tap the purple blocks category to reveal the looks blocks in the palette. Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area and snap it onto the end of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the white box under the speech bubble and delete the text there by tapping the backspace key. Now type what you want the cat to say and tap <strong>Go</strong>
 . If you type a longer speech for your character to say, the speech bubble will appear on the stage for longer so that you have time to read it all.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_55"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re ready, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to see the show!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec37">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Before you have saved your recording, you can play it back to hear it. If you don’t like it, simply press the Record button again to record another sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Play Recorded Sound blocks appear in the green palette only after you have recorded a sound and saved it. You can keep up to five sounds for each character on each page of a project. (You’ll learn how to add multiple pages in “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_58">page 58</a>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_56"></a>
 If you want to delete a sound, press and hold (<em>long-press</em>
 ) the Play Recorded Sound block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You will see a red X appear. Tap the X to delete the sound.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec38">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you make sounds and speech bubbles play at the same time? Make two scripts for the same character. Put both scripts in the character’s programming area and begin both scripts with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, but don’t connect them together!</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: one script should have only Play Recorded Sound blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb17">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec20"><a id="page_58"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec42">

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb22">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button. If you are on a different page when you tap the Green Flag button, the action will start on that page and continue to the end, without going through the first part of your story.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>

<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to record sounds for your character and how to make speech bubbles that show your character talking.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec36"><a id="page_53"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the theatre background. Then, start the cat’s script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">2. Tap the green blocks category to show the <em>sound blocks</em>
 in the palette. Tap the <strong>Microphone</strong>
 button to go into the ScratchJr recording studio.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Here you can tap the <strong>Record</strong>
 button to record a sound, tap the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button to stop recording, and tap the <strong>Play</strong>
 button to play the sound you recorded.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The green sound bars show you how loud the sounds are while you’re recording them. More green bars mean a louder sound recording.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_54"></a>
 4. When you are happy with your sound, tap the check mark to save it. Your sound will be saved as a new Play Recorded Sound block that you can add to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. You can also have your characters talk with speech bubbles. Tap the purple blocks category to reveal the looks blocks in the palette. Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area and snap it onto the end of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the white box under the speech bubble and delete the text there by tapping the backspace key. Now type what you want the cat to say and tap <strong>Go</strong>
 . If you type a longer speech for your character to say, the speech bubble will appear on the stage for longer so that you have time to read it all.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_55"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re ready, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec37">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Before you have saved your recording, you can play it back to hear it. If you don’t like it, simply press the Record button again to record another sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Play Recorded Sound blocks appear in the green palette only after you have recorded a sound and saved it. You can keep up to five sounds for each character on each page of a project. (You’ll learn how to add multiple pages in “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec38">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you make sounds and speech bubbles play at the same time? Make two scripts for the same character. Put both scripts in the character’s programming area and begin both scripts with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, but don’t connect them together!</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: one script should have only Play Recorded Sound blocks.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb17">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 have the cat build the bottom snowball, on <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 have the cat add the middle snowball, and on <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 have the cat put on the snowman’s head and arms.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the theatre background. Then, start the cat’s script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">2. Tap the green blocks category to show the <em>sound blocks</em>
 in the palette. Tap the <strong>Microphone</strong>
 button to go into the ScratchJr recording studio.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Here you can tap the <strong>Record</strong>

 button to play the sound you recorded.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The green sound bars show you how loud the sounds are while you’re recording them. More green bars mean a louder sound recording.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_54"></a>
 4. When you are happy with your sound, tap the check mark to save it. Your sound will be saved as a new Play Recorded Sound block that you can add to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. You can also have your characters talk with speech bubbles. Tap the purple blocks category to reveal the looks blocks in the palette. Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area and snap it onto the end of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the white box under the speech bubble and delete the text there by tapping the backspace key. Now type what you want the cat to say and tap <strong>Go</strong>
 . If you type a longer speech for your character to say, the speech bubble will appear on the stage for longer so that you have time to read it all.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_55"></a>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb17">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>

<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button. If you are on a different page when you tap the Green Flag button, the action will start on that page and continue to the end, without going through the first part of your story.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to record sounds for your character and how to make speech bubbles that show your character talking.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec36"><a id="page_53"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the theatre background. Then, start the cat’s script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">2. Tap the green blocks category to show the <em>sound blocks</em>
 in the palette. Tap the <strong>Microphone</strong>
 button to go into the ScratchJr recording studio.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Here you can tap the <strong>Record</strong>
 button to record a sound, tap the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button to stop recording, and tap the <strong>Play</strong>
 button to play the sound you recorded.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The green sound bars show you how loud the sounds are while you’re recording them. More green bars mean a louder sound recording.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_54"></a>
 4. When you are happy with your sound, tap the check mark to save it. Your sound will be saved as a new Play Recorded Sound block that you can add to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. You can also have your characters talk with speech bubbles. Tap the purple blocks category to reveal the looks blocks in the palette. Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area and snap it onto the end of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the white box under the speech bubble and delete the text there by tapping the backspace key. Now type what you want the cat to say and tap <strong>Go</strong>
 . If you type a longer speech for your character to say, the speech bubble will appear on the stage for longer so that you have time to read it all.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_55"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re ready, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to see the show!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec37">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Before you have saved your recording, you can play it back to hear it. If you don’t like it, simply press the Record button again to record another sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Play Recorded Sound blocks appear in the green palette only after you have recorded a sound and saved it. You can keep up to five sounds for each character on each page of a project. (You’ll learn how to add multiple pages in “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_58">page 58</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_56"></a>
 If you want to delete a sound, press and hold (<em>long-press</em>
 ) the Play Recorded Sound block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You will see a red X appear. Tap the X to delete the sound.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec38">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you make sounds and speech bubbles play at the same time? Make two scripts for the same character. Put both scripts in the character’s programming area and begin both scripts with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, but don’t connect them together!</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: one script should have only Play Recorded Sound blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_57"><a id="page_57" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb17">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec20"><a id="page_58"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec42">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Does your story have a title? Let’s add one to the stage! Tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top and type the title of your tale.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can change the size of your title by tapping the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button, which looks like three A’s. You can also change the color of your title by tapping the <strong>Change Color</strong>
 button, which looks like a paint bucket. Try it!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_65"></a>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb22">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button. If you are on a different page when you tap the Green Flag button, the action will start on that page and continue to the end, without going through the first part of your story.</p>

<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 have the cat build the bottom snowball, on <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 have the cat add the middle snowball, and on <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 have the cat put on the snowman’s head and arms.</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one.

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The green sound bars show you how loud the sounds are while you’re recording them. More green bars mean a louder sound recording.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_54"></a>
 4. When you are happy with your sound, tap the check mark to save it. Your sound will be saved as a new Play Recorded Sound block that you can add to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. You can also have your characters talk with speech bubbles. Tap the purple blocks category to reveal the looks blocks in the palette. Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area and snap it onto the end of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the white box under the speech bubble and delete the text there by tapping the backspace key. Now type what you want the cat to say and tap <strong>Go</strong>
 . If you type a longer speech for your character to say, the speech bubble will appear on the stage for longer so that you have time to read it all.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>

<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>

 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

<p class="noindent">As you are using the paint editor, you may need extra help finding the tool that you want. Don’t be afraid to ask your classmates or an adult!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb33">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE CIRCLES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the circles as you add them to the snowman to make sure that the three circles of the body plus the two circles of the eyes make five circles.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb34">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one. Try selecting a more visible color just to show them how the Fill tool works. Then go back to white and fill the circles for the snowman.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="order">2. Tap the green blocks category to show the <em>sound blocks</em>
 in the palette. Tap the <strong>Microphone</strong>
 button to go into the ScratchJr recording studio.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Here you can tap the <strong>Record</strong>
 button to record a sound, tap the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button to stop recording, and tap the <strong>Play</strong>
 button to play the sound you recorded.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The green sound bars show you how loud the sounds are while you’re recording them. More green bars mean a louder sound recording.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_54"></a>
 4. When you are happy with your sound, tap the check mark to save it. Your sound will be saved as a new Play Recorded Sound block that you can add to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. You can also have your characters talk with speech bubbles. Tap the purple blocks category to reveal the looks blocks in the palette. Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area and snap it onto the end of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the white box under the speech bubble and delete the text there by tapping the backspace key. Now type what you want the cat to say and tap <strong>Go</strong>
 . If you type a longer speech for your character to say, the speech bubble will appear on the stage for longer so that you have time to read it all.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_55"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re ready, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to see the show!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec37">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Before you have saved your recording, you can play it back to hear it. If you don’t like it, simply press the Record button again to record another sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Play Recorded Sound blocks appear in the green palette only after you have recorded a sound and saved it. You can keep up to five sounds for each character on each page of a project. (You’ll learn how to add multiple pages in “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec38">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you make sounds and speech bubbles play at the same time? Make two scripts for the same character. Put both scripts in the character’s programming area and begin both scripts with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, but don’t connect them together!</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: one script should have only Play Recorded Sound blocks.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec20"><a id="page_58"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb23">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

 to <a style=";color:black;" href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Here you can tap the <strong>Record</strong>
 button to record a sound, tap the <strong>Stop</strong>
 button to stop recording, and tap the <strong>Play</strong>
 button to play the sound you recorded.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The green sound bars show you how loud the sounds are while you’re recording them. More green bars mean a louder sound recording.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_54"></a>
 4. When you are happy with your sound, tap the check mark to save it. Your sound will be saved as a new Play Recorded Sound block that you can add to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. You can also have your characters talk with speech bubbles. Tap the purple blocks category to reveal the looks blocks in the palette. Drag the <strong>Say</strong>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons.

<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>

 4. When you are happy with your sound, tap the check mark to save it. Your sound will be saved as a new Play Recorded Sound block that you can add to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. You can also have your characters talk with speech bubbles. Tap the purple blocks category to reveal the looks blocks in the palette. Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area and snap it onto the end of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the white box under the speech bubble and delete the text there by tapping the backspace key. Now type what you want the cat to say and tap <strong>Go</strong>
 . If you type a longer speech for your character to say, the speech bubble will appear on the stage for longer so that you have time to read it all.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_55"></a>

</h4>
<p class="noindent">Before you have saved your recording, you can play it back to hear it. If you don’t like it, simply press the Record button again to record another sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Play Recorded Sound blocks appear in the green palette only after you have recorded a sound and saved it. You can keep up to five sounds for each character on each page of a project. (You’ll learn how to add multiple pages in “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>

 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>

 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>

<p class="order"><a id="page_54"></a>
 4. When you are happy with your sound, tap the check mark to save it. Your sound will be saved as a new Play Recorded Sound block that you can add to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. You can also have your characters talk with speech bubbles. Tap the purple blocks category to reveal the looks blocks in the palette. Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area and snap it onto the end of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the white box under the speech bubble and delete the text there by tapping the backspace key. Now type what you want the cat to say and tap <strong>Go</strong>
 . If you type a longer speech for your character to say, the speech bubble will appear on the stage for longer so that you have time to read it all.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_55"></a>

<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Before you have saved your recording, you can play it back to hear it. If you don’t like it, simply press the Record button again to record another sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Play Recorded Sound blocks appear in the green palette only after you have recorded a sound and saved it. You can keep up to five sounds for each character on each page of a project. (You’ll learn how to add multiple pages in “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>

 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>

 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

</p>
<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one.

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the white box under the speech bubble and delete the text there by tapping the backspace key. Now type what you want the cat to say and tap <strong>Go</strong>
 . If you type a longer speech for your character to say, the speech bubble will appear on the stage for longer so that you have time to read it all.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_55"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">7. When you’re ready, tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to see the show!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec37">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Before you have saved your recording, you can play it back to hear it. If you don’t like it, simply press the Record button again to record another sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Play Recorded Sound blocks appear in the green palette only after you have recorded a sound and saved it. You can keep up to five sounds for each character on each page of a project. (You’ll learn how to add multiple pages in “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>
 ” on <a href="text00009.html#page_58">page 58</a>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_56"></a>
 If you want to delete a sound, press and hold (<em>long-press</em>
 ) the Play Recorded Sound block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You will see a red X appear. Tap the X to delete the sound.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec38">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you make sounds and speech bubbles play at the same time? Make two scripts for the same character. Put both scripts in the character’s programming area and begin both scripts with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, but don’t connect them together!</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: one script should have only Play Recorded Sound blocks.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec20"><a id="page_58"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec42">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb23">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

<p class="noindent">Before you have saved your recording, you can play it back to hear it. If you don’t like it, simply press the Record button again to record another sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Play Recorded Sound blocks appear in the green palette only after you have recorded a sound and saved it. You can keep up to five sounds for each character on each page of a project. (You’ll learn how to add multiple pages in “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>

<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<p class="noindent">Before you have saved your recording, you can play it back to hear it. If you don’t like it, simply press the Record button again to record another sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Play Recorded Sound blocks appear in the green palette only after you have recorded a sound and saved it. You can keep up to five sounds for each character on each page of a project. (You’ll learn how to add multiple pages in “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>

 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec37">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Before you have saved your recording, you can play it back to hear it. If you don’t like it, simply press the Record button again to record another sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Play Recorded Sound blocks appear in the green palette only after you have recorded a sound and saved it. You can keep up to five sounds for each character on each page of a project. (You’ll learn how to add multiple pages in “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec38">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you make sounds and speech bubbles play at the same time? Make two scripts for the same character. Put both scripts in the character’s programming area and begin both scripts with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, but don’t connect them together!</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: one script should have only Play Recorded Sound blocks.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>

<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>

 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Before you have saved your recording, you can play it back to hear it. If you don’t like it, simply press the Record button again to record another sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Play Recorded Sound blocks appear in the green palette only after you have recorded a sound and saved it. You can keep up to five sounds for each character on each page of a project. (You’ll learn how to add multiple pages in “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>

Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Play Recorded Sound blocks appear in the green palette only after you have recorded a sound and saved it. You can keep up to five sounds for each character on each page of a project. (You’ll learn how to add multiple pages in “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec38">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you make sounds and speech bubbles play at the same time? Make two scripts for the same character. Put both scripts in the character’s programming area and begin both scripts with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, but don’t connect them together!</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: one script should have only Play Recorded Sound blocks.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>

<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>

<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec38">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you make sounds and speech bubbles play at the same time? Make two scripts for the same character. Put both scripts in the character’s programming area and begin both scripts with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, but don’t connect them together!</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: one script should have only Play Recorded Sound blocks.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec42">

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb22">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button. If you are on a different page when you tap the Green Flag button, the action will start on that page and continue to the end, without going through the first part of your story.</p>

<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 have the cat build the bottom snowball, on <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 have the cat add the middle snowball, and on <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 have the cat put on the snowman’s head and arms.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ASKING QUESTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As you are using the paint editor, you may need extra help finding the tool that you want. Don’t be afraid to ask your classmates or an adult!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb33">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE CIRCLES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the circles as you add them to the snowman to make sure that the three circles of the body plus the two circles of the eyes make five circles.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb34">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one. Try selecting a more visible color just to show them how the Fill tool works. Then go back to white and fill the circles for the snowman.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a style=";color:black;" href="text00013.html#app02">Appendix B</a>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_96"><a id="page_96" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec38">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you make sounds and speech bubbles play at the same time? Make two scripts for the same character. Put both scripts in the character’s programming area and begin both scripts with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, but don’t connect them together!</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: one script should have only Play Recorded Sound blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_57"><a id="page_57" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb17">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec20"><a id="page_58"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec42">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Does your story have a title? Let’s add one to the stage! Tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top and type the title of your tale.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can change the size of your title by tapping the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button, which looks like three A’s. You can also change the color of your title by tapping the <strong>Change Color</strong>
 button, which looks like a paint bucket. Try it!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_65"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can move the text around the page by dragging it, just like you can with a character. You could even write something on the whiteboard in the classroom!</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING YOUR OWN STORIES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use ScratchJr to tell a story that actually happened to you! Use multiple pages to make sure your story has a beginning, middle, and end. Try including more pictures and words to tell your story. Don’t forget to share it with a friend when you’re all done!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb21">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEQUENCING YOUR STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make new pages and put them in order. Practice counting forward each time your story moves to the next page. How many pages does your story have? Are your pages in the correct order?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb22">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button. If you are on a different page when you tap the Green Flag button, the action will start on that page and continue to the end, without going through the first part of your story.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 have the cat build the bottom snowball, on <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 have the cat add the middle snowball, and on <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 have the cat put on the snowman’s head and arms.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">Can you make sounds and speech bubbles play at the same time? Make two scripts for the same character. Put both scripts in the character’s programming area and begin both scripts with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, but don’t connect them together!</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: one script should have only Play Recorded Sound blocks.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>

<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>

<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb17">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec42">

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb22">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 have the cat build the bottom snowball, on <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 have the cat add the middle snowball, and on <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 have the cat put on the snowman’s head and arms.</p>

<p class="noindent">As you are using the paint editor, you may need extra help finding the tool that you want. Don’t be afraid to ask your classmates or an adult!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb33">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE CIRCLES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the circles as you add them to the snowman to make sure that the three circles of the body plus the two circles of the eyes make five circles.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb34">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one. Try selecting a more visible color just to show them how the Fill tool works. Then go back to white and fill the circles for the snowman.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb17">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: PRESENTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use a combination of speaking, singing, and typing words to complete your performing cat’s script. Practice speaking clearly when you record sounds so that other people can understand the story you have created.</p>
<p class="indent">You can always re-record your sounds until they are clear. Use the best sound recording you can make for your script. When you are finished, see if you can talk about your scripts with a friend or two and answer their questions.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb18">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: ADDING AND SUBTRACTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that your cat is singing in the performance, try making it dance too! Use the blue motion blocks to control your cat’s dance moves. Count how many times you make your cat hop, move right, and move left in the dance. What is the total number of dance moves in your script? If you take away all of the Hop blocks, how many dance moves are there now?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb19">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure that your device allows recording through a microphone and that the volume is turned up when you play the sound.</p>
<p class="indent">Troubleshooting iPads: when you first downloaded ScratchJr, it asked permission to use your microphone and camera. If you answered “no” to that question but want to use the microphone now, go to Settings on your device, find ScratchJr in your list of apps, and allow ScratchJr to access the microphone and camera.</p>
<p class="indent">Sounds cannot be copied to different characters. Each recorded sound is saved to a specific character (in a specific page and project) and can be used only in that character’s scripts. Make sure children know which character’s sounds they are creating.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec20"><a id="page_58"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec42">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Does your story have a title? Let’s add one to the stage! Tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top and type the title of your tale.</p>

<p class="indent">You can change the size of your title by tapping the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button, which looks like three A’s. You can also change the color of your title by tapping the <strong>Change Color</strong>
 button, which looks like a paint bucket. Try it!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_65"></a>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 7: TURN THE PAGE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>

<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

<p class="noindent">Let’s make a story about your school! So far, all of the action in your story has happened in one place. In this activity, you will see how you can set different backgrounds for different scenes in your story, like turning pages in a book.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>

<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

<p class="indent">You can show a character traveling through your school by making a new page in ScratchJr for each part of your school that your character will visit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec39">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>

<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

</p>
<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one.

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to create multiple pages in ScratchJr. After you create the new pages and add backgrounds and characters to them, you’ll learn how to use the Go to Page block to tell your story from beginning to end without stopping.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec40">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING YOUR OWN STORIES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use ScratchJr to tell a story that actually happened to you! Use multiple pages to make sure your story has a beginning, middle, and end. Try including more pictures and words to tell your story. Don’t forget to share it with a friend when you’re all done!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb21">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEQUENCING YOUR STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make new pages and put them in order. Practice counting forward each time your story moves to the next page. How many pages does your story have? Are your pages in the correct order?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb22">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb22">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button. If you are on a different page when you tap the Green Flag button, the action will start on that page and continue to the end, without going through the first part of your story.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

<p class="noindent">Count the circles as you add them to the snowman to make sure that the three circles of the body plus the two circles of the eyes make five circles.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb34">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one. Try selecting a more visible color just to show them how the Fill tool works. Then go back to white and fill the circles for the snowman.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">In this example, we will use three different rooms from a school: a classroom, a gym, and one more room that you can choose.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec42">

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb21">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEQUENCING YOUR STORY</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb22">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button. If you are on a different page when you tap the Green Flag button, the action will start on that page and continue to the end, without going through the first part of your story.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

</p>
<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one.

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>

<p class="order"><a id="page_59"></a>
 1. Start by selecting the classroom background, and pick a character to tell the story.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one.

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<p class="order">2. Cats are not allowed at school, so press and hold the cat character on the left, and then tap the red X to delete the cat.</p>
<p class="order">3. Give your character something to do in this scene. For now, we will just have her move across the classroom when we tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. When you are ready to add a new page, tap the plus sign on the right side of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>

 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>

<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>

<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>

<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>

<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>

 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

<p class="orderi">Now you have a whole new space to add the next part of your story!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>

 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>

<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>

<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE CIRCLES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the circles as you add them to the snowman to make sure that the three circles of the body plus the two circles of the eyes make five circles.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb34">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one. Try selecting a more visible color just to show them how the Fill tool works. Then go back to white and fill the circles for the snowman.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><a id="page_60"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec42">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Does your story have a title? Let’s add one to the stage! Tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top and type the title of your tale.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can change the size of your title by tapping the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button, which looks like three A’s. You can also change the color of your title by tapping the <strong>Change Color</strong>
 button, which looks like a paint bucket. Try it!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_65"></a>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING YOUR OWN STORIES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use ScratchJr to tell a story that actually happened to you! Use multiple pages to make sure your story has a beginning, middle, and end. Try including more pictures and words to tell your story. Don’t forget to share it with a friend when you’re all done!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb21">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEQUENCING YOUR STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make new pages and put them in order. Practice counting forward each time your story moves to the next page. How many pages does your story have? Are your pages in the correct order?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb22">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button. If you are on a different page when you tap the Green Flag button, the action will start on that page and continue to the end, without going through the first part of your story.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb29">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one.

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="orderi">It looks like you have started a whole new project, but you can see that your classroom scene is in the list of pages on the right side of the screen. You have only turned the page.</p>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="order">5. Pick a background for <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . This time, let’s choose the gym.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>

<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>

</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>

<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_61"></a>
 6. We want the same character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to be on this page, so add the girl as you did before and delete the cat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec42">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Does your story have a title? Let’s add one to the stage! Tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top and type the title of your tale.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can change the size of your title by tapping the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button, which looks like three A’s. You can also change the color of your title by tapping the <strong>Change Color</strong>
 button, which looks like a paint bucket. Try it!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_65"></a>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb20">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING YOUR OWN STORIES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use ScratchJr to tell a story that actually happened to you! Use multiple pages to make sure your story has a beginning, middle, and end. Try including more pictures and words to tell your story. Don’t forget to share it with a friend when you’re all done!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb21">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEQUENCING YOUR STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make new pages and put them in order. Practice counting forward each time your story moves to the next page. How many pages does your story have? Are your pages in the correct order?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb22">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button. If you are on a different page when you tap the Green Flag button, the action will start on that page and continue to the end, without going through the first part of your story.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec21"><a id="page_67"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_71"><a id="page_71" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb23">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>
 ” on <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#page_58">page 58</a>

 to <a style=";color:black;" href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. In the gym, let’s have the girl say “Time to exercise!” and jump up and down a few times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec42">

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb21">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEQUENCING YOUR STORY</strong>

<p class="noindent">Make new pages and put them in order. Practice counting forward each time your story moves to the next page. How many pages does your story have? Are your pages in the correct order?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb22">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button. If you are on a different page when you tap the Green Flag button, the action will start on that page and continue to the end, without going through the first part of your story.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>

<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">8. Now add a third page with a background that looks like another room in your school. We’ve chosen the library. Add the girl, delete the cat, and decide on an action that your character should take.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_62"></a>
</div>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one.

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="orderi">In our example, the girl walks over to a stool, climbs onto it, and says “I can stand on this stool to reach the books!”</p>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb29">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="order">9. When all of your pages are complete, it is time to connect them so that the action flows from one page to the next. Tap the first page in the list to go back to it.</p>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>
</strong>
 block at the end of your character’s script on the first page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb23">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

 to <a style=";color:black;" href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_76"><a id="page_76" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="ordera">10. Now tap the red blocks category to reveal the <em>end blocks</em>
 . Each new page you create makes a new Go to Page block with a small picture of your new page (called a <em>thumbnail</em>
 ) in it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera"><a id="page_63"></a>
 11. Use the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">Page 2</a>

<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>

<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">When this script finishes, it will “turn the page” and go to the second page of your story.</p>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>
</strong>
 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec42">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Does your story have a title? Let’s add one to the stage! Tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top and type the title of your tale.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can change the size of your title by tapping the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button, which looks like three A’s. You can also change the color of your title by tapping the <strong>Change Color</strong>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING YOUR OWN STORIES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use ScratchJr to tell a story that actually happened to you! Use multiple pages to make sure your story has a beginning, middle, and end. Try including more pictures and words to tell your story. Don’t forget to share it with a friend when you’re all done!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb21">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEQUENCING YOUR STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make new pages and put them in order. Practice counting forward each time your story moves to the next page. How many pages does your story have? Are your pages in the correct order?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb22">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button. If you are on a different page when you tap the Green Flag button, the action will start on that page and continue to the end, without going through the first part of your story.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>

<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="ordera">12. Now tap the second page, and add the <strong>Go to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">Page 3</a>

 block to the end of the script there.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">13. Tap the first page to return to it. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the action will flow through the pages without stopping. Every time a new page starts, all of its scripts that begin with a Start on Green Flag block will run automatically.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>

<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky.

To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>

<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly.

<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec41">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>

 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">As you add characters and pages, ScratchJr will keep track of them for you on the screen. The characters appear on the left, and the pages appear on the right. You can delete a character or a page from these lists by pressing and holding it and then tapping the red X that appears. You can change the order of the pages in the list by dragging them before or after other pages.</p>
<p class="indent">You can copy a character and its scripts from one page to another by dragging the character from the character area to the page thumbnail.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_64"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can then change the script of the character on the new page, and it will not affect the script of that character on the original page.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>

</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>

 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>

 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb23">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<p class="indent">You can change the size of your title by tapping the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button, which looks like three A’s. You can also change the color of your title by tapping the <strong>Change Color</strong>
 button, which looks like a paint bucket. Try it!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_65"></a>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING YOUR OWN STORIES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use ScratchJr to tell a story that actually happened to you! Use multiple pages to make sure your story has a beginning, middle, and end. Try including more pictures and words to tell your story. Don’t forget to share it with a friend when you’re all done!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb21">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEQUENCING YOUR STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make new pages and put them in order. Practice counting forward each time your story moves to the next page. How many pages does your story have? Are your pages in the correct order?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb22">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If the action does not automatically continue after the script has turned to a new page, make sure your scripts have a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">To show your entire story from the start, make sure the first page is currently selected when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button. If you are on a different page when you tap the Green Flag button, the action will start on that page and continue to the end, without going through the first part of your story.</p>
</div>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb23">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

 to <a style=";color:black;" href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>

<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>

</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec21"><a id="page_67"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 8: CHANGE THE PACE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_71"><a id="page_71" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb23">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>
 ” on <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#page_58">page 58</a>
 if you need a reminder of how to move from <a style=";color:black;" href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a style=";color:black;" href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>
<div class="image"></div>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_76"><a id="page_76" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_80"><a id="page_80" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb29">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 have the cat build the bottom snowball, on <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 have the cat add the middle snowball, and on <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 have the cat put on the snowman’s head and arms.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ASKING QUESTIONS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As you are using the paint editor, you may need extra help finding the tool that you want. Don’t be afraid to ask your classmates or an adult!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb33">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE CIRCLES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the circles as you add them to the snowman to make sure that the three circles of the body plus the two circles of the eyes make five circles.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb34">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one. Try selecting a more visible color just to show them how the Fill tool works. Then go back to white and fill the circles for the snowman.</p>

<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<p class="noindent">Make two characters race each other! Who will win? You decide!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec43">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb23">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

 to <a style=";color:black;" href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>

<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the Set Speed block to tell each character how fast to move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec44">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>

 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

<p class="order">1. For this race, we’ll choose the savannah background.</p>
<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>

 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>

<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<p class="order">2. Delete the cat, and add the zebra and the monkey.</p>
<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

<p class="order">3. Let’s make a script for the zebra first. Begin your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block.</p>
<p class="order">4. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks. You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block to make characters go slowly or quickly.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_68"></a>
 When you tap the arrow at the bottom of the Set Speed block, it gives you three options: Slow, Medium, and Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">This changes the speed of any action block you put in the script after the Set Speed block.</p>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb23">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

 .</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>

<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="orderi">Your characters will all move at medium speed unless you use the Set Speed block to make them go slower or quicker.</p>
<p class="order">5. In this activity, we want the zebra to go slower . . .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order1">. . . and the monkey to go faster.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top and watch them race! Can you change the race to have a different winner? Can you make it a tie?</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging.

<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>

 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<div class="image"><a id="page_69"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one.

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

 .</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>

<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one.

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec45">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec46"><a id="page_70"></a>
 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons.

<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<p class="noindent">Since the scripts for the zebra and the monkey are so similar, we can take a shortcut. After making the zebra’s script, copy it to the monkey by dragging it from the zebra’s programming area over to the monkey in the character area on the left side of the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character.

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">Now choose the monkey and just change the speed in the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block in the script that you copied.</p>

 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

 <strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Remember that the Set Speed block affects all the action blocks that come after it.</p>

<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_71"><a id="page_71" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb23">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button at the top of the stage to create an announcement that the race is beginning! After the race is over, add a second page to your story and type an announcement about who won (monkey or zebra) at the top of that page.</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: go back to “<a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec20">Activity 7: Turn the Page!</a>
 ” on <a style=";color:black;" href="text00009.html#page_58">page 58</a>

 .</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb24">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TIMING THE RACE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 9: STOP AND LOOK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Help the cat cross the street safely by pausing first at the sidewalk!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_76"><a id="page_76" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>

 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have used the Set Speed block to make your characters race, try to see how else you can use it. Can you make a character shrink slowly or grow quickly? Can you make a character disappear in the blink of an eye or fade away slowly?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use more than one Set Speed block in one script. Can you make your character move slowly at first and then very fast? Or run really fast and then slow down? Try different combinations to see how your character can move.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one.

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent">Keep time! Count how many seconds it takes the monkey to complete the race and how many seconds it takes the zebra. Compare the numbers. Which number is larger? Which animal had the fastest time?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb25">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It can help to explain the different speeds as “Walk, Jog, and Run” instead of “Slow, Medium, and Fast.”</p>
<p class="indent">When you drag a script to another character to copy it over, you should see the script return to the programming area of the first character. If the script disappears entirely, then it’s possible that you did not actually reach the target character before letting go of the script that you were dragging. In that case, ScratchJr will think that you are deleting the script. If this happens, just tap the <strong>Undo</strong>
 button on the blocks palette, and the script should reappear.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72" style=";color:black;"></a>
 Note that when you set the speed of a character in a script, the character will keep moving at that speed until you set a new speed. For example, the first time you run the following script, the character will move down at normal speed and then move up quickly. But when you run the script a second time, the character will move down quickly and up quickly because it is still set to Fast.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">To avoid this, you can set speeds at the beginning or end of the script to reset the character to its initial speed.</p>

<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec47">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will use a Wait block to make the action pause for a few seconds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec48">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot.

 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 have the cat build the bottom snowball, on <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 have the cat add the middle snowball, and on <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 have the cat put on the snowman’s head and arms.</p>

</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>

<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_96"><a id="page_96" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="order">1. Select the suburbs background and position your cat at the top of the grass next to the house.</p>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb26">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="order">2. Start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, and then use the <strong>Move Down</strong>
 block to have the cat take two steps toward the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Make sure the cat isn’t already in the road! If two steps are too many, have the cat take one step instead.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_74"></a>
 3. Now, tap the orange blocks category to show the control blocks, and then drag the <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb29">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 have the cat build the bottom snowball, on <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 have the cat add the middle snowball, and on <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 have the cat put on the snowman’s head and arms.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. You can tap the number input at the bottom of the Wait block to change the amount of time you want the cat to wait. The number is given in tenths of a second. Let’s change the number to <strong>20</strong>
 so that the cat will wait 2 seconds before crossing the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. After waiting at the side of the street, the cat can safely cross, so have it move down another four steps to reach the other side of the street.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. When you run the script by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen, the script will pause when it reaches the Wait block, and then it will continue with the last block. This makes the cat move from the grass to the edge of the road, pause, and then cross the street.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_75"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec49">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to program a car that crosses the road in front of the cat. Time the car so that it goes along the road while the cat is waiting. Can you make the cat wait long enough so that it crosses safely after the car has passed?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>

<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 have the cat build the bottom snowball, on <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 have the cat add the middle snowball, and on <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 have the cat put on the snowman’s head and arms.</p>

</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>

 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: ADDING NARRATION</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">What does your cat want to say during different parts of the story? Use the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to add narration. Can’t think of what to make the cat say? Have it tell a silly story or a funny joke!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb27">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: CHANGING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Practice changing the numbers on the Wait block to make your cat wait for different amounts of time. What number should you enter to make your cat wait 2 seconds? How about 4 seconds?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb28">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">The number on the Wait block is measured in tenths of a second. So if the Wait block has a 50 on it, the character will wait 5 seconds. You can help your child understand this by counting seconds out loud.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>

<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons.

<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec23"><a id="page_77"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 10: WAIT YOUR TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb29">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>

<p class="noindent">You can use the Wait block to control how two characters interact with each other. In this activity, the horse agrees to give the cat a ride and they gallop off together!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec50">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>

 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">The Wait block can pause the action for a character long enough to let another character say or do something.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec51">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>

<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top.

<p class="order">1. First, choose the farm background, and then add the horse. You can leave the cat where it is, but you need to move the horse to the left edge of the stage, as in the pictures shown here. We want to arrange the cat and the horse so that they move together.</p>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one.

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>

<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>

 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top.

<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one. Try selecting a more visible color just to show them how the Fill tool works. Then go back to white and fill the circles for the snowman.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="order">2. Let’s make a script for the cat first. Use a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the cat say, “May I have a ride?”</p>
<p class="order">3. Add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block to have the cat wait for 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) while the horse answers and walks over to it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb29">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 have the cat build the bottom snowball, on <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 have the cat add the middle snowball, and on <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 have the cat put on the snowman’s head and arms.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 have the cat build the bottom snowball, on <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 have the cat add the middle snowball, and on <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 have the cat put on the snowman’s head and arms.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_96"><a id="page_96" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="order"><a id="page_78"></a>
 4. Then move the cat forward 6 steps with the horse.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Now tap the horse to make its script. First, add a <strong>Wait</strong>
 block set to 2 seconds (<strong>20</strong>
 tenths of a second) to give the cat time to ask for a ride. Then, add a <strong>Say</strong>
 block to have the horse reply, “Sure!” Then move the horse forward 11 steps.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now when you tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top, the cat and the horse will speak, and then the horse will give the cat a ride to the end of the field!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb29">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec52"><a id="page_79"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to build your scripts so that the cat and the horse move together at the same time. It may take a few tries to get the cat and horse positioned just right so that it looks like the cat is riding on the horse’s back when they move forward.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec53">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">After the horse says “Sure!” see if you can have the cat answer “Thanks!” You will have to add another <strong>Wait</strong>
 block for the horse so that it waits for the cat to respond before moving forward. Try to figure out how much time you need to add for this.</p>
<p class="indent">Can you also time it so that the cat gets off the horse and says “Thanks!” again when the ride is over?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: USING FULL SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make sure you use full sentences when making the characters speak to each other.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb30">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE WAIT TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 have the cat build the bottom snowball, on <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 have the cat add the middle snowball, and on <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 have the cat put on the snowman’s head and arms.</p>

 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to increase the time on a Wait block, count how much time you need and replace the number on the block with your new time.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb31">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec24"><a id="page_81"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>

<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Coordinating a conversation between two characters is tricky. It requires a lot of trial and error, and if you make any changes to the action or to the dialogue, you will need to adjust the numbers on your Wait blocks. To coordinate actions and speech more precisely and systematically, you can use the Start on Message and Send Message blocks. You will learn about these blocks in <a style=";color:black;" href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly. The last character you move or add in ScratchJr will be “on top” (in the foreground), and when the horse is on top, the animation will look a little nicer.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 have the cat build the bottom snowball, on <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 have the cat add the middle snowball, and on <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 have the cat put on the snowman’s head and arms.</p>

<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one.

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">One tip for making it look like the cat is sitting on the horse is to add the horse to the project last or to move it slightly.

 <strong>ACTIVITY 11: BUILD A SNOWMAN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>

<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

<p class="noindent">ScratchJr includes a powerful paint editor that you can use to draw and change characters and backgrounds. For example, you can build your own snowman to live in the arctic!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec54">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">

<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>

 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will learn how to use the paint editor to make your own characters! You can also change other characters and backgrounds using the paint editor. Whenever you see the paint editor button, it means you can edit that object or create your own object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec55"><a id="page_82"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>

<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="order">1. Start your project by choosing the arctic background.</p>
<p class="order">2. To draw a character, tap the plus sign on the left side of the screen as if you were going to add a new character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons.

<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>

<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Without actually selecting a character, tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to open the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_83"></a>
 4. Now, to make a snowman, you will need three circles of different sizes. To make a circle, tap the <strong>Circle</strong>
 tool.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">5. Next, drag your finger on the drawing grid (or <em>canvas</em>
 ) in a diagonal line, and you will see a circle appear. When you get the size and shape that you want for the snowman’s base, lift your finger off the grid. Make another circle for the snowman’s middle. Don’t worry about where it is on the grid, because you can move it.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_84"></a>
 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 have the cat build the bottom snowball, on <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 have the cat add the middle snowball, and on <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>

<p class="noindent">When filling in the circles of the snowman with white paint, children might find it difficult to tell the difference between a filled circle and an unfilled one.

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

 6. Tap the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool, and then drag the circle where you want it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">If you tap on the drawing instead of dragging it, little circles will appear on the lines that let you change the shape. We want our snowman to have round snowballs, so be careful not to drag one of these little circles, or you might accidentally change the round shape.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">7. Make a third circle for the snowman’s head and drag it into place too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_85"></a>
 8. Now you need to make the eyes with two much smaller circles. Using the Circle tool, draw a small circle, or just tap the screen to create a round dot. You can make sure your eye circles are the same size by using the Duplicate tool, which makes a copy of the shape you choose. Tap the <strong>Duplicate</strong>
 tool (which looks like a stamp), and then tap the eye circle that you want to copy.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">The Duplicate tool makes a copy of the shape that appears just to the side of the original, so you need to drag them apart carefully. Drag these eyes into place on the snowman’s head.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_86"></a>
 9. Tap the <strong>Line</strong>
 tool and draw two arms for the snowman. Next, we need to fill in the snowballs with white paint. Tap the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool (which looks like a paint bucket) and select white from the color palette. Then tap each snowball, and the shape will fill with the color that you chose. Select black and color the eyes.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="ordera">10. To make a carrot for the nose, change the color to orange and tap the <strong>Triangle</strong>
 tool. Drag your finger diagonally anywhere on the canvas until you have a carrot-shaped triangle. Then, using the <strong>Fill</strong>
 tool, paint the carrot orange.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_87"></a>
</div>
<p class="ordera">11. The Rotate tool turns items around, and you can use it to arrange the carrot like a nose. To do so, tap the <strong>Rotate</strong>
 tool, and then press and hold the carrot. Keep your finger on the screen and move it up or down or side to side to turn the carrot. Use the <strong>Drag</strong>
 tool to drag the carrot into place on the snowman’s face.</p>
<p class="indentt">Ta-da! You’ve created your own unique character! Don’t forget that you can give your snowman a name with the text bar at the top. You can also add more features to your snowman, such as a hat, a smile, or some buttons. Tap the check mark at the top right when you are satisfied with your snowman, and it will appear in your arctic scene.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_88"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can give your snowman and the cat a script to tell your winter story!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec56">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you tap a character before tapping the Paintbrush button, the paint editor will open with that character on the canvas instead of with a blank canvas. This allows you to edit existing characters with the paint editor. Your modified character is saved as a new character—it won’t replace the original character. So go ahead and make a blue cat or a pig with polka dots! Any new or modified characters that you make will be saved in your character menu so you can use them in all of your projects.</p>
<p class="indent">If you make a mistake with your character, you can use the Undo button at the top. If you want to delete something in particular, you can use the Cut tool (which looks like a pair of scissors).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_89"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">Just tap the Cut tool, and then tap what you want to delete. Make sure you tap a different button afterward to continue painting, or you’ll end up cutting everything out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec57">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See if you can figure out how to edit the arctic background.</p>
<p class="indent">Write a script to show the cat building a snowman by making a new page for each step of the snowman building. So on <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 have the cat build the bottom snowball, on <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks.

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">

<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec58">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

<p class="noindent">Now you can use all of the skills you’ve just learned to make a full story! This story is about a race between a patient tortoise and a boastful hare. To create the scene, you first have to make a tortoise with the paint editor. Then, you can use the Set Speed block to make the hare move faster than the tortoise and to help the tortoise win! You will also use what you learned about making characters talk to each other and about turning story pages.</p>

<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. Choose the farm background, delete the cat, and add the rabbit character.</p>
<p class="order">2. We don’t have a tortoise character already made, so we’ll use the paint editor to make one. Make sure you paint the tortoise quite big! It will look smaller when it appears in the scene than it does in the paint editor.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_92"></a>
</div>
<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec60">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try recording yourself telling the story by using multiple <strong>Play Recorded Sound</strong>
 blocks. Can you time the recorded sounds with the actions on the screen?</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb35">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: CREATING A DIGITAL BOOK</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When programming this story, you’ll use a combination of drawing, writing, and speaking to create an animated tale about the tortoise and the hare! Practice writing and spelling by using the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to make speech bubbles for the characters and the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to add titles. When your story is finished, read your digital storybook to a friend! Practice speaking clearly and loudly to describe what is happening as your scripts are running.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb36">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: MAKING CHARACTERS MOVE</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Use numbers, counting, and guesswork to control the way the characters move with the blue motion blocks. You will need to experiment with different numbers in the motion blocks to make your characters move the way you want. Can you make the same action happen using fewer blocks just by changing the numbers? If you want your characters to move to exact spots on the stage, try tapping the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button (at the top of the screen), and use the numbers on the grid as your guide!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb37">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It will likely take children many tries to create a complete narrative with multiple pages and dialogue. Allow them to focus on one aspect of the story at a time, and encourage testing and retesting of scripts along the way. This lets them quickly find and repair <em>bugs</em>
 , or things that happen differently than expected, in their scripts.</p>
<p class="indent">It is frustrating for anyone to lose unsaved work! Remember to save your work often by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button at the top of the screen. When you see the project in your project library, it is saved. Tap the project’s image again to reopen it and continue working.</p>

<p class="order">3. The race will go over the farm, past a river, and through an orchard. For this we need to make two new pages. Add the river background to the second page and then add the spring background to the third page.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Let’s add the tortoise and the hare to the two new pages too. Drag the rabbit character from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 to copy it over, and then drag the tortoise from <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 to <a href="text00006.html#page_2">page 2</a>
 . Don’t forget to copy the characters to <a href="text00006.html#page_3">page 3</a>
 too.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_93"></a>
 5. You can use the Add Text button to add words of different sizes and colors to your page. Larger words look more like a title, and smaller words might be the main part of your story that you can read aloud. Select <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 and tap the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to give your story a title.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">6. Now comes the action. On <a href="text00006.html#page_1">page 1</a>
 , the tortoise and the hare talk about the race they want to have.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_94"></a>
 7. We’ll start you off with the script to begin the race. Then, can you write the scripts to show what happens next in your story?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order2">Here are some tricks you may need:</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You don’t want your hare to look like it’s waiting if it gets to the end of the page first! You can use the <strong>Set Speed</strong>
 block (set to <strong>Fast</strong>
 ) and the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to make the hare run to the end of the page and disappear. Use this trick to keep characters off the page when you don’t need them! Make sure to reset the speed of your character if you want it to slow down once it reappears.</p>
<p class="bull-o">• You can record sounds to add excitement to your story!</p>
<p class="bull-o">• Fables like “<a href="text00009.html#ch03lev1sec25">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>
 ” usually have a <em>moral</em>
 at the end—a sentence explaining what the characters learned. You can use the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button to display a moral at the end of your story. Use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 button to adjust the size of the words to fit your page.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec59"><a id="page_95"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Remember, the Set Speed block does not slow down or speed up the timing of Wait blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">When you have more than one character, you need to add the Go to Page block to the script of only one of the characters to turn the page. But be careful about which script ends with the Go to Page block. Some scripts will finish sooner than others, and the page may turn before all the characters have finished their scripts. You want to add the Go to Page block to the script that takes the longest to finish.</p>

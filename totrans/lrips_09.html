They finally knew where they were,
where they were going, <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> how to get there. It was all right there on
paper.</p><p>“The places on this map have funny names,” said Laurie.
“<span class="emphasis"><em>Truncate</em></span>. What’s that?”</p><p>“To Truncate is to make something shorter by cutting off part of it. The town of
Truncate has very precise borders,” Xor said.</p><p>“Oh. So what’s <span class="emphasis"><em>Axiom</em></span>?” Laurie asked.</p><p>“An Axiom is a rule that you pretend is true even if you don’t know why it’s
true,” said Xor.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Surely. My cousin Nand taught me all about it. She’s a
Euclidosaurus.”</p><p>“You’re making stuff up again, Xor.”</p><p>“No, it’s just one of those things,” the lizard shrugged, turning
gray-green. “Either you believe in Axioms or you don’t.”</p><p>“Oh yeah? I bet you don’t know what a Furfnoodle is,” Laurie said.</p><p>“It’s a . . . I mean, um. I give up. What is it?”</p><p>“A Furfnoodle is a kind of bird,” she said. “With long, blue feathers! And
it loves eating little lizards.”</p><p>“Really?” Xor looked worried and checked the sky for blue feathers.</p><p>“No. But if I ever see a big, blue bird that loves to eat lizards, I’m going to
call it a Furfnoodle.”</p><p>“You really shouldn’t make up words like that,” said Xor.</p><p>“If you can make up words, so can I,” Laurie said.</p><p>“I was telling the truth, Laurie.”</p><p>“It’s even fun to say!” she said. “Furfnoodle.”</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“Furfnooooodle!” she sang.</p><p>“Look, it’s not safe—”</p><p>“Furfnoodle. Furfnoodlefurfnoodle. Furf. Nood. Ull!”</p><p>There was a <span class="emphasis"><em>bloop</em></span> sound, and a tiny mouse-looking creature appeared on
the path in front of them.</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Furfnoodle!</em></span>” it said in a tiny mouse voice. It ran around
them a few times, then zipped off into the weeds, still screaming. “<span class="emphasis"><em>Furfnoodle!
Furfnoodle!</em></span>”</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00027a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00027"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/068fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>“What on Earth was that?!” Laurie said.</p><p>“That,” said Xor, “was a baby Jargon.”</p><p>“Where did it come from? It just blooped out of the air.”</p><p>“You made it with . . . that word.”</p><p>“I <span class="emphasis"><em>made</em></span> it?”</p><p>“I tried to warn you,” Xor said. “Where did you think Jargon came
from?”</p><p>“What’s so special about Furf—that word?”</p><p>“It’s a name that only means something to you. That’s what a Jargon
<span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span>,” Xor said. “You made it. It’s yours.”</p><p>“But why?”</p><p>“No one knows,” he said. “It’s one of those Axiom things. You have to
be careful with names. They have a power all their own.”</p></div></body></html>

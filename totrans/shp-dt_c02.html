<p class="ChapterIntro">Networks, which we briefly encountered in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 1"><a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a></span>, play an increasingly large role in our lives; accordingly, network data plays an increasingly large role in data science. How do we measure the influence of a user on social media? Or judge the robustness of a computer network against hackers? Or identify people who bridge different social groups? These are all questions about the geometric structure of networks, and they are all examples of concepts we will explore in this chapter.</p>
<p>We’ll begin this chapter with a brief motivational section arguing why network data is an important topic in modern data science that greatly benefits from geometric reasoning. We’ll then introduce the basic concepts and definitions in network theory, which is rooted in the mathematical language of graph theory. The bulk of the chapter will be a guided tour of various quantities associated to networks and their vertices. We’ll conclude with a quick look at a few different types of random networks that have been studied extensively in the literature and are easy to generate in the language R.</p>
<h2 id="h1-503083c02-0001"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_24" title="24"/><a class="XrefDestination" id="MotivationsforNetworks"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-003"/>Introduction to Network Science</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Network science</em>, which studies entities through their relationships with each other, is an important interdisciplinary subject that has gained momentum in data science since the rise of social networks. As we saw in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 1"><a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a></span>, network data is “unstructured” in the usual sense of the term, but it is highly structured in other ways. Mathematically, networks are rooted in a subject called <em>graph theory</em>, which distills entities and relationships down to their abstract essence. Networks are geometrically rich, but their geometry is different from the usual Euclidean geometry of angles and straight lines. To extract insights from networks, we must leave the Euclidean world of spreadsheets and embrace a more exotic geometry where spheres look nothing like the round objects we’re used to seeing.</p>
<p>Let’s consider a social media example. Users on a platform such as Facebook form a network, and distance can be defined by the smallest number of friendships connecting two individuals. This notion of distance underpins several ways of measuring a user’s centrality in the network, which we can use to quantify “influencers” in various ways. For instance, we could count the number of friends directly connected to a Facebook user’s account, or we could count how many friends of friends exist. Someone may not have many immediate connections but may have a large number of friends who are well connected. In other words, a user may have a large sphere of influence even if their immediate circle of friends is small. The geometry of networks also allows us to detect outliers by measuring how improbable a user’s network is compared to others; this helps social media platforms automatically detect inauthentic accounts.</p>
<p>A fascinating application of network-based outlier detection arose in a recent state supreme court case on gerrymandering. A conspicuous map of congressional districts in Pennsylvania prior to 2018 was widely believed to be the result of a partisan gerrymander favoring Republicans, but the court was not convinced until a team of experts brought in network science. They showed that one can view a districting map as a network, and by computing a random walk in the space of map networks to statistically probe the geometry of these networks, they found that the Pennsylvania map was several standard deviations away from the mean. The new map under consideration at the time was right in the middle of the bell curve of maps. They concluded that the old map was highly unlikely to have arisen organically; it was so unusual that it must have been deliberately engineered by the mapmakers (who were beholden to current Republicans in office) to increase the number of seats Republicans would hold. In contrast, the new map was much more typical (and a fair representation). The court was convinced by this network analysis and threw out the old map in 2018 to adopt the new one.</p>
<p>Even in scenarios that do not outwardly appear to be about networks, there is sometimes a way of viewing data as network data—and doing so avails one of a rich set of tools that draw from the remarkable geometry of networks.</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on the geometry of networks and how it can be used to define a wide collection of metrics that quantify various aspects of the shape and structure of a network. In the next chapter, we’ll apply these <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_25" title="25"/>metrics to explore machine learning and other forms of data analysis on network data. Let’s officially begin our journey.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">A network conveys pairwise relationships between entities, which can be individuals, objects, items, and so on. The entities are represented by <em>vertices</em> (also called <em>nodes</em>), while a relationship between a pair of entities is represented by an <em>edge</em> connecting the corresponding pair of vertices. Here are a few examples of entities and relationships that have been studied as networks: phone calls and text messages between people, proteins that interact in a biological pathway, towns connected by roads, websites connected by page links, parts of the brain activated during the same task, connections between words or parts of speech in a language—and that’s just scratching the surface of popular examples.</p>
<p>When plotting networks, the vertices are depicted as dots that are sometimes decorated with symbols so we know which vertex is which; the edges are usually straight-line segments, although sometimes it is helpful (for instance, to avoid artificial edge crossings) to draw some edges instead as curved arcs. All that matters is the collection of vertices and the edges between them—not how long the edges are in the plot, the angles between them, or the locations of the vertices. In fact, as shown in <a href="#figure2-1" id="figureanchor2-1">Figure 2-1</a>, the same network can be drawn in rather different ways.</p>
<p>These have the same vertices and the same edges connecting the vertices, but the plotting of these relationships varies. However we visualize the relationships, their underlying structure does not change.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">A network is <em>directed </em>if the edges represent one-way relationships (meaning they point from one vertex, called the <em>source</em>, to the other vertex, called the <em>target</em>); otherwise, the edges represent mutual relationships, and the network is <em>undirected</em>. For instance, for phone conversations, we could create an undirected network with an edge between any two people who have talked to each other, or we could create a directed network with edges representing outgoing calls from the source person to the target person.</p>
<p>Concretely, suppose we have three work colleagues: Sadako, Pedro, and Georg. Sadako is the project lead and, as such, makes calls to Pedro and Georg. Pedro calls Georg regarding a question on the engineering side of the project, but Georg does not call Pedro or Sadako. Pedro does not call Sadako, as he has already received instructions when she calls him. <a href="#figure2-2" id="figureanchor2-2">Figure 2-2</a>(a) shows the undirected network for these colleagues, while <a href="#figure2-2">Figure 2-2</a>(b) shows the directed network.</p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure2-2">Figure 2-2</a>: A phone network among three colleagues that is (a) undirected and (b) directed</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Other examples of directed networks include travel routes, machine and social processes, needle sharing to trace epidemics, and biological process models. Mathematically speaking, the biggest difference between Facebook and Twitter is that Facebook is an undirected network (friendships are mutual), while Twitter is a directed network (users have both followers and accounts followed).</p>
<h3 id="h2-503083c02-0002"><a class="XrefDestination" id="NetworksinR"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-006"/>Networks in R</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">There are two main ways of representing a network in a computer. An <em>edge list </em>simply lists, in an arbitrary order, all the edges in the network by naming the two vertices of each edge (if the network is directed, then the first vertex is considered the source and the second vertex the target). A useful <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_27" title="27"/>package for working with network data in R is the igraph library (which also exists in Python with similar commands and syntax). To create the directed network in <a href="#figure2-2">Figure 2-2</a>(b) from an edge list, you can use the code in <a href="#listing2-1" id="listinganchor2-1">Listing 2-1</a>.</p>
<pre><code>library(igraph)
edges&lt;-rbind(c("Sadako","Pedro"),c("Sadako","Georg"),c("Pedro","Georg"))
g_colleagues&lt;-graph.edge(edges,directed=T)</code></pre>
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing2-1">Listing 2-1</a>: A script that generates the directed network in <a href="#figure2-2">Figure 2-2</a>(b) from an edge list</p>
<p>The other representation of a network is a spreadsheet. If a network has <em>n </em>vertices, its <em>adjacency matrix</em> is the <em>n</em>×<em>n</em> matrix whose rows and columns are indexed by the vertices where 0 in the (<em>i, j</em>) entry means there is no edge from vertex <em>i</em> to vertex <em>j</em>, while 1 in this entry means there is such an edge. If the network is undirected, then the adjacency matrix is symmetric (equal to its own transpose, meaning it is unchanged when swapping its rows with its columns) because, in that case, having an edge from vertex <em>i</em> to vertex <em>j</em> is the same as having an edge from vertex <em>j</em> to vertex <em>i</em>. <a href="#listing2-2" id="listinganchor2-2">Listing 2-2</a> provides the R code to construct the preceding directed network from an adjacency matrix rather than an edge list.</p>
<pre><code>library(igraph)
adjmat&lt;-matrix(c(0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0),nrow=3)
rownames(adjmat)&lt;-c("Sadako","Pedro","Georg")
colnames(adjmat)&lt;-c("Sadako","Pedro","Georg")
g_colleagues&lt;-graph_from_adjacency_matrix(adjmat,mode="directed",weighted=T)</code></pre>
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing2-2">Listing 2-2</a>: A script that generates the directed network in <a href="#figure2-2">Figure 2-2</a>(b) from an adjacency matrix</p>
<p>A major advantage of the adjacency matrix approach is that it puts networks into the framework of linear algebra, where many powerful tools are available. For instance, we can use the spectral theory (eigenvalues and eigenvectors) of the adjacency matrix to measure centrality in a network. Adjacency matrices also readily generalize to <em>weighted networks</em>; by allowing arbitrary numbers as the entries (not just the binary 0 and 1 entries discussed so far), we can assign a real-number weight to each edge that conveys the strength of the relationship represented by that edge. In practice, this can be used to represent many different important notions: volume of calls between colleagues in a phone network, distances between locations in a transportation network, and so on. You can think of an unweighted network as a weighted network in which all the edges have a weight equal to 1. In fact, this is why in <a href="#listing2-2">Listing 2-2</a> we set the <code>weighted</code> parameter to <code>T</code> (true) even though we wanted to create an unweighted network—otherwise, igraph interprets the adjacency matrix differently.</p>
<h3 id="h2-503083c02-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_28" title="28"/><a class="XrefDestination" id="PathsandDistanceinaNetwork"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-007"/>Paths and Distance in a Network</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Two vertices are said to be <em>neighbors</em> if they are connected by an edge. Two edges in a network are <em>adjacent </em>if they have a vertex in common. A <em>path</em> in a network is a sequence of adjacent edges. If the network is directed, then all the edges in a path must be compatibly oriented. For example, in <a href="#figure2-2">Figure 2-2</a>(b), we have a two-edge path from Sadako to Pedro to Georg and a one-edge path from Pedro to Georg, but going from Pedro to Sadako to Georg is not a path since the edges are not oriented this way.</p>
<p>The <em>length</em> of a path has two different meanings, depending on whether the network is weighted or unweighted. In an unweighted network, the length of a path is the number of edges in the path; in a weighted network, the length is the sum of the weights of the edges in the path. The <em>network distance</em> between two vertices is the length of the minimal-length path connecting them, assuming there is a path from one to the other (if there is no path, the network distance is undefined). People—us included—usually just say “shortest” path instead of “minimal-length” path, because it sounds more natural. This is somewhat misleading for weighted networks, as the minimal-length path is actually the path with the lowest weight, which may not be the shortest path in terms of the number of edges in the path. However, that’s a minor imperfection in terminology we can all live with if we’re careful.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s consider the weighted undirected network in <a href="#figure2-3" id="figureanchor2-3">Figure 2-3</a>, representing four towns and the length (in miles) of the roads between them.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" class="" src="image_fi/503083c02/f02003.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure2-3">Figure 2-3</a>: A plot of town connectivity and miles of road between connected towns</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The shortest path between V2 and V3 is the 8-mile path passing through V4, rather than the 12-mile road directly connecting these two towns. The network distance between V2 and V3 is therefore 8 miles rather than 12. Note that the physical lengths of the edges and paths in this plot <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_29" title="29"/>do not in any way represent the lengths as defined by the weights; in other words, Euclidean distance in a network plot has nothing to do with network distance! The placement of the vertices in a network plotted by igraph is chosen for aesthetic reasons (to minimize the number of edge crossings, for instance) rather than to reflect edge weights. This can be tricky to get used to at first but over time will start to feel natural. <a href="#listing2-3" id="listinganchor2-3">Listing 2-3</a> provides the R code to create and plot the network in this example.</p>
<pre><code>#create symmetric matrix of town connections and miles between each town
towns&lt;-matrix(c(0,0,0,4,0,0,12,2,0,12,0,6,4,2,6,0),nrow=4)

#label the rows and columns so the towns have names
rownames(towns)&lt;-c("V1","V2","V3","V4")
colnames(towns)&lt;-c("V1","V2","V3","V4")

#create a weighted undirected network from this adjacency matrix
library(igraph)
g_towns&lt;-graph_from_adjacency_matrix(towns,mode="undirected",weighted=T)

#plot town graph with edges labeled by weights
plot(g_towns,edge.label=E(g_towns)$weight,main="Plot of Connected Towns by Road Miles",vertex.color=2,vertex.size=20)</code></pre>
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing2-3">Listing 2-3</a>: A script that generates the network of connected towns from <a href="#figure2-3">Figure 2-3</a> and plots it</p>
<p>Network distances can play a major role in real-world problems. During the 2018 Ebola outbreak in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, limited physical routes between towns impacted epidemic spread, supply-chain logistics to move medical supplies and personnel, and population mixing between impacted towns and towns that didn’t have active cases at the time.</p>
<p>A word of caution about weighted networks: we tend to think of the vertices that are near each other (defined by network distance) as being the most closely related or the most strongly connected. This means that the smaller the weight of an edge, the stronger the relationship it represents. For this reason, you’ll often want to use reciprocals when setting the weights in a network. For instance, in a weighted phone network, rather than setting the weight between person A and person B to be the number of calls <em>c</em><sub>AB</sub> between them, you should set it to be the reciprocal 1/<em>c</em><sub>AB </sub>so that people who talk to each other more frequently will be closer to (rather than farther from) each other in the weighted network. In <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 3"><a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a></span>, we’ll revisit the town network from <a href="#figure2-3">Figure 2-3</a>, and we’ll reciprocate the weights so that they represent proximity rather than distance.</p>
<p>To start exploring the geometry established by network distance, we’ll turn now to some notions of centrality (which can also be thought of as importance or influence) in a network. Since we will rely on igraph throughout this chapter, we will no longer include <code>library(igraph)</code> in the code snippets; therefore, be sure to load this library before running any of the following code samples.</p>
<h2 id="h1-503083c02-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_30" title="30"/><a class="XrefDestination" id="CentralityofVerticesinaNetwork"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-008"/>Network Centrality Metrics</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Measuring the <em>centrality</em>, or importance, of each vertex in a network allows you to manually analyze the structure and functional behavior of networks. It is also frequently used for feature extraction, as centrality metrics provide numerical features that can be fed into traditional supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, as we’ll see in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 3"><a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a></span>. In other words, centrality metrics provide a way to equip network data with more conventional spreadsheet structure. There are many methods for quantifying vertex centrality, almost all of which involve notions from the preceding section—paths, network distance, and the adjacency matrix.</p>
<p>Centrality has many real-world applications. In epidemiology, individuals who are more central in contact tracing networks tend to spread disease to more people than less central individuals. Indeed, central individuals are typically connected to a wider range of people, and additionally central individuals often connect groups of people who otherwise would be unlikely to meet—thereby providing bridges between these groups across which disease can spread. In social media, central individuals are the “influencers” whose opinions are heard by many and spread widely. In marketing, central individuals can act as lucrative vectors for advertising campaigns. In criminology, identifying central individuals in drug distribution or organized crime networks allows law enforcement agencies to target their actions most effectively. In scientific research, centrality in citation networks helps reveal high-impact publications.</p>
<p>There are more centrality metrics than can be covered in this chapter, so we’ll focus on a handful of the popular ones that are implemented in the igraph library.</p>
<h3 id="h2-503083c02-0004"><a class="XrefDestination" id="TheDegreeofaVertex"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-009"/>The Degree of a Vertex</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">The most basic measure of centrality of a vertex is its <em>degree</em>, which by definition is the number of edges attached to the vertex. In a directed network, this can be broken down into two pieces: the <em>in-degree</em> counts the number of edges with this vertex as the target vertex, and the <em>out-degree </em>counts the number of edges with this vertex as the source vertex. In a Facebook network, your degree is your number of friends; in Twitter, your in-degree is your number of followers, and your out-degree is the number of accounts you follow. Going back to <a href="#figure2-3">Figure 2-3</a>, towns V2 and V3 each have degree 2, while V1 has degree 1 and V4 has degree 3.</p>
<p>In a weighted network, you can also measure the <em>strength </em>(also called the <em>weighted degree</em>) of a vertex, which is the sum of the weights of the edges attached to the vertex. In <a href="#figure2-3">Figure 2-3</a>, towns V1, V2, V3, and V4 have strengths 4, 14, 18, and 12, respectively. Since an unweighted network can be viewed as a weighted network in which all edges have weight 1, the vertex degree really is just a special case of strength.</p>
<p>Despite its simplicity, the degree of a vertex is a valuable metric. It is the one numerical quantity most social media platforms publicly list for each <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_31" title="31"/>account, and it is typically used to determine how much an influencer is paid in a marketing campaign to promote a product. However, it has impactful limitations. The degree of a vertex measures the size of that vertex’s immediate network of connections, but it does not capture the structure of this network nor does it look beyond these immediate connections. To illustrate why this matters, consider a Twitter user with 10,000 followers, each of whom has only a small number of followers; now compare this with a Twitter user who has only a few hundred followers, but some of these followers are highly influential users. While the first user has a higher degree, which user’s tweets are more likely to receive more retweets in the end? This example hints at how networks involve both breadth and depth, and degree is more focused on the former.</p>
<p>For another example of what degree does and does not capture, imagine two individuals in a contact tracing network. Suppose one user has more contacts (and hence a higher degree), but those contacts are mostly all connected to each other anyway, whereas the other individual has fewer contacts, but the contacts are spread across multiple communities that otherwise have almost no interaction. (We’ll see a concrete example of this situation later in this chapter.) Which individual poses a greater epidemiological risk during an outbreak?</p>
<p>These two limitations of degree—ignoring network depth and ignoring community-bridging properties—are two of the main reasons that we must push deeper into the geometry of networks. So, let’s take a brief march through the zoo of vertex centrality measures that go beyond degree.</p>
<h3 id="h2-503083c02-0005"><a class="XrefDestination" id="TheClosenessofaVertex"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-010"/>The Closeness of a Vertex</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">How does one determine whether a vertex is located near the center of a network or whether it’s near the periphery? The <em>closeness</em> of a vertex, defined as the reciprocal of the sum of network distances between this vertex and each other vertex in the network, is designed to capture this distinction. A vertex that is near the center of the network will have a relatively modest distance to the other vertices in the network, but a more peripheral vertex will have a modest distance to some vertices but a large distance to the vertices on the “opposite” side of the network. This means the sum of distances for a central vertex is smaller than the sum of distances for a peripheral vertex; reciprocating this sum flips this around so that the closeness score is greater for a central vertex than for a peripheral vertex.</p>
<p>In <a href="#figure2-3">Figure 2-3</a>, you might intuitively guess that V4 is the most central, V2 and V3 are moderately central, and V1 is the most peripheral. Indeed, if we ignore the edge weights and compute the closeness scores as an unweighted network, we get 0.20, 0.25, 0.25, and 0.33 for V1, V2, V3, and V4, respectively. For instance, the closeness of V2 is 1/(1 + 1 + 2). When using the edge weights, we get closeness scores of 0.05, 0.06, 0.04, and 0.08, so V4 is still the most central, but now V3 is the most peripheral; this is because the edge weights make V3 have a relatively large network distance from the other vertices.</p>
<h3 id="h2-503083c02-0006"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_32" title="32"/><a class="XrefDestination" id="TheBetweennessofaVertex"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-011"/>The Betweenness of a Vertex</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">The <em>betweenness</em> of a vertex measures centrality by computing how many paths in the network pass through the vertex; more precisely, it is the sum over all pairs of other vertices in the network of the fraction of shortest paths between the pair of vertices that pass through the vertex in question. When considering <a href="#figure2-3">Figure 2-3</a> as an unweighted network, the betweenness of V1 is 0 because no shortest paths between the remaining vertices pass through V1. The same is true of V2 and V3. The betweenness of V4, however, is 2 = 1 + 1 + 0, as there is one shortest path between V1 and V2 that passes through V4, there is one shortest path between V1 and V3 that passes through V4, and the shortest path between V2 and V3 does not pass through V4.</p>
<p>In <a href="#figure2-4" id="figureanchor2-4">Figure 2-4</a>, each vertex has a betweenness score of 0.5. For instance, for V1 the one-edge path between V2 and V4 does not pass through V1, the one-edge path between V3 and V4 does not pass through V1, and between V2 and V3 there are two shortest paths, one of which passes through V1, combining to give a betweenness score of 0 + 0 + 1/2.</p>

</figure>
<p>If you think of a network as encoding the ways that something (materials, information, disease, traffic, and so on) can travel between entities, then shortest paths are the most efficient travel routes. Betweenness centrality measures how disruptive removing a vertex would be to these routes. For example, in a shipping distribution network, the betweenness of a vertex indicates the number of shipping routes that would be impacted if a particular distribution center is shut down (not counting routes originating or terminating at that distribution center), weighted by the extent of this impact. In <a href="#figure2-3">Figure 2-3</a> (viewed as an unweighted network), removing V1 does not affect the shipping routes among the other cities (betweenness score of 0), but removing V4 completely takes away two shipping routes (betweenness score <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_33" title="33"/>of 2). In <a href="#figure2-4">Figure 2-4</a>, removing V1 impacts transportation between V2 and V3, but it takes out only half of the shipping routes between them (betweenness score of 0.5). Betweenness centrality’s use in estimating disruptive potential has found many practical applications; for instance, it identifies important servers to protect in a computer network (or which ones would be most effective to target in an adversarial attack!).</p>
<p>While closeness and betweenness measure rather different aspects of the centrality of a vertex, they are both based on shortest paths in the network. Shortest paths between points have a special name in geometry, <em>geodesics</em>, and we’ll return to them in much more generality in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapters 4">Chapters <a href="c04.xhtml">4</a></span>, <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_5">5</span>, and <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_6"><a href="c06.xhtml">6</a></span>.</p>
<p>All the remaining centrality measures that we’ll cover in this section are based on the adjacency matrix, and they can be thought of as variants of the famous PageRank algorithm that Google initially used (and still uses in some capacity) to rank search results by estimating importance in the directed network whose vertices are websites and whose edges are links. The math involved in these next centrality measures is heavier, but we’ll try to highlight the main ideas and big picture. Practically speaking, it is far more important to develop an intuition for what these centrality scores convey than to understand the details of their computation.</p>
<h3 id="h2-503083c02-0007"><a class="XrefDestination" id="EigenvectorCentrality"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-012"/>Eigenvector Centrality</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Adjacency matrix-based centrality measures aim to capture the basic idea that the importance of a vertex is determined by the importance of the vertices to which it is connected. This is where the notion of <em>network depth</em> alluded to earlier comes in. On social media, for instance, it isn’t just your number of followers that matters, it is the number of followers your followers have, the number of followers they have, and so on.</p>
<p>Let’s make this idea precise. Suppose we want to assign an importance score <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> to each vertex <em>i</em>. A simple model is to assume that the importance of each vertex is proportional to a weighted sum of the importances of the neighboring vertices:</p>
<p class="Equation"><span class="math"><span class="MEquation"><span class="MText">x</span></span><sub class="MathSubscript">i</sub><span class="MText"> = c</span><span class="Mnary">∑<sub class="MathSubscript"/><sup class="MathSuperscript"/><span class="MEquation"><span class="MEquation"><span class="MText">a</span></span><sub class="MathSubscript">ij</sub><span class="MEquation"><span class="MText">x</span></span><sub class="MathSubscript">j</sub></span></span></span></p>
<p class="BodyContinued">where the sum is over vertices <em>j</em> that are neighbors to vertex <em>i</em>, <em>a</em><sub><em>ij</em></sub> is the weight of the edge between vertex <em>i</em> and vertex <em>j</em>, and <em>c</em> is a constant of proportionality that we’ll assume is independent of <em>i</em>. This formula can be expressed as the matrix equation:</p>
<p class="Equation"><span class="math"><span class="MEquation"><span class="MText">x⃗</span></span><span class="MText"> = cA</span><span class="MEquation"><span class="MText">x⃗</span></span></span><span class="MathInline"/></p>
<p class="BodyContinued">where <b><i>A</i></b> is the adjacency matrix of the network. You might recall from linear algebra that this equation stipulates that the vector of vertex importances <em class="MText">x⃗</em> is an <em>eigenvector</em> for the adjacency matrix, and 1/<em>c</em> is the corresponding <em>eigenvalue</em>. When viewing a matrix as a linear transformation, the eigenvectors are the directions that get stretched but not rotated, and the eigenvalues measure how much these directions are stretched.</p>
<p>Matrices typically have many different eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and the eigenvalues need not be real numbers, so at first glance there could <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_34" title="34"/>be many different solutions to the preceding vertex assignment problem—some of which may involve complex values. Fortunately, however, if we disallow negative edge weights and importance scores, then something called the <em>Perron–Frobenius theorem </em>guarantees that we can find a unique real-valued solution to this vertex assignment problem. In other words, with this non-negativity condition there is always exactly one way of assigning importance scores to all the vertices in the network that satisfy all of our linear neighbor influence conditions. Well, almost: to get uniqueness, we need to normalize the importance scores (for instance, by scaling so that the largest importance score of any vertex in the network is 1). Doing this yields the <em>eigenvector centrality</em> scores for vertices.</p>
<p>In <a href="#figure2-3">Figure 2-3</a>, the eigenvector centrality scores (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth) for V1, V2, V3, and V4, when viewed as an unweighted network, are 0.46, 0.85, 0.85, and 1, respectively. This matches our intuition that V4 is the most central and V1 is the least central. When computed as a weighted network, using the edge weights shown in that figure, the scores are instead 0.16, 0.91, 1, and 0.59. So, in the weighted network, V1 is still the least central, but the most central is V3.</p>
<p>The main point of eigenvector centrality is that it is higher for vertices that neighbor vertices with higher eigenvector centrality scores. In social network terms, this means your importance is determined by the importance of your friends.</p>
<p>We can interpret eigenvector centrality more precisely by thinking in terms of random walks. Imagine you start at a random vertex and repeatedly take steps by choosing one of the edges attached to your current vertex at random. If the network is unweighted, then you choose these edges with equal probability, whereas if the network is weighted, then the probabilities for selecting the edges are proportional to the edge weights. The eigenvector centrality scores are proportional to the fraction of time you spend at each vertex when doing these random walks. For example, if the network represents the World Wide Web (where vertices are websites and edges are links), then eigenvector centrality conveys the amount of traffic each site gets if users just randomly click links.</p>
<p>One drawback with eigenvector centrality is that random walkers can never travel between two different parts of a network if there are no paths connecting the two parts. In other words, each random walker is constrained to the “island” (or, in more mathematical terms, <em>connected component</em>) it starts on. This is especially problematic for directed networks because edges can be traversed in only one direction: if the random walker reaches a dead end, it will remain stuck there forever. One way to help get our random walkers past islands and dead ends is to allow them to randomly jump to different locations in the network. That’s the main idea behind the next measure we’ll look at.</p>
<h3 id="h2-503083c02-0008"><a class="XrefDestination" id="PageRankCentrality"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-013"/>PageRank Centrality</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Google’s <em>PageRank centrality </em>is only a small modification of eigenvector centrality; it replaces the adjacency matrix with a scaled version before computing the eigenvector. The PageRank scores for V1, V2, V3, and V4 in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_35" title="35"/><a href="#figure2-3">Figure 2-3</a>, computed as an unweighted network, are 0.13, 0.25, 0.25, and 0.37, respectively.</p>
<p>The best way to understand PageRank is in terms of random walk probabilities. We play the same game as we did with eigenvector centrality, except now at each step there are two possibilities: the random walker either walks across one of the attached edges, as before, or jumps directly to a random vertex in the network. In the World Wide Web example, this means either people can click links or they can directly type URLs in their web browsers. This ability to jump helps the random walkers explore greater extents of the network, which helps boost the information captured by this centrality score compared to eigenvector centrality.</p>
<h3 id="h2-503083c02-0009"><a class="XrefDestination" id="KatzCentrality"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-014"/>Katz Centrality</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Another useful centrality measure that is also computed from the spectral theory of the network’s adjacency matrix is <em>Katz centrality</em> (sometimes called <em>Bonacich centrality</em> or <em>alpha centrality</em>), which is essentially a “higher-order” extension of the notion of degree. In an unweighted network, Katz centrality is a weighted sum of the number of vertices that can be reached by a path of length 1 (this coincides with the degree), the number of vertices that can be reached by a path of length 2, the number that can be reached by a path of length 3, and so on. The weights in this weighted sum are determined by the length of the path and by a user-specified “attenuation” parameter (called <em>alpha</em>) that ranges from 0 to 1. More precisely, paths of length <em>d </em>are given weight <span class="Symbol"><em>α</em></span><sup><em>d</em></sup>. This means that the farther away a vertex is, the less it contributes to the weighted sum.</p>
<p>For example, in social networks or social media, the biggest contributor to your Katz centrality is your number of friends, the next biggest contributors are the numbers of friends these friends have, and so on. In short, Katz centrality is a more sophisticated version of degree that looks deeper into your network’s overall connectivity. It turns out that eigenvector centrality is a limit of Katz centrality as the attenuation parameter approaches a certain value. Be careful when choosing the parameter alpha, though; you should always choose it to be less than the reciprocal of something called the <em>spectral radius</em> of the network (which we’ll cover in the “<span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Global Network Metrics">Global Network Metrics</span>” section); igraph won’t give you an error or even a warning message if you don’t do this—you’ll just get values that don’t make sense, such as negative scores for some vertices.</p>
<h3 id="h2-503083c02-0010"><a class="XrefDestination" id="HubandAuthority"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-015"/>Hub and Authority</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Another way to generalize eigenvector centrality is to provide each vertex with two separate importance scores rather than just one. The most popular incarnation of this is called <em>authority and hubness</em>. Conceptually, <em>authority centrality</em> measures how much knowledge of the network is stored within a vertex, while <em>hub centrality</em> measures how well a vertex knows where to find this knowledge (quick access to the information stored in nearby vertices). These two measures are interrelated: strong hubs tend to connect to strong authorities. Hubs usually have a high rate of connections among the vertices involved that allow for rapid information sharing.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">To better understand all these vertex centrality measures, it helps to consider a more interesting example of a network than what we’ve considered so far. The script in <a href="#listing2-4" id="listinganchor2-4">Listing 2-4</a> loads and then plots a network from a file that represents a social network of one of this book’s authors (Farrelly). You can find the dataset, along with the other files for the book, on the book’s web page: <a class="LinkURL" href="https://nostarch.com/shapeofdata">https://nostarch.com/shapeofdata</a>.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to develop an intuition for centrality measures is to plot them as the vertex size parameter. (More generally, using vertex size to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_37" title="37"/>illustrate any numerical property associated to the vertices of a network is an excellent visualization technique—it is a network version of bubble charts.) Since the range of the different centrality measures varies, in what follows we rescale each one so that the maximum value is 20, as this seems to give fairly readable plots. <a href="#listing2-5" id="listinganchor2-5">Listing 2-5</a> provides the R code we use to plot each one.</p>

<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing2-5">Listing 2-5</a>: A script that creates bubble chart network plots for each centrality measure on Farrelly’s social network dataset</p>
<p>Let’s start with closeness and betweenness, illustrated in <a href="#figure2-6" id="figureanchor2-6">Figure 2-6</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" class="" src="image_fi/503083c02/f02006_m.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure2-6">Figure 2-6</a>: Bubble charts of closeness centrality (left) and betweenness centrality (right) on Farrelly’s social network data</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_38" title="38"/>The closeness scores here appear to capture what we were hoping they would. Vertices that are located more centrally in the network are larger, and vertices that are more peripheral are smaller. Note that this notion of centrality is based on the global geometry of the network. For instance, V10 has the highest closeness centrality score because it is central to the network overall even though it is peripheral to each of the two main clusters (the medical school friends and the veteran friends).</p>
<p>Betweenness centrality (which, as you recall, aims to capture locations that when removed would be maximally disruptive to flow across the network) provides V7 and V10 with much larger scores than all the other vertices—and these are the two vertices that bridge the two main clusters in this network. There is also a more modest but still relatively large betweenness score for V14, indicating that many (but not all) shortest paths between the two main clusters pass through this vertex.</p>
<p>Next, let’s take a look at the eigenvector centrality and PageRank centrality scores shown in <a href="#figure2-7" id="figureanchor2-7">Figure 2-7</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" class="" src="image_fi/503083c02/f02007_m.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure2-7">Figure 2-7</a>: Bubble charts of eigenvector centrality (left) and PageRank centrality (right) on Farrelly’s social network data</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For both of these measures, V7 (representing Farrelly herself) has the highest value, and the values range across the medical school cluster in a way that—at least intuitively—does appear to capture a notion of centrality or importance. Perhaps the most striking thing about this figure is the contrast between these two closely related eigenvector-based measures. For eigenvector centrality, the values in the medical school cluster completely dwarf those of the veterans organization cluster, whereas PageRank centrality seems better able to reflect centrality and importance within each of the two clusters separately. The reason for this discrepancy is that random walks in which one simply chooses neighboring vertices to traverse with equal probability tend to meander around the highly interconnected <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_39" title="39"/>medical school cluster and have a low probability of taking the one edge (from V7 to V10) that leads out of that cluster. With PageRank centrality, the random walks include a fixed probability of jumping anywhere in the network, which helps them get to the veterans group cluster.</p>
<p>In <a href="#figure2-8" id="figureanchor2-8">Figure 2-8</a> we have Katz centrality, which as you recall is a higher-order version of degree that takes into account not just the number of neighbors but the number of neighbors of neighbors, and so on. We compute this for two different values of the attenuation parameter alpha by specifying the decay rate for the influence coming from higher-order connections.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" class="" src="image_fi/503083c02/f02008_m.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure2-8">Figure 2-8</a>: Bubble charts of Katz centrality for attenuation parameter alpha = 0.2 (left) and alpha = 0.1 (right) on Farrelly’s social network data</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It turns out the spectral radius for this network is about 4, so we need to choose values of alpha that are less than 0.25 (here, 0.2 and 0.1). We see here that both choices identified Farrelly’s V7 as the most central vertex, but for the higher of these two alpha parameters (left plot), the scores remain relatively high near V7 before dissipating rather quickly. With the smaller alpha (right plot), the dissipation is less sharp, and the Katz centrality scores are more evenly spread out across the entirety of the network. The plot on the left is more likely to capture what we typically think of as centrality or importance, and it is usually recommended to choose an alpha very close to the reciprocal of the spectral radius (and definitely not the default value of 1 in igraph).</p>
<p>Finally, let’s analyze authority and hubness. In an undirected network, these two measures coincide, so let’s first transform our network into a directed network. Since we don’t have a natural direction to the friendships in this social network, we’ll do this artificially as follows. For each edge in this network, say between vertex <em>i</em> and vertex <em>j</em>, with probability one out of three, we’ll convert it to a one-way edge from <em>i</em> to <em>j</em>, with probability one out of three, we’ll convert it to a one-way edge from <em>j</em> to <em>i</em>, and with probability <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_40" title="40"/>one out of three we’ll leave it as a two-way edge. <a href="#listing2-6" id="listinganchor2-6">Listing 2-6</a> shows the code to do this and then plot the resulting hub and authority scores.</p>
<pre><code>#randomly remove some entries in the adjacency matrix
mydata_directed&lt;-mydata
for (i in 1:20){
  for (j in i:20){
      rand&lt;-runif(1)

<figcaption><p><a id="figure2-9">Figure 2-9</a>: Bubble charts of hub centrality (left) and authority centrality (right) on a directed version of Farrelly’s social network</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are higher hub scores among the medical school individuals than the veterans group individuals due to the high level of interconnectivity of the former, with Farrelly’s vertex V7 serving as a prominent hub in this network. Many of the medical school individuals point to V5 and V3, giving these vertices large authority scores, while V7 has a relatively modest <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_41" title="41"/>authority score. This suggests that V3 and V5 are the primary sources of information within this community, and they pass this information along to V7, who shares it with the rest of the medical school individuals; in contrast, there is not much of a centralized structure or efficient flow of information among the veterans group’s individuals.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve explored all these centrality measures visually, let’s use a few of them to rank and compare the vertices in Farrelly’s social network (going back to the original undirected version). The code in <a href="#listing2-7" id="listinganchor2-7">Listing 2-7</a> can be added to that of <a href="#listing2-4">Listing 2-4</a> to produce a dataset of some centrality measures.</p>

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_42" title="42"/>By a considerable margin, betweenness identifies V7 and V10 as the most important vertices connecting the network. However, the other centrality scores for V10 are much more modest, suggesting it mainly functions as a bridge between communities rather than a true center of the network. This makes sense as V10 appears fairly undistinguished within the veterans group. It just happens to connect to Farrelly’s V7 and, hence, through her to the medical school community. Farrelly’s V7, on the other hand, has many neighbors (as indicated by degree) and is the top-ranked vertex for both hub score and PageRank—this is compatible with our conceptual understanding of this network as conveying two separate communities in which Farrelly is involved.</p>
<p>V3 is the second-highest ranked vertex in terms of degree and PageRank; this person appears to be at the social center of the medical school community. V5 has the second-highest hub score, indicating that it is close to the important members of the medical school community. Hub score (which coincides with authority here since this network is undirected) also distinguishes V12 from V20. Both of these are degree-one vertices in the periphery of the veterans group’s community and with low PageRank and zero betweenness. However, V12 has a higher hub score because it is near a highly interconnected little subcommunity.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Network geometry provides more than just centrality measures for vertices. In this section, we’ll introduce a few other quantities of interest associated to the vertices in a network. Examples include transitivity scores that capture how likely it is that your friends know each other, efficiency scores that capture how much traffic is diverted when vertices are removed, and curvature scores that capture distortions in the fabric of the network.</p>
<h3 id="h2-503083c02-0011"><a class="XrefDestination" id="TheDiversityofaVertex"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-018"/>The Diversity of a Vertex</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">While hub and authority centrality concern the potential flow of information through a directed network, another measure associated to the vertices in a weighted network concerns information in the sense of mathematical information theory. The <em>diversity</em> of a vertex is a scaled version of the Shannon entropy (a fractional measure of information content of a variable or set of variables) of the weight distribution of the edges attached to that vertex. As the name suggests, this captures the diversity of edge weights attached to each vertex. Entropy is maximal for a uniform distribution, so the diversity score is maximal (and scaled to 1) when all the edges have equal weights, and the diversity scores decrease from this value as the weights become more varied. One way to think about this is that a random walk on a weighted network (with probabilities proportional to the edge weights) will be least predictable at vertices with diversity scores closest to 1 and more predictable for vertices with smaller diversity scores.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">A useful notion in network theory is <em>triadic closure</em>, which is the tendency for triangles to form among triples of vertices that already have a pair of edges. In more down-to-earth terms, this is akin to asking whether two of your friends are likely to be friends with each other. Consider the network of friends depicted in <a href="#figure2-10" id="figureanchor2-10">Figure 2-10</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" class="" src="image_fi/503083c02/f02010.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure2-10">Figure 2-10</a>: A network of friendships with one friendship link unknown, illustrating the concept of triadic closure</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here, Justin and Jason are friends, as are Justin and Mick. The question is whether Jason and Mick are friends. This situation is called a <em>triangle</em> centered at Justin. If Jason and Mick are not friends, then it is called an <em>open </em>triangle, whereas if they are friends, then it is called a <em>closed </em>triangle. A network with mostly closed triangles suggests a high degree of cohesion. In social networks, this means individuals with a mutual friend are likely to know each other. On the other hand, a network with many open triangles may indicate a less cohesive situation but could also indicate missing data and incomplete information: people may not friend all of their real-world friends on social media, intelligence data may not contain all communication forms among a cell of terrorists, and so on. In any real-world setting, relationships may exist that simply haven’t been recorded yet.</p>
<p>One way to quantify triadic closure is through <em>transitivity</em>, which assigns to each vertex the fraction of triangles centered at it that are closed. In a social network, your transitivity is the probability that two of your friends are friends with each other. Let’s add the following to our collection of plots from <a href="#listing2-6">Listing 2-6</a>:</p>
<pre><code>#compute and plot transitivity for each vertex in Farrelly's social network
plot(g_social,vertex.size=20*transitivity(g_social,type="local",isolates="zero"),vertex.label.cex=0.8,vertex.color=2)</code></pre>
<p>Setting the parameter called <code>type</code> to <code>local</code> tells igraph to compute the transitivity around each vertex, and setting the parameter called <code>isolates</code> to <code>zero</code> forces the score for vertices of degree 1 to be 0 (which otherwise would be scored <code>NaN</code>, as a degree-1 vertex has no triangles centered at it). <a href="#figure2-11" id="figureanchor2-11">Figure 2-11</a> shows the resulting plot.</p>

<p>This shows from another perspective that the medical school community is more cohesive and more tightly interconnected than the veterans’ community. It’s likely that medical students involved in the same sort of extracurricular activities in the same classes know each other and communicate. Note, however, that Farrelly’s V7 has a relatively low transitivity score among the medical school individuals, meaning several of Farrelly’s medical school friends are not friends with each other despite the overall closeness of that group. (The transitivity of V7 is also dragged down by the fact that none of Farrelly’s medical school friends are friends with the veterans group’s friend V10.)</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Recall that two of the centrality measures we covered, closeness and betweenness, are defined in terms of the lengths of the shortest paths (or <em>geodesics</em>) in the network. Another interesting measure based on shortest paths, called <em>efficiency</em>, is defined for each vertex as follows: remove the vertex in question and then compute the resulting network distances between all pairs of neighbors of this vertex. Then, average the inverses of these distances. Removing the vertex is like creating a roadblock, and the neighbor-to-neighbor distances measure the length of the detours that must be taken because of the roadblock. Inverting these distances means bigger detours count toward smaller efficiencies, and vice versa. The efficiency measures how easily traffic can be diverted around each vertex in the network.</p>
<p>Efficiency is a useful way to probe the local geometry of the network. The word <em>local</em> here means we are exploring the network geometry nearby <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_45" title="45"/>around each vertex; this is in contrast to closeness and betweenness that are more global in nature since they involve paths across the entire network. Let’s add the computation of efficiency to <a href="#listing2-6">Listing 2-6</a>. We need an additional library to do this:</p>
<pre><code>#load the brainGraph library that adds on to igraph
library(brainGraph)

#compute efficiency for each vertex in Farrelly's social network
efficiency(g_social,type="local")</code></pre>
<p>We don’t show the bubble chart plot for this because it looks extremely similar to the transitivity plot in <a href="#figure2-11">Figure 2-11</a>. In fact, the correlation between the transitivity scores and the efficiency scores for this network is 0.96. In other networks, especially larger and more complex ones, this need not be the case. It is important to note that transitivity is an extremely local measure, as it considers only neighboring vertices and the edges among them. In contrast, efficiency is local in nature but can access larger pieces of the network because the detours caused by the roadblocks may extend beyond the set of immediate neighbors.</p>
<p>Another path-based vertex measure that—like closeness and betweenness—sees the global geometry of the network is <em>eccentricity</em>, which assigns to each vertex the largest network distance from that vertex to any other vertex in the network. This measures how peripheral each vertex is, so lower eccentricity scores generally indicate more central vertices. We’ll come back to this measure shortly.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Ricci curvature</em> is a concept in geometry that measures the distortion of straight lines on curved surfaces and the rate at which this distortion grows or shrinks. You can think of it as a force of sorts that warps straight lines into curved paths (like a small hand weight on a wet paper towel). See <a href="#figure2-12" id="figureanchor2-12">Figure 2-12</a> for a conceptual illustration of increasing Ricci curvature from left to right on the diagram.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure2-12">Figure 2-12</a>: A straight line with midpoint deformed by sliding it (from left to right) through spaces with increasing Ricci curvature</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_46" title="46"/>One of the adaptations of this concept from continuous geometry to the realm of networks is called <em>Forman–Ricci curvature</em>. The first step in calculating Forman–Ricci curvature is to assign a number to each edge in the network that measures how spread out the network is in the immediate vicinity of the edge. The number that is used is 2 minus the sum of the degrees of the two vertices attached to the edge; this is the negated number of edges adjacent to the edge in question. For example, in Farrelly’s social network (<a href="#figure2-5">Figure 2-5</a>), the edge between V7 and V10 has a Forman–Ricci curvature of –8 (coming from the six non-V10 neighbors of V7 and the two non-V7 neighbors of V10).</p>
<p>Next, we use these edge scores to assign scores to the vertices as follows: the Forman–Ricci curvature of a vertex is the sum of the Forman–Ricci curvatures of the edges attached to this vertex. Forman–Ricci curvature is almost always negative, so when visualizing it, we usually use its negation. In <a href="#listing2-8" id="listinganchor2-8">Listing 2-8</a> we compute the Forman–Ricci curvature for Farrelly’s social network and then plot it using its negation for the vertex size and edge thickness.</p>
<pre><code>#compute the degrees of all vertices

<p>As you can see, the areas of the network with more edges have a higher negated Forman–Ricci curvature. This occurs both in hublike regions where the network fans out (like in the medical school community here surrounding Farrelly’s V7) and in tightly interconnected regions (like the close-knit four-vertex subcommunity within the veterans group’s members).</p>
<p>In traditional geometry, curvature is used to study how substances flow across objects. Similarly, Forman–Ricci curvature can be used to study network flow patterns. We’ll turn to the concept of network flow in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 3"><a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a></span>.</p>
<h2 id="h1-503083c02-0006"><a class="XrefDestination" id="GlobalNetworkMetrics"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-022"/>Global Network Metrics</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">All the metrics discussed so far are <em>vertex metrics</em>, meaning they assign a score to each vertex in a network, quantifying some aspect of the vertex’s role or position within the network. For example, you could extract your network of Facebook friends and use these vertex metrics to measure how central each person is in it. However, sometimes instead of comparing vertices within a single network, we need to compare different networks. For example, you might want to compare your Facebook friend network to the Facebook friend network of someone else—or you could compare your friend network on Facebook to your friend network on a different social media platform. In this situation, we need metrics that assign a single number to an entire network; these are sometimes called <em>global network metrics</em>, or just <em>global metrics</em> if the network context is clear. Let’s walk through a few important ones.</p>
<h3 id="h2-503083c02-0015"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_48" title="48"/><a class="XrefDestination" id="TheDensityandTransitivityofaNetwork"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-023"/>The Interconnectivity of a Network</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">The simplest global metrics are the number of vertices in a network and the number of edges. Closely related to these (but often more useful) is the <em>density</em>, which is the number of edges in a network divided by the maximum number of edges possible on that vertex set. An undirected network with <em>n</em> vertices has at most</p>
<p class="Equation"><span class="GraphicInline"><img alt="c02eq001" src="image_fi/503083c02/c02eq001.png"/></span></p>
<p class="BodyContinued">edges (not allowing loops or multiple edges), while the maximum number for a directed network is twice this amount. Density gives a coarse measure of how interconnected a network is; it is computed in igraph with the <code>edge_density()</code> function. <a href="#figure2-14" id="figureanchor2-14">Figure 2-14</a> shows some networks with a range of densities.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" src="image_fi/503083c02/f02014_m.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure2-14">Figure 2-14</a>: The three networks in the top row all have a density of 25 percent, while the networks in the bottom left and bottom right have densities of 50 percent and 75 percent, respectively.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The average degree in a network can also be a useful global metric, but it contains precisely the same information as the density and is perfectly correlated with it. Indeed, the average degree is the sum of all vertex degrees divided by the number of vertices, and the sum of all vertex degrees is always twice the number of edges. Thus, average degree and edge density differ by a constant that depends only on the number of vertices in the network. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_49" title="49"/>Consequently, you can use one or the other measure, but nothing is gained by using both simultaneously.</p>
<p>The notion of transitivity discussed in the preceding section (quantifying triadic closure) has a global counterpart. When setting the type parameter to <code>global</code> in igraph’s <code>transitivity()</code> function, a single number is computed that gives the fraction of triangles in the network that are closed. This gives another way, different from edge density, to measure the overall interconnectedness of a network.</p>
<h3 id="h2-503083c02-0016"><a class="XrefDestination" id="TheEfficiency,Diameter,andRadiusofaNetwork"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-024"/>Spreading Processes on a Network</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Networks that are more spread out tend to behave differently than ones that are more compact. For example, consider three friends—Amara, Imani, and Taraji—sharing news with each other at a lunch table. We’d expect the girls to exchange information more easily together at a table than they would if they were in separate classes texting each other or talking as they passed each other in the hallway. Let’s take a look at a few different ways to quantify the spread of a network.</p>
<p>Setting the <code>type</code> parameter to <code>global</code> in igraph’s <code>efficiency()</code> function gives a global version of that metric that computes the average of the inverses of the network distances between all pairs of vertices in the network. No roadblocks are involved in this global variant of efficiency. Networks that are highly interconnected tend to have high global efficiency, as high interconnectivity means there are lots of direct routes between vertices, but, overall, it is best to think of global efficiency as a measure of the compactness of a network. The more spread out a network, the lower its global efficiency will be.</p>
<p>We can also compute the <em>diameter</em> of a network, which is the maximum eccentricity of the vertices in the network (and, hence, the “longest shortest path” between two vertices). The <em>radius</em> of a network is the minimum eccentricity, which measures how far the center of the network is from the most distant part of the network. In igraph, you can use the <code>eccentricity()</code> function first to score all the vertices and then use standard R commands to extract the maximum and minimum values from them. Both diameter and radius quantify some aspect of the spread of the data. One structure that can produce a large difference between the diameter and radius is a structure where there are several loose hubs connected to each other through a single bridging individual.</p>
<h3 id="h2-503083c02-0017"><a class="XrefDestination" id="SpectralMeasuresofaNetwork"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-025"/>Spectral Measures of a Network</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">We have seen that eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix and other matrices closely related to it play an important role in multiple vertex centrality metrics; the spectral theory (eigenvalues and eigenvectors) of the adjacency matrix also provides us with some useful global metrics. The <em>spectral radius</em> of a network (which came up earlier in our discussion of Katz centrality) is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. A variety of properties of the spectral radius have been established mathematically. In essence, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_50" title="50"/>spectral radius measures propagation across the network. It is inversely related to the robustness of the network when considering the spread of a harmful entity across the network, such as fake news or a virus. For instance, in an epidemiological model that we’ll discuss in the next chapter, a smaller spectral radius means disease spreading across the network will die out more quickly.</p>
<p>To compute the spectral radius of a network in R, you can use the <code>spectrum()</code> function in igraph that takes advantage of the sparse structure that adjacency matrices usually exhibit, or you can use any of the standard eigenvector or eigenvalue implementations in R, such as the <code>eigen()</code> function, on the network’s adjacency matrix.</p>
<p>Since igraph’s <code>spectrum()</code> function optionally returns all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix, it is easy to use it to compute other spectral measures—such as the <em>spectral gap</em>, which is the difference between the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix (the spectral radius) and the second largest eigenvalue. The spectral gap controls the convergence time of certain algorithms and random processes on the network, among other things. Other useful spectral measures are based on a variant of the adjacency matrix called the <em>graph Laplacian</em>, which is obtained by negating the adjacency matrix and adding the degree of each vertex to the corresponding diagonal matrix entry. The multiplicity of the 0 eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian is the number of connected components of the network. The smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian is called the <em>algebraic connectivity</em>; this is a connectivity measure of the network that conveys how difficult it is to fragment the network into smaller pieces. Farrelly’s social network has a relatively low algebraic connectivity because removing a single vertex splits the network into the veterans group and the medical school group.</p>
<p><a href="#listing2-9" id="listinganchor2-9">Listing 2-9</a> shows how to compute the graph Laplacian and extract from it the number of connected components and the algebraic connectivity.</p>
<pre><code>#compute the graph Laplacian of a network g
lap&lt;-laplacian_matrix(g)

#compute the eigenvalues and round to avoid numerical issues
evals&lt;-round(eigen(lap)$values,digits=5)

#compute number of connected components

<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing2-9">Listing 2-9</a>: A script that computes the graph Laplacian of a network <code>g</code> and then extracts from it the number of connected components and the algebraic connectivity</p>
<p>For example, running this code on the two networks shown in <a href="#figure2-15" id="figureanchor2-15">Figure 2-15</a> gives seven connected components each and an algebraic connectivity of 0.062 for the network on the left and 0.09 for the network on the right.</p>

<p>If you want to compare scores across networks of different sizes, it is better to use the normalized Laplacian; to do this, simply set <code>normalized=T</code> when computing the graph Laplacian in the first line of <a href="#listing2-9">Listing 2-9</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h1-503083c02-0007"><a class="XrefDestination" id="GlobalNetworkStructures"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-026"/>Network Models for Real-World Behavior</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">There are a few different types of networks that serve as important models for real-world behavior; these provide helpful baselines against which to compare real-world networks and data. Let’s start with the simplest kind to construct.</p>
<h3 id="h2-503083c02-0018"><a class="XrefDestination" id="Erdös–RenyiGraphs"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-027"/>Erdös–Renyi Graphs</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Erdös–Renyi graphs</em> are networks in which edges are generated randomly according to a uniform distribution on the set of vertex pairs. These are created in igraph with the <code>sample_gnp()</code> function. Both the networks in <a href="#figure2-15">Figure 2-15</a> were produced by using <code>sample_gnp(50,0.05)</code>, which creates a network with 50 vertices and an edge probability of 5 percent. The density of the graphs created this way will be close to the specified edge probability but not necessarily equal to it—just as repeatedly flipping a fair coin won’t always give exactly half heads and half tails. The networks in <a href="#figure2-14">Figure 2-14</a> were also created with <code>sample_gnp()</code>.</p>
<p>Erdös–Renyi graphs provide a useful null hypothesis. If you believe your network is highly structured, then its edges should be very far from uniformly distributed, so the network will not look or behave like an <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_52" title="52"/>Erdös–Renyi network. In the next two chapters, we’ll see how to practically implement this idea. Erdös–Renyi graphs do not appear often in nature, especially in socially driven settings. Real networks are almost always more structured than a network with purely random edges like this.</p>
<h3 id="h2-503083c02-0019"><a class="XrefDestination" id="Scale-FreeGraphs"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-028"/>Scale-Free Graphs</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">A <em>scale-free graph</em> is a network whose degree distribution asymptotically follows a power law, meaning there is a constant, <em>c,</em> such that the fraction of vertices of degree 2<em>d</em> is 1/2<sup><em>c</em></sup> times the fraction of vertices of degree <em>d </em>(at least approximately, with the approximation getting more accurate as <em>d</em> increases). The constant <em>c</em> (called the <em>power</em>) usually lies between 2 and 3. This power law property leads to the existence of many vertices whose degree is much higher than the average vertex degree in the network. Consequently, scale-free networks usually have a spoke-and-wheel shape of loosely connected hubs, like airport terminals connecting at a central security gate. The hubs in the network tend to rein in the distances between vertices, giving these networks certain “small-world” properties.</p>
<p>These networks have a fascinating history and well-developed theory that we don’t have space to get into. An interesting debate in the field has been whether many naturally occurring networks are scale-free—including internet pages, social networks, biological networks, and even airline travel networks—and if so, why this might be.</p>
<p>There are a variety of approaches for generating scale-free networks; one of the more popular options is conveniently implemented in igraph with the <code>sample_pa()</code> function. It relies on what is known as the Barabási–Albert model.</p>
<h3 id="h2-503083c02-0020"><a class="XrefDestination" id="Watts–StrogatzGraphs"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-503083c02-029"/>Watts–Strogatz Graphs</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Watts–Strogatz graphs</em> are networks generated by a random graph model introduced in 1998 that tends to produce even more small-world properties than scale-free networks, such as tightly interconnected communities and small network distances between many vertices. These networks frequently include paths that are reinforced by redundancy and alternate routes. They are common in biology and social processes. For example, brain connectivity networks at the neuron and functional area levels, voter networks, influencer networks on social media platforms, and food webs often form Watts–Strogatz networks.</p>
<p class="BodyFirst">Since we have already seen a few examples of Erdös–Renyi graphs (see Figures 2-14 and 2-15), let’s create some networks of these other types. In <a href="#figure2-16" id="figureanchor2-16">Figure 2-16</a>, we use <code>sample_pa(100,power=2.5,directed=F)</code> to generate a couple of scale-free networks, and we use <code>sample_smallworld(1,100,2,0.05)</code> to generate a couple of Watts–Strogatz networks. We leave it to a motivated reader to look in the igraph documentation to learn about the parameter choices in this latter function.</p>

</figure>
<p>The scale-free networks in the top row each have one prominent hub, and the network on the left additionally has a less prominent secondary hub. Imagining these to be power grid connections, a storm that takes out a main hub would impact many more customers in the scale-free network than in the Watts–Strogatz network. This is why many planned real-world networks conform to a redundancy-heavy structure. The Watts–Strogatz networks do not exhibit strong hubs like scale-free networks, but they have a lot of structure not seen in the purely random Erdös–Renyi networks. For instance, the lengthy reinforced path structures mentioned earlier are easy to recognize in these bottom plots.</p>

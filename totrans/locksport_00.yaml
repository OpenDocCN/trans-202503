    be interested in writing a book about lockpicking. Knowing full well my ego would
    agree wholeheartedly to having my name on a bookshelf, I still respectfully declined.
    What could I possibly bring to the table that hasn’t been said already? Several
    books on lockpicking already exist, and other publications can be found online.

    three continents (and even more time zones) that Matt organized, we began discussing
    books. Matt had recently published a wonderful book with No Starch, *Pentesting
    Azure Applications*, and they would be happy to have him write another—maybe on
    lockpicking this time? While we were discussing this informally, we quickly noticed
    that our group included several experts in various lockpicking fields, and suggestions
    for chapters kept pouring in.

    on locksport specifically, something clicked. Yes, lockpicking and impressioning
    information is out there, but nothing has really focused on the *sport* aspect.
    Books on lockpicking or covert entry often overlook information that is critical
    to competing in locksport competitions. Locksmithing references tend to concentrate
    on minutiae that is irrelevant to hobbyists.

    rather unique hobby. Your reason might be that you saw lockpicking on YouTube
    and thought it looked fun. Maybe you are a locksmith and decided to see if you
    were the fastest person in your shop to open a lock, or maybe you ran into one
    of us at a conference and spent some time learning to open locks. Lockpicking
    is a superpower, and just like comic book heroes, your reason for joining this
    community is your *origin story*. We wanted to share ours with you.

    all the cyberz. With that interest in mind, I visited several of the Dutch, open-air
    hacker camps, where I was first introduced to the concept of locksport. This,
    of course, reignited my interest in physical things that shouldn’t be tinkered
    with and therefore shall be tinkered with. Buying gear on the internet wasn’t
    really a thing in those days, so being able to buy an actual lockpick set at these

    arranged in the office. Visiting Seattle from the Netherlands was Jos Weyers,
    who was accompanied by locksmith and locksporter Holly Poer. The two taught several

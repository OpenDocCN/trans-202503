    be interested in writing a book about lockpicking. Knowing full well my ego would
    agree wholeheartedly to having my name on a bookshelf, I still respectfully declined.
    What could I possibly bring to the table that hasn’t been said already? Several
    books on lockpicking already exist, and other publications can be found online.

    information is out there, but nothing has really focused on the *sport* aspect.

  zh: 我喜欢认为那是我第一次撬的锁，但在同一时期也有其他可能性。我有一个弟弟，所以我在我的卧室门上装了一个闩，并且在我的小屋上挂了一个挂锁。（是的，我有自己的小屋！这可能能解释很多事情。）那个挂锁很便宜，我又很懒，所以我很快养成了撬锁的习惯，而不是走到屋里拿钥匙。我记得我曾经撬开过很多很多次。用什么工具我不知道——可能是我在我爸的工作坊里做的某个东西。

- en: Around that same time, my school got new computer equipment, which was stored
    inside our school desk drawers. One day I watched a handyman installing the little
    “locks” I now know to be nothing more than a star key driving a bolt, designed
    for windows. After he had finished installing the lock on my desk, I asked what
    he was doing, and he told me he was adding locks so we couldn’t play with the
    equipment. I picked up his Phillips screwdriver and unlocked the drawer. His jaw
    dropped. I can only hope, looking back, that he was a handyman and not a locksmith.

  zh: 大约在那个时候，我的学校换了新的计算机设备，存放在我们的课桌抽屉里。有一天，我看见一个修理工安装了我现在知道的只是用星型钥匙驱动螺栓的“小锁”，这设计用于窗户。当他完成在我桌子上安装锁具时，我问他在做什么，他告诉我他是在加锁，这样我们就不能乱玩设备了。我拿起他的十字螺丝刀，打开了抽屉。他的下巴掉了下来。回头看，我只能希望他真的是个修理工，而不是一名锁匠。

    and a short career in aerospace, eventually starting up a locksmithing business
    in 2005, the same year that I first went to a TOOOL event—the Dutch national lockpicking
    championships at a hacker camp. I’ve never looked back.

- en: 'The tiny niche of physical security (PhySec) is still, once you look closely,
    a vast, vast arena with a thousand genuine niche disciplines. Rarely do I see
    the same thing twice. In addition to locks, I cover alarms and CCTV, plus some
    aspects of information security (InfoSec)—primarily testing Internet of Things
    (IoT) devices for physical attack vectors. I have advised on books and film and
    have appeared on TV. I’ve created new CAD methods for copying the largest antique
    keys, and I’ve worked on photogrammetry methods for copying modern restricted
    keys. I’ve designed and sold several locksmith tools, one of which I bothered
    to patent and a few of which I’ve managed to sell to other companies. I have seen
    much more than just lever locks in my day-to-day work: everything people have
    made and fitted over hundreds of years on everything from cars to vaults, castles
    to mobile homes, including more than a few custom creations by aspiring lock designers,
    well-known manufacturers, and even drug dealers!'

  zh: 物理安全（PhySec）这个小众领域，一旦你仔细观察，就会发现它其实是一个庞大无比的领域，拥有上千个真正的小众学科。我很少看到两次完全相同的事物。除了锁具，我还涉及到报警系统、闭路电视（CCTV），以及一些信息安全（InfoSec）的内容——主要是测试物联网（IoT）设备的物理攻击面。我曾为书籍和电影提供建议，并出现在电视节目中。我还为复制最大型古董钥匙创造了新的计算机辅助设计（CAD）方法，并且为复制现代受限钥匙工作过摄影测量法。我设计并销售了几款锁匠工具，其中一款我特意申请了专利，还有几款成功卖给了其他公司。在我的日常工作中，我见过的远不止杠杆锁：人们为从汽车到保险箱、从城堡到房车等各种事物所制作和安装的所有东西，其中包括一些有抱负的锁具设计师、知名制造商，甚至是毒贩自制的锁具！

    This part introduces you to the world of locksport, starting with the history
    of lockpicking and a thorough description of various competitions around the globe,
    the groups that host them, and the laws that govern the sport. Then you’ll learn
    about types of locks; their inner mechanisms and high-security elements; and how
    to disassemble, troubleshoot, and maintain your practice locks.'

    This first hands-on part of the book focuses on pin tumbler locks, the most common
    and budget-friendly type and thus a good introduction to locksport. You’ll see
    several models and learn how to work around various security elements. We’ll take
    a brief look in [Chapter 7](ch7.xhtml) at a few locks other than the standard
    pin tumbler, but the principles of picking them remain largely the same.'

    In this part, we’ll turn to impressioning, the art of fashioning a working key
    from a blank by reading marks made by the lock. Once a common skill among locksmiths,
    impressioning is now rarely used in the field, but it has gained in popularity
    since its arrival on the locksport scene in the early 2000s.'

    The focus of this part is manipulating safe locks, a much more detailed and nuanced
    process than spy movies would have you believe. You’ll learn all about how to
    get feedback from safe locks, chart the clues you find, and zero in on the lock’s

A lighthouse flashed. Flashed. Flashed. Flashed.</p><p>The flashes didn’t carry any messages this night. The fog was too thick to send signals,
so the Network was down. The powerful lights were needed for their original purpose: to warn boats
away from dangerous rocks.</p><p>As it happened, only one boat was around, and it didn’t need warning. It was exactly
where it was supposed to be.</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Jargonaut</em></span> was the boat, and Kevin Kelvin was its captain. The boat
was large and flat and plain. Near the front was a little cabin where Kelvin lived. The rest of the
deck was taken up by a crane and a winch—a machine built to wind wire in or out. A wire led
from the crane and into the water, looking like a large fishing pole. Belowdecks was mostly a hold
for tons and tons of coiled wire.</p><p>It wouldn’t be accurate to say that the <span class="emphasis"><em>Jargonaut</em></span> was a gigantic
boat with a winch attached to it. That might give you the wrong impression. It would be better to
describe it as a gigantic <span class="emphasis"><em>winch</em></span> with a boat attached to it. Its entire purpose
in life was to play out and wind up miles of heavy wire.</p><p>Inside the cabin, Kevin Kelvin rubbed his hands together to keep them warm. A thermometer hung
from a peg near the door. It read a chilly 273. <span class="emphasis"><em>Brrrrr!</em></span> Now, 273 degrees might
sound pretty hot to you and me, but this thermometer didn’t measure in degrees Fahrenheit or
Celsius. It was on the Kelvin Scale, one of the captain’s many inventions. The Kelvin Scale
starts at Absolute Zero, the coldest that any cold thing can possibly get. And 273 Kelvin
isn’t much better. It’s about the temperature of an ice cube.
<span class="emphasis"><em>Brrrrr!</em></span></p><p>The thermometer said a lot about the kind of person Kevin Kelvin was. He was a Composer, and a
wickedly smart one. He never let a good idea escape without putting his name on it.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00055a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00055"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/152fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>When people asked Kelvin what he was doing, he would say he was fishing. He never explained
what he was fishing <span class="emphasis"><em>for</em></span>, in the middle of the night with a gigantic winch that
had a boat attached to it. When people made jokes about catching sea monsters, Kelvin only smiled.
No one knew what he knew. How could they?</p><p>Kevin Kelvin was fishing for teeny-tiny bits of electricity flowing up his Wire. The Wire
traveled under the ocean for miles, all the way to a little building on the shore, not far from the
lighthouse. He twiddled dials, and listened carefully to a nearby speaker connected to the Wire, and
made notes. If his ideas were right, any moment now he should hear a signal from his assistant on
the other end. It would sound like—</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>BEEP.</p></blockquote></div><p>His skin tingled with excitement, but he didn’t dare make a sound.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>BLOOP. BEEP.</p></blockquote></div><p>Kelvin quickly disconnected some wires and connected some other ones. He flicked a switch on
and off.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>FLIP. FLOP. FLIP.</p></blockquote></div><p>The Wire answered back.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>BLOOP.</p></blockquote></div><p>The Wire worked! Just as Kelvin thought: he could send messages using electricity, even under
miles of seawater. If the <span class="emphasis"><em>Jargonaut</em></span> laid down a Wire all the way between two
islands, that would form the first link in Kelvin’s very own Network. A Network that could
send messages all the time, even on a terrible night like this. A Network that, someday, could even
have <span class="emphasis"><em>multiple Wires</em></span>.</p><p>Those fools up there in their ivory towers, flashing their little lights, will never know what
hit them!</p></div></body></html>

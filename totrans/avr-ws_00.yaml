- en: A *microcontroller* (or *MCU* for short) is a small, complete computer that
    fits on a single integrated circuit. Just like your desktop computer, a microcontroller
    contains a processor, memory, devices to receive input from various sources, and
    outputs that can be used to control or communicate with external devices.

- en: Thanks to the success of development platforms like Arduino and PICAXE, microcontrollers
    are being used increasingly often in the electronics field and among hobbyists
    and hackers. Such platforms simplify projects for beginners, but they can be costly;
    they also put a layer of abstraction between the user and the microcontroller,
    which decreases the microcontroller’s performance and often prevents the user
    from accessing its full set of features. More experienced users may want to control
    the microcontroller directly or use less expensive parts in their projects. Or,
    if you’re a beginner, you may want to start your microcontroller journey without
    any artificially imposed overheads.

- en: That’s where this book comes in. Whether you’re an absolute beginner or a longtime
    electronics enthusiast, *AVR Workshop* shows you how to take advantage of two
    chips from the inexpensive range of Microchip AVR 8-bit microcontrollers made
    famous in the Arduino and compatible boards. Once you master these chips, you’ll
    be able to maximize their performance to create powerful projects with cheaper
    hardware. Along the way you’ll learn about electronics, C programming, and much
    more.

- en: I’ll walk you through over 55 projects of increasing difficulty based around
    the ATtiny85 and ATmega328P-PU microcontrollers from Microchip, and I’ll explain
    and demonstrate everything you need to know for each project. You’ll start off
    blinking a small light, then move on to keeping time, capturing and analyzing
    real-world data such as temperatures, and even controlling small motorized devices.
    This book doesn’t cover AVR for IoT, as that’s a more advanced topic, but after
    completing the projects here, you’ll be able to harness a wide variety of devices,
    sensors, motors, displays, and more with your AVR microcontroller to bring your
    dreams and ideas to life.

- en: I’ve written this book for a wide variety of people. You might be a student
    wanting to get a head start with microcontrollers, an electronics hobbyist with
    no prior experience in digital or microcontroller circuitry, an employee who wants
    to increase their knowledge base for work, or just someone who enjoys making things.
    This book is for anyone interested in learning more about AVR technology and harnessing
    it to create their own projects.

- en: My goal is that you’ll leave this book with lasting knowledge and the confidence
    to keep learning and making. [Chapter 1](nsp-boxall502581-0011.xhtml#ch01) will
    get you started by introducing a few cool real-world projects that use AVR microcontrollers,
    then showing you how to set up your own workstation.

<div class="image1"><img src="Images/com.jpg" alt="Image" width="204" height="204"/></div>
<p class="noindents">This chapter describes <em>class diagrams</em>, one of the more important diagramming tools in UML. Class diagrams are the basis for defining data types, data structures, and operations on that data in programs. In turn, they’re the basis for <em>object-oriented analysis (OOA)</em> and <em>object-oriented design (OOD)</em>.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev-6.1"><strong>6.1 Object-Oriented Analysis and Design in UML</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The creators of UML wanted a formal system for designing object-oriented software to replace the structured programming formalisms available at the time (1990s). Here we’ll discuss how to represent classes (data types) and objects (instance variables of data types) in UML.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_104"/>The most complete form of a class diagram in UML is shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig1">Figure 6-1</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig1"/><img src="Images/fig6-1.jpg" alt="image" width="152" height="116"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-1: A complete class diagram</em></p>
<p class="indent"><em>Attributes</em> correspond to data field members of a class (that is, variables and constants); they represent information internal to the class.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Operations</em> correspond to the activities that represent the class’s behavior. Operations include methods, functions, procedures, and other things we normally identify as code.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes, you don’t need to list all the attributes and operations when referencing a class diagram (or there might not even be any attributes or operations). In such situations, you can instead draw a partial class diagram, shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig2">Figure 6-2</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig2"/><img src="Images/fig6-2.jpg" alt="image" width="333" height="78"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-2: Partial class diagrams</em></p>
<p class="indent">The fact that attributes or operations are missing from a partial class diagram doesn’t imply that they don’t exist; it just means that it’s not necessary in the current context to add them to the diagram. The designer might be leaving it up to the coder to fill them in during coding; or perhaps the complete class diagram appears elsewhere, and the current diagram contains only information of interest.</p>
<p class="indent">In its simplest form, UML represents classes with a simple rectangle containing the name of the class, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig3">Figure 6-3</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig3"/><img src="Images/fig6-3.jpg" alt="image" width="152" height="40"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-3: A simple class diagram</em></p>
<p class="indent">Again, this doesn’t imply that the class contains no attributes or operations (which wouldn’t make sense); it just means that those items are not of interest in the current diagram.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev-6.2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_105"/><strong>6.2 Visibility in a Class Diagram</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">UML defines four types of class member <em>visibility</em> (all taken from C++ and Java, although other languages, such as Swift, also support them): public, private, protected, and package. We’ll discuss each in turn.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.2.1"><strong><em>6.2.1 Public Class Visibility</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">A public class member is visible to all classes and code, inside and outside the class containing the public item. In well-designed object-oriented systems, public items are almost always operations (methods, functions, procedures, and so forth) and form the class’s interface to the world outside the class. Although you can also make attributes public, doing so often defeats one of the primary benefits of object-oriented programming: <em>encapsulation</em>, or the ability to hide values and activities inside a class from the outside world.</p>
<p class="indent">In UML we preface public attributes and operations with the plus sign (<code>+</code>), as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig4">Figure 6-4</a>. The set of public attributes and operations provides the class’s <em>public interface</em>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig4"/><img src="Images/fig6-4.jpg" alt="image" width="187" height="134"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-4: Public attributes and operations</em></p>
<p class="indent">This figure has a single public attribute, <code>maxSalinity_c</code>. The <code>_c</code> suffix is a convention I use to indicate that the field is a <em>constant</em> rather than a variable.<sup><a href="ch19_footnote.xhtml#ch06fn1" id="ch06fn1a">1</a></sup> In good designs constants are usually the only public attributes in a class, because external code cannot change the value of a constant: it’s still visible (that is, not hidden or encapsulated), but it’s unchangeable. One of the main reasons for encapsulation is to prevent side effects that can occur when some external code changes an internal class attribute. Because external code cannot change a constant’s value, this immutability achieves the same result as encapsulation; therefore, object-oriented designers are willing to make certain class constants visible.<sup><a href="ch19_footnote.xhtml#ch06fn2" id="ch06fn2a">2</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.2.2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_106"/>6.2.2 Private Class Visibility</h4>
<p class="noindent">At the other end of the spectrum lies private visibility. Private attributes and operations are accessible only within that class: they’re hidden from other classes and code. Private attributes and operations are the embodiment of encapsulation.</p>
<p class="indent">We use the minus sign (<code>-</code>) to denote private entities within a class diagram, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig5">Figure 6-5</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig5"/><img src="Images/fig6-5.jpg" alt="image" width="214" height="302"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-5: Private attributes and operations</em></p>
<p class="indent">You should use private visibility for any attribute or operation that doesn’t absolutely require some other form of visibility, and strive to ensure that all attributes (data fields in the class) are private members of the class. If outside code needs to access a data field, you can use public <em>accessor</em> functions (getters and setters) to provide access to the private class member. A <em>getter</em> function returns the value of a private field. A <em>setter</em> function stores a value into a private field.</p>
<p class="indent">If you’re wondering why you should even bother using accessor functions (after all, it’s a whole lot easier to simply access the data field directly<sup><a href="ch19_footnote.xhtml#ch06fn3" id="ch06fn3a">3</a></sup>), consider this: a setter function can check the value you’re storing in an attribute to ensure it’s within range. Also, not all fields are independent of all other attributes in a class. For example, in a saltwater pool, the salinity, chlorine, and pH levels aren’t completely independent of one another: the pool contains an electrolysis cell that converts water and sodium chloride (salt) into sodium hydroxide and chlorine. This conversion reduces the salinity and increases the chlorine and pH levels. So rather than allowing some external code to arbitrarily change the salinity level, you might want to pass the change through a setter function that can decide whether to adjust other levels at the same time.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.2.3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_107"/><strong><em>6.2.3 Protected Class Visibility</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Although public and private visibility covers a large percentage of the visibility requirements, in some special situations, like inheritance, you’ll need to use something in between: protected visibility.</p>
<p class="indent">Inheritance, along with encapsulation and polymorphism, is one of the “big three” features of object-oriented programming. Inheritance allows one class to receive all the features from another class.</p>
<p class="indent">One problem with private visibility is that <em>you cannot access private fields within classes that inherit them</em>. Protected visibility, however, relaxes these restrictions to allow access by inheriting classes, but it doesn’t allow access to private fields outside the original class or its inheriting classes.</p>
<p class="indent">UML notation uses the hash symbol (<code>#</code>) to denote protected visibility, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig6">Figure 6-6</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig6"/><img src="Images/fig6-6.jpg" alt="image" width="215" height="190"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-6: Protected attributes and operations</em></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.2.4"><strong><em>6.2.4 Package Class Visibility</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Package visibility sits between private and protected and is largely a Java concept. Other languages have something similar, including Swift, C++, and C#, in which you can use namespaces to simulate package visibility, although the semantics aren’t quite the same.</p>
<p class="indent">Package-protected fields are visible among all classes in the same package. Classes outside the package (even if they inherit from the class containing the package-protected fields) cannot access items with package visibility.</p>
<p class="indent">We use the tilde (<code>~</code>) to denote package visibility, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig7">Figure 6-7</a>. <a href="ch08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a> discusses UML package notation (that is, how to place several classes in the same package).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig7"/><img src="Images/fig6-7.jpg" alt="image" width="215" height="115"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-7: Package attributes and operations</em></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.2.5"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_108"/><strong><em>6.2.5 Unsupported Visibility Types</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">What happens if your programming language of choice doesn’t support the same visibility types that UML specifies? Well, the good news is that UML visibility is largely a spectrum, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig8">Figure 6-8</a>.<sup><a href="ch19_footnote.xhtml#ch06fn4" id="ch06fn4a">4</a></sup></p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig8"/><img src="Images/fig6-8.jpg" alt="image" width="596" height="81"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-8: Visibility spectrum</em></p>
<p class="indent">You can always substitute a more public visibility for a more private visibility if your programming language doesn’t support a specific visibility. For example, the High-Level Assembly (HLA) language supports only public fields; C++ only partially supports package visibility (using <code>friend</code> declarations or <em>namespaces</em>); and Swift supports an offshoot of package visibility—all private fields within an object are automatically visible to all classes declared in the same source file. One way to avoid abusing the extra visibility is to add some sort of visibility notation to the attribute or operation’s name in the class—for example, by prefacing protected names with <code>prot_</code> and then declaring them as public objects, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig9">Figure 6-9</a>.</p>

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-9: Faking visibility restriction</em></p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev-6.3"><strong>6.3 Class Attributes</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Attributes in a UML class (also known as <em>data fields</em> or simply <em>fields</em>) hold the data associated with an object. An attribute has a visibility and a name; it can also have a data type and an initial value, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig10">Figure 6-10</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig10"/><img src="Images/fig6-10.jpg" alt="image" width="224" height="97"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-10: Attributes</em></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.3.1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_109"/><strong><em>6.3.1 Attribute Visibility</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">As discussed earlier, you specify the visibility of an attribute by prefixing its name with the <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>#</code>, or <code>~</code> symbols, which specify public, private, protected, and package visibility, respectively. See “<a href="ch06.xhtml#lev-6.2">Visibility in a Class Diagram</a>” on <a href="ch06.xhtml#page_105">page 105</a> for more details.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.3.2"><strong><em>6.3.2 Attribute Derived Values</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Most of the time, a class stores the value of an attribute as a variable or constant data field (a <em>base</em> value). However, some fields contain <em>derived</em> values rather than base values. The class calculates a derived value whenever some expression references that attribute. Some languages, like Swift, provide syntax for directly defining declared values; in other languages (such as C++), you’ll typically write getter and setter accessor functions to implement a derived value.</p>
<p class="indent">To create a derived attribute in UML, you immediately precede the attribute name (after the visibility symbol) with a forward slash (<code>/</code>), as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig11">Figure 6-11</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig11"/><img src="Images/fig6-11.jpg" alt="image" width="509" height="200"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-11: A derived attribute</em></p>
<p class="indent">Whenever you use a derived attribute, somewhere you must define how to calculate it. <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig11">Figure 6-11</a> uses a comment for this purpose, although you could also use a <em>property string</em> (see “<a href="ch06.xhtml#lev-6.3.8">Property Strings</a>” on <a href="ch06.xhtml#page_112">page 112</a>).</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.3.3"><strong><em>6.3.3 Attribute Names</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The attribute name should work in whichever programming language(s) you use to implement the design. As much as possible, you should refrain from naming syntax or conventions that are specific to a programming language unless you’re requiring implementation in that language. As a general rule, the following conventions work well for UML attribute names:</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent">All names should begin with an (ASCII) alphabetic character (a–z or A–Z).</li>
<li class="noindent">After the first character, names should contain only ASCII alphabetic characters (a–z, A–Z), numeric digits (0–9), or underscores (_).</li>
<li class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_110"/>All names should be unique within the first six to eight characters (some compilers allow arbitrary-length names but keep only a prefix of them in the internal symbol table during compilation).</li>
<li class="noindent">Names should be shorter than some arbitrary length (we’ll use 32 characters here).</li>
<li class="noindent">All names should be <em>case neutral</em>; that is, two separate names must contain at least one distinct character rather than just a difference in case. Also, all occurrences of a given name should be consistent with respect to alphabetic case.<sup><a href="ch19_footnote.xhtml#ch06fn5" id="ch06fn5a">5</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.3.4"><em>6.3.4 Attribute Data Types</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">A UML object can optionally have an associated data type (see the examples in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig10">Figure 6-10</a>). UML doesn’t require you to explicitly state the data type; if it’s absent, the assumption is that the reader can infer it from the attribute’s name or usage, or that the programmer will decide on a type while implementing the design.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use any type names you want for primitive data types and leave it up to the programmer to choose the appropriate or closest matching data type when writing the code. That being said, when working with generic data types most people choose C++ or Java type names (which makes sense, because UML’s design was largely based on these two languages). Common data types you’ll find attached to UML attributes include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent"><code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>unsigned</code>, <code>unsigned long</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>unsigned short</code></li>
<li class="noindent"><code>float</code>, <code>double</code></li>
<li class="noindent"><code>char</code>, <code>wchar</code></li>
<li class="noindent"><code>string</code>, <code>wstring</code></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Of course, any user-defined type names are perfectly valid as well. For example, if you’ve defined <code>uint16_t</code> to mean the same thing as <code>unsigned short</code> in your design, then using <code>uint16_t</code> as an attribute type is perfectly acceptable. In addition, any class objects you define in UML also make perfectly good data type names.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.3.5"><strong><em>6.3.5 Operation Data Types (Return Values)</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">You can also associate a data type with an operation. Functions, for example, can return a value having some data type. To specify a return data type, follow the operation name (and parameter list) with a colon and the data type, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig12">Figure 6-12</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig12"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_111"/><img src="Images/fig6-12.jpg" alt="image" width="221" height="97"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-12: Return types</em></p>
<p class="indent">We’ll discuss operations more in “Class Operations” on <a href="ch06.xhtml#page_112">page 112</a>.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.3.6"><strong><em>6.3.6 Attribute Multiplicity</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Some attributes could contain a collection (array or list) of data objects. In UML we denote multiplicity using square brackets <code>[]</code>, similar to array declarations in many high-level languages; see <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig13">Figure 6-13</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig13"/><img src="Images/fig6-13.jpg" alt="image" width="509" height="192"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-13: Multiplicity</em></p>
<p class="indent">Within the brackets, you specify an expression, which can be any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent">A numeric value (for example, <code>5</code>) indicating the number of elements in the collection</li>
<li class="noindent">A numeric range (for example, <code>1..5</code> or <code>0..7</code>) indicating the number of elements and valid suffix range for the collection of elements</li>
<li class="noindent">An asterisk (<code>*</code>) representing an arbitrary number of elements</li>
<li class="noindent">An asterisk-terminated range (for example, <code>0..*</code> or <code>1..*</code>) indicating an open-ended range of array elements</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">If this notation is absent, the multiplicity defaults to <code>[1]</code> (that is, a single data object).</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.3.7"><strong><em>6.3.7 Default Attribute Values</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">To specify an initial value for an attribute, you use an equal sign (<code>=</code>) followed by an expression (with a type appropriate for the attribute). This typically follows the attribute’s multiplicity (if present) and/or type. But if the type can be inferred from the initial value, you can omit both it and the multiplicity. If the multiplicity is something other than <code>1</code>, you enclose a comma-separated list of initial values, one for each element, within a pair of braces. See <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig14">Figure 6-14</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig14"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_112"/><img src="Images/fig6-14.jpg" alt="image" width="377" height="116"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-14: Initial values</em></p>
<p class="indent">In this example, the <code>numTempSensors</code> attribute is an <code>integer</code> type (which can be inferred by the initial value <code>2</code>), and <code>tempSensorSpan</code> is an array of <code>double</code>s with two elements (inferred by the number and types of values in the braces).</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.3.8"><strong><em>6.3.8 Property Strings</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">UML’s attribute syntax probably doesn’t cover every possible case for your attributes. UML provides the <em>property string</em> to handle outlier situations. To create a property string, you add text within braces at the end of the attribute that describes it, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig15">Figure 6-15</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig15"/><img src="Images/fig6-15.jpg" alt="image" width="421" height="115"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-15: Property strings</em></p>
<p class="indent">You can also use property strings to define other property types. Common examples include <code>{readOnly}</code>, <code>{unique}</code>, and <code>{static}</code>.<sup><a href="ch19_footnote.xhtml#ch06fn6" id="ch06fn6a">6</a></sup> Keep in mind that a property string is a catch-all field in the attribute. You can define any syntax you want inside the braces.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.3.9"><strong><em>6.3.9 Attribute Syntax</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The formal syntax for an attribute looks as follows (note that optional items appear in braces, except quoted braces, which represent literal brace characters):</p>
<pre>{<span class="codeitalic1">visibility</span>}{"<span class="codeitalic1">/</span>"} <span class="codeitalic1">name</span> { "<span class="codeitalic1">:</span>" <span class="codeitalic1">type</span> }{<span class="codeitalic1">multiplicity</span>}{"=" <span class="codeitalic1">initial</span>}{"{"<span class="codeitalic1">property string</span>"}"}</pre>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev-6.4"><strong>6.4 Class Operations</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Class operations are items within a class that perform actions. Generally, the operations represent the code in a class (but there can also be code associated with derived attributes, so having code is not exclusive to operations in a UML class).</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_113"/>UML class diagrams place attributes and operations into separate rectangles, though this is not what differentiates one from the other. (Consider <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig2">Figure 6-2</a>: the partial class diagrams are ambiguous with respect to which class diagram contains only attributes and which contains only operations.) In UML we explicitly specify operations within a class diagram by following the operation’s name with a (possibly empty) parameter list surrounded by parentheses (refer to <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig4">Figure 6-4</a> for an example).</p>
<p class="indent">As noted in “Operation Data Types (Return Values)” on <a href="ch06.xhtml#page_110">page 110</a>, you can also specify a return type for an operation by following the parameter list with a colon and a data type name. If the type is present, you definitely have a function; if it’s absent, you likely have a procedure (a <em>void function</em>).</p>
<p class="indent">What’s been missing in all the operation examples thus far is parameters. To specify parameters, you insert a comma-separated list of attributes within the parentheses immediately following the operation name, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig16">Figure 6-16</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig16"/><img src="Images/fig6-16.jpg" alt="image" width="421" height="134"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-16: Operation parameters</em></p>
<p class="indent">By default, parameters in a UML operation are <em>value</em> parameters, meaning they’re passed to the operation as an argument, and changes an operation makes to a value parameter do not affect the actual parameter the caller passes to the function. A value parameter is an <em>input parameter</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">UML also supports <em>output</em> parameters and <em>input/output</em> parameters. As their names suggest, output parameters return information from the operation to the calling code; input/output parameters pass information to and return data from an operation. UML uses the following syntax to denote input, output, and input/output parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent">Input parameters: <code>in</code> <em>paramName</em><code>:</code><em>paramType</em></li>
<li class="noindent">Output parameters: <code>out</code> <em>paramName</em><code>:</code><em>paramType</em></li>
<li class="noindent">Input/output parameters: <code>inout</code> <em>paramName</em><code>:</code><em>paramType</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The default parameter-passing mechanism is input. If there’s nothing specified before the parameter name, UML assumes that it is an <code>in</code> parameter. <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig17">Figure 6-17</a> shows a simple example of an <code>inout</code> parameter.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig17"/><img src="Images/fig6-17.jpg" alt="image" width="421" height="84"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-17: Parameter <span class="codeitalic">inout</span> example</em></p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_114"/>In this figure, the list of items to sort is an input <em>and</em> an output parameter. On input, the <code>items</code> array contains the data to be sorted; on output, it contains the sorted items (an in-place sort).</p>
<p class="indent">UML tries to be as generic as possible. The <code>in</code>, <code>out</code>, and <code>inout</code> parameter-passing specifiers don’t necessarily imply pass by value or pass by reference. This implementation detail is left to, well, the actual implementation. From a design point of view, UML is specifying only the direction in which, not how, the data is transferred.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev-6.5"><strong>6.5 UML Class Relationships</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In this section, we’ll explore five different types of relationships between classes: dependency, association, aggregation, composition, and inheritance.</p>
<p class="indent">Like visibility, class relationships fall along a spectrum (see <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig18">Figure 6-18</a>). This range is based on their <em>strength</em>, or the level and type of intercommunication between two classes.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig18"/><img src="Images/fig6-18.jpg" alt="image" width="696" height="90"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-18: Class relationship spectrum</em></p>
<p class="indent">Strength ranges from <em>loosely coupled</em> to <em>tightly coupled</em>. When two classes are tightly coupled, any modifications to one class will likely affect the state of the other class. Loosely coupled classes are mostly independent of each other; changes to one are unlikely to affect the other.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll discuss each type of class relationship in turn, from weakest to strongest.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.5.1"><strong><em>6.5.1 Class Dependency Relationships</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Two classes are dependent on each other when objects of one class need to <em>briefly</em> work with objects of another class. In UML we use a dashed open-ended arrow to denote a dependency relationship, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig19">Figure 6-19</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig19"/><img src="Images/fig6-19.jpg" alt="image" width="405" height="46"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-19: Dependency relationship</em></p>
<p class="indent">In this example, the <code>userInterface</code> and <code>poolMonitor</code> classes work together whenever a <code>userInterface</code> object wants to retrieve data to display (for example, when you pass a <code>poolMonitor</code> object to a <code>userInterface</code> method as a parameter). Other than that, the two classes (and objects of those classes) operate independently of each other.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.5.2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_115"/><strong><em>6.5.2 Class Association Relationships</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">An association relationship occurs when one class contains an attribute whose type is a second class. There are two ways to draw an association relationship in UML: inline attributes and association links. You’ve already seen inline attributes—they’re the normal attribute definitions you saw in “Attribute Syntax” on <a href="ch06.xhtml#page_112">page 112</a>). The only requirement is that the type name must be some other class.</p>
<p class="indent">The second way to specify a class association relationship is with an association <em>line</em> or <em>link</em>, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig20">Figure 6-20</a>.</p>

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-20: Association relationship</em></p>
<p class="indent">The <em>association name</em> is typically a verb phrase that describes the association, such as <em>has</em>, <em>owns</em>, <em>controls</em>, <em>is owned by</em>, and <em>is controlled by</em> (see <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig21">Figure 6-21</a>).</p>

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-21: Association names</em></p>
<p class="indent">How can we tell from an association diagram which class is an attribute of the other? Notice the arrowhead immediately to the left or right of the association name. This provides the direction of the association; here, it shows that the <code>poolMonitor</code> has a <code>phClass</code>, rather than the reverse.</p>
<p class="indent">But while a meaningful association name and arrowhead verb phrase can give you a clue, there’s no guarantee that your intuition will be correct. Although it might seem counterintuitive, <code>pumpClass</code> in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig21">Figure 6-21</a> could contain the <code>poolMonitor</code> object as an attribute, even though the <code>poolMonitor</code> class controls the <code>pumpClass</code> object. The UML solution is to apply <em>navigability</em> (see “<a href="ch06.xhtml#lev-6.5.5.9">Navigability</a>” on <a href="ch06.xhtml#page_123">page 123</a>) by placing an open-ended arrow pointing at the class that is an attribute of the other class, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig22">Figure 6-22</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig22"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_116"/><img src="Images/fig6-22.jpg" alt="image" width="392" height="188"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-22: Association navigability</em></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.5.3"><strong><em>6.5.3 Class Aggregation Relationships</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">An aggregation, a slightly more tightly coupled version of association, exists as a class that could be stand-alone but is part of a larger class. Most of the time, an aggregation relationship is a <em>controls</em> relationship; that is, a controlling class (the <em>aggregate</em> or <em>whole</em> class) controls a set of subservient objects or attributes (the <em>parts</em> classes). The aggregate class cannot exist without the parts classes; however, the parts classes can exist outside the context of the aggregate class (for example, a parts class could be associated with both the aggregate class and an additional class).</p>
<p class="indent">Aggregates act as <em>gatekeepers</em> to their parts attributes, ensuring that the parts’ methods are being called with appropriate (for example, range-checked) parameters and that the operating environment for those parts is consistent. The aggregate class can also check return values for consistency and handle exceptions and other issues raised by the parts.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, you could have a <code>pHSensor</code> class that works well with a stand-alone pH meter and a <code>salinitySensor</code> class that works well with a stand-alone salinity (or conductivity) sensor. The <code>poolMonitor</code> class is not a stand-alone class: it needs both of these classes to do its job, even though they don’t need <code>poolMonitor</code> to do theirs. We model this relationship using an empty diamond symbol on the aggregate class (<code>poolMonitor</code>) and an association line leading to the parts classes (<code>pHSensor</code> and <code>salinitySensor</code>), as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig23">Figure 6-23</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig23"/><img src="Images/fig6-23.jpg" alt="image" width="392" height="137"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-23: Aggregation relationship</em></p>
<p class="indent">The class with the open diamond end of the association line (that is, the aggregated class) always contains the attribute-associated class (the parts class) at the other end of the line.</p>
<p class="indent">The lifetimes of an aggregate object and its associated parts objects are not necessarily the same. You could create several parts objects and then attach them to an aggregate object. When the aggregate object finishes its task, it can be deallocated while the parts objects continue to solve other <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_117"/>problems. In other words, from a low-level programming perspective, the system stores pointers to the parts objects in the aggregate object. When the system deallocates the storage for the aggregate object, the pointers might go away, but the objects they reference might persist (and could be pointed at by other aggregate objects in the system).</p>
<p class="indent">Why use an aggregate diagram? The code produced for an association and an aggregation will be identical. The difference is one of intent. In an aggregation diagram, the designer is saying that the parts objects or classes are under the control of the aggregate class or object. To return to our <code>poolMonitor</code> example, in the aggregation relationship, the <code>poolMonitor</code> is in complete charge—the <code>salinitySensor</code> and <code>pHSensor</code> objects are being controlled by it, and never the other way around. In an association relationship, however, the associated classes are <em>peers</em> rather than having a master/slave relationship; that is, both the <code>pHSensor</code> and <code>salinitySensor</code> could operate independently of the <code>poolMonitor</code>—and vice versa—sharing information only as necessary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.5.4"><strong><em>6.5.4 Class Composition Relationships</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">In composition relationships, the smaller classes contained by the larger class are not stand-alone classes: they exist strictly to support the containing, or <em>composing</em>, class. Unlike with aggregates, composition parts can belong only to a single composition.</p>
<p class="indent">The lifetimes of the composing object and the parts objects are the same. When you destroy the composing object, you also destroy the parts objects it contains. The composing object is responsible for allocating and deallocating storage associated with the parts.</p>
<p class="indent">We use a solid diamond to denote a composition relationship, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig24">Figure 6-24</a>.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.5.5"><strong><em>6.5.5 Relationship Features</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">For dependency, association, aggregation, and composition relationships, UML supports these 10 features, some of which you’ve already seen:</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="lev-6.5.5.1"><strong>6.5.5.1 Association and Attribute Names</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">The association name attached to a link can tell you the type or ownership of the interaction, but it doesn’t tell you how the two classes refer to each other. The association link only provides a connection between the two class objects. Classes refer to each other using attribute and operation fields in the class definition.</p>
<p class="indent">As you read in “Class Association Relationships” on <a href="ch06.xhtml#page_115">page 115</a>, the association diagram is effectively an alternative to the inline syntax for incorporating an attribute or operation name within a class. The two diagrams in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig25">Figure 6-25</a> are equivalent.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig25"/><img src="Images/fig6-25.jpg" alt="image" width="381" height="192"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-25: Shorthand (top) and longhand (bottom) association relationship diagrams</em></p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig25">Figure 6-25</a>, the shorthand version is missing the attribute or operation name (<code>pHSensor</code> in this example) and the visibility (<code>-</code>, or private), but you can supply these missing pieces by attaching the attribute name to the association link nearest the object that will hold the object reference data field, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig26">Figure 6-26</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Like the inline syntax, an attribute name consists of an attribute or operation name with a visibility symbol prefix (<code>-</code>, <code>~</code>, <code>#</code>, or <code>+</code>). The visibility <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_119"/>symbol must be present because it differentiates an attribute name from a role (described next).</p>

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-26: Attribute name</em></p>

<h5 class="h5" id="lev-6.5.5.2"><strong>6.5.5.2 Roles</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig27">Figure 6-27</a>, it isn’t entirely clear what the two classes are doing. The <code>poolMonitor</code> class has a <code>pHSensor</code> field that connects to the <code>pHClass</code>, but otherwise the diagram doesn’t explain what’s going on. <em>Roles</em>, which typically appear at both ends of the association link, provide this missing description.</p>
<p class="indent">In this example, the <code>poolMonitor</code> class or object generally reads the pH value from a pH sensor device (encapsulated in <code>pHClass</code>). Conversely, the <code>pHClass</code> class or object can supply pH readings. You can describe these two activities (reading pH and supplying a pH value) using roles in UML. <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig28">Figure 6-28</a> shows an example of these roles.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig28"/><img src="Images/fig6-28.jpg" alt="image" width="438" height="56"/></div>

<h5 class="h5" id="lev-6.5.5.3"><strong>6.5.5.3 Interface Specifiers</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">An <em>interface</em> is a set of operations expected from certain classes. It’s similar to a class except there are no objects instantiated from it. Classes that adhere to an interface are guaranteed to provide all the operations present in it (and provide methods for those operations). If you’re a C++ programmer, you can think of an interface as an abstract base class containing only abstract member functions. Java, C#, and Swift have their own special syntax for defining interfaces (also known as <em>protocols</em>).</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>Interface specifiers are supported in UML 1.</em>x <em>but have been dropped from UML 2.0. I describe them in this chapter because you might encounter them, but you shouldn’t use them in new UML documents because they’re deprecated.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">If a class implements an interface, it’s effectively inheriting all the operations from that interface. That is, if an interface provides operations A, B, and C, and some class implements that interface, that class must also <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_120"/>provide operations A, B, and C (and provide concrete implementations of these operations). There are two distinct ways to specify an interface—with <em>stereotype</em> or <em>ball</em> notation, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig29">Figure 6-29</a>.</p>

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-29: Interface syntax: stereotype (top) and ball (bottom) notation</em></p>
<p class="indent">To show that a class implements a given interface, you draw a dashed line with a hollow arrowhead from the class to the interface diagram, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig30">Figure 6-30</a>.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="lev-6.5.5.4"><strong>6.5.5.4 Visibility</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">Visibility applies to attribute names in an association link. As noted earlier, all attribute names must be prefixed with a symbol (<code>-</code>, <code>~</code>, <code>#</code>, or <code>+</code>) that specifies their visibility (private, package, protected, or public, respectively).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="lev-6.5.5.5"><strong>6.5.5.5 Multiplicity</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">The section “<a href="ch06.xhtml#lev-6.3.6">Attribute Multiplicity</a>” on <a href="ch06.xhtml#page_111">page 111</a> described multiplicity for inline attributes. You can also include multiplicity in association diagrams by specifying multiplicity values at either or both ends of an association link (see <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig31">Figure 6-31</a>). Place multiplicity values above or below the link and closest to the class or object to which they apply. If a multiplicity value is not provided, it defaults to <code>1</code>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig31"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_121"/><img src="Images/fig6-31.jpg" alt="image" width="438" height="196"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-31: Multiplicity on an association link</em></p>
<p class="indent"><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig31">Figure 6-31</a> indicates that there is a single <code>poolMonitor</code> object, and it can have one or more associated <code>pHSensor</code>s (there could be, for example, separate pH sensors in the spa and in the swimming pool proper).</p>
<p class="indent">This example shows a <em>one-to-many</em> relationship. It’s also possible to have <em>many-to-one</em> and even <em>many-to-many</em> relationships in these diagrams. For example, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig32">Figure 6-32</a> shows a many-to-many relationship between <code>poolMonitor</code> and <code>pHClass</code> classes or objects (if you’re having a hard time visualizing how this would work, consider a water park that has multiple pools with multiple pH meters).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="lev-6.5.5.6"><strong>6.5.5.6 Ordering</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">UML provides the <code>{ordered}</code> constraint, which you can attach to any association that has a multiplicity other than <code>1</code> (see <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig33">Figure 6-33</a>).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig33"/><img src="Images/fig6-33.jpg" alt="image" width="477" height="76"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-33: An ordered association</em></p>
<p class="indent">When appearing by itself, the <code>{ordered}</code> constraint doesn’t specify how to order the list of items, only that they <em>are</em> ordered. The type of ordering must be handled by the implementation.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="lev-6.5.5.7"><strong>6.5.5.7 Constraints</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">A constraint is application-specific text within braces that you attach to an association link. Although UML has some predefined constraints (like the <code>{ordered}</code> constraint just mentioned), you usually create your own to provide some application-defined control over the association link. You can even specify multiple constraints by separating them with commas within the braces. For example, the singular <code>{ordered}</code> constraint in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig33">Figure 6-33</a> doesn’t describe how to sort the temperature history information. You can specify <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_122"/>the ordering by adding another constraint to the diagram, such as <code>sorted by date/time</code>, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig34">Figure 6-34</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig34"/><img src="Images/fig6-34.jpg" alt="image" width="477" height="97"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-34: A custom constraint</em></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="lev-6.5.5.8"><strong>6.5.5.8 Qualifiers</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">A qualifier informs the implementer that a specified association requires fast access, typically using a key or index value. For example, suppose the temperature recording mechanism in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig34">Figure 6-34</a> records the pool temperature every minute. Over the span of a week, the history object will accumulate 10,080 readings; over a year, it will accumulate more than 3.6 million readings. To extract one reading per day (say, the temperature at noon) over the past year, you have to scan through nearly 4 million readings to produce 365 or 366 readings. That could be computationally intensive and create some performance issues, particularly for real-time systems (which the pool monitor system is likely to be). We could instead give each reading a unique index value so we can extract only those we need.</p>
<p class="indent">To create a UML qualifier, you place some qualification (usually an attribute name in the qualifying class or object) in a rectangle at one end of the association link, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig35">Figure 6-35</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig35"/><img src="Images/fig6-35.jpg" alt="image" width="480" height="189"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-35: A qualifier example</em></p>
<p class="indent">The unique qualifier requires all <code>tempHistoryClass</code> objects to have unique dates and times; that is, no two readings can have the same date and time value.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig35">Figure 6-35</a> suggests that the system will maintain a special mechanism that lets us directly select a single <code>tempHistoryClass</code> object based on its <code>date_time</code> value. This is similar to a key in a database table.<sup><a href="ch19_footnote.xhtml#ch06fn7" id="ch06fn7a">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In this example, the multiplicity values are both <code>1</code> because the dates and times are all unique, and the <code>date_time</code> qualifier will pick a specific <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_123"/>date, for which there can be only one associated record. (Technically, there could be zero matches; however, the diagram doesn’t allow for that, so there must be a matching object.)</p>
<p class="indent">The multiplicity could be something other than <code>1</code> if the <code>date_time</code> key is not unique among the history objects. For example, if you want to generate a report with all the temperatures recorded at noon, you could specify that as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig36">Figure 6-36</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig36"/><img src="Images/fig6-36.jpg" alt="image" width="480" height="189"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-36: A qualifier set example</em></p>
<p class="indent">Assuming you have a year’s worth of readings in the <code>tempHistoryClass</code> object, you’ll get a set of 365/366 readings, all on different dates but at the same time (noon in this example).</p>
<p class="indent">One detail to keep in mind is that you can have multiple association diagrams that describe variants of the same association. For example, it’s not unreasonable to find <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig34">Figures 6-34</a>, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig35">6-35</a>, and <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig36">6-36</a> in the same set of UML documents. <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig34">Figure 6-34</a> describes the generic association between the <code>poolMonitor</code> class or object and the <code>tempHistoryClass</code> object. <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig35">Figure 6-35</a> might describe a search operation where you’re searching for a specific temperature; this operation might be so common that you want to generate some sort of associative array (that is, a hash table) to improve its performance. Likewise, <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig36">Figure 6-36</a> suggests that you want another fast lookup table to speed up collecting a set of readings recorded at noon. Each diagram exists in its own context; they don’t conflict with one another.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="lev-6.5.5.9"><strong>6.5.5.9 Navigability</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">In “Attribute Names” on <a href="ch06.xhtml#page_109">page 109</a>, I introduced the concept of adding attribute names to an association link. The suggestion was to place the name close to the class or object that contains the attribute (that is, that refers to the other class or object at the end of the association link). Although implicitly specifying the communication direction and attribute ownership this way works well for most simple diagrams, it can become confusing as your UML diagrams become more complex. The UML navigability feature remedies this problem.</p>
<p class="indent">Navigability specifies the direction of information flow in a diagram (that is, how the data navigates through the system). By default, association links are navigable in both directions. This means that a class/object at one end of the link can access data fields or methods at the other end. It’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_124"/>possible, however, to specify that information flows in only one direction along the association link.</p>
<p class="indent">To indicate navigability, place an arrowhead at the end of an association link to specify the direction of communication flow (you don’t need to place arrowheads on both ends of an association link to specify bidirectional communication). For example, in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig37">Figure 6-37</a>, the communication flows from the <code>poolMonitor</code> class or object to the <code>pHClass</code> class or object. This direction tells you two things: the <code>pHSensor</code> attribute is a member of the <code>poolMonitor</code> class or object, and the <code>pHClass</code> has no attributes that let it reference anything inside <code>poolMonitor</code>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig37"/><img src="Images/fig6-37.jpg" alt="image" width="392" height="56"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-37: Navigability</em></p>
<p class="indent">UML 2.<em>x</em> added a new symbol to explicitly indicate that communication doesn’t occur in a given direction: you place a small × on the association link near the side forbidding communication (see <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig38">Figure 6-38</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">I think this clutters the diagram and makes it harder to read, so I stick with the default specification. You can decide for yourself which option to use.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="lev-6.5.5.10"><strong>6.5.5.10 Changeability</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">The UML changeability feature allows you to specify whether a particular data set can be modified after its creation. In the history recording example from <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig34">Figure 6-34</a>, once a temperature is recorded in the history database, you don’t want the system or a user to edit or delete that value. You can achieve this by adding the <code>{frozen}</code> constraint to the association link, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig39">Figure 6-39</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Now that you have a better understanding of the features of the first four relationship types, let’s turn to the final type: inheritance.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev-6.5.6"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_125"/><strong><em>6.5.6 Class Inheritance Relationships</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The inheritance relationship (also known as the <em>generalization relationship</em> in UML) is the strongest, or most tightly coupled, form of class relationships. Any change you make to a base class’s fields will have an immediate and dramatic effect on the child (inheriting) classes or objects.<sup><a href="ch19_footnote.xhtml#ch06fn8" id="ch06fn8a">8</a></sup> Inheritance is a considerably different relationship than dependency, association, aggregation, or composition. These other relationships describe how one class or object uses another class or object; inheritance describes how one class <em>includes</em> everything from another class.</p>
<p class="indent">For inheritance we use a line with a hollow arrowhead at one end. The arrowhead points at the base class (the general item), and the other end of the line connects to the inheriting (derived) class, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig40">Figure 6-40</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch6fig40"/><img src="Images/fig6-40.jpg" alt="image" width="310" height="142"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 6-40: Inheritance</em></p>
<p class="indent">In this example, <code>spaMonitor</code> and <code>mainPoolMonitor</code> are <em>derived classes</em> that inherit all the fields of the base (ancestor) class <code>poolMonitor</code> (likely, these derived classes add new attributes and operations as well).</p>
<p class="indent">The inheritance relationship is not like dependency, association, aggregation, or composition in that features such as multiplicity, roles, and navigability don’t apply.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev-6.6"><strong>6.6 Objects</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">You’ve seen two types of participants in all the diagrams thus far: <em>actors</em> and <em>classes</em>. Specifically, most items have been classes. However, from an object-oriented programming point of view, classes are merely data types, not actual data items that software can manipulate. An object is an instantiation of a class—the actual data object that maintains state within an application. In UML, you represent an object using a rectangle, just as you represent classes. The difference is that you specify an object name with its associated class name, and you underline the pair in the object diagram, as shown in <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6fig41">Figure 6-41</a>.</p>

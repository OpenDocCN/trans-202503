<h2 class="h2" id="app01"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_209"/><strong><span class="big">A</span><br/>TOOLS</strong></h2>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/common.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This appendix contains a laundry list of hacking tools. Some of these tools allow you to automate your recon process, and others help you discover applications to attack. This list is not meant to be exhaustive; it only reflects tools I commonly use or know that other hackers use regularly. Also keep in mind that none of these tools should replace observation or intuitive thinking. Michiel Prins, co-founder of HackerOne, deserves credit for helping develop the initial version of this list and providing advice on how to effectively use tools when I started hacking.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app01lev1sec1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_210"/><strong>Web Proxies</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Web proxies capture your web traffic so you can analyze requests sent and responses received. Several of these tools are available free of charge, although professional versions of such tools have additional features.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>Burp Suite</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Burp Suite (<em><a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/">https://portswigger.net/burp/</a></em>) is an integrated platform for security testing. The most helpful of the tools in the platform, and the one I use 90 percent of the time, is Burp’s web proxy. Recall from the bug reports in the book that the proxy allows you to monitor your traffic, intercept requests in real time, modify them, and then forward them. Burp has an extensive set of tools, but these are the ones I find most noteworthy:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">An application-aware Spider for crawling content and functionality (either passively or actively)</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">A web scanner for automating vulnerability detection</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">A repeater for manipulating and resending individual requests</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Extensions to build additional functionality on the platform</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Burp is available for free with limited access to its tools, although you can also buy a Pro version for an annual subscription. I recommend starting with the free version until you understand how to use it. When you’re steadily finding vulnerabilities, buy the Pro edition to make your life easier.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>Charles</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Charles (<em><a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/">https://www.charlesproxy.com/</a></em>) is an HTTP proxy, an HTTP monitor, and a reverse proxy tool that enables a developer to view HTTP and SSL/HTTPS traffic. With it, you can view requests, responses, and HTTP headers (which contain cookies and caching information).</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>Fiddler</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Fiddler (<em><a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler/">https://www.telerik.com/fiddler/</a></em>) is another lightweight proxy you can use to monitor your traffic, but the stable version is only available for Windows. Mac and Linux versions are available in beta at the time of this writing.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>Wireshark</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Wireshark (<em><a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">https://www.wireshark.org/</a></em>) is a network protocol analyzer that lets you see what is happening on your network in detail. Wireshark is most useful when you’re trying to monitor traffic that can’t be proxied via Burp or ZAP. If you’re just starting out, using Burp Suite might be best if the site is only communicating over HTTP/HTTPS.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_211"/><strong>ZAP Proxy</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is a free, community-based, open source platform similar to Burp. It’s available at <em><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project</a></em>. It also has a variety of tools, including a proxy, repeater, scanner, directory/file brute-forcer, and so on. In addition, it supports add-ons so you can create additional functionality if you’re so inclined. The website has some useful information to help you get started.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app01lev1sec2"><strong>Subdomain Enumeration</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Websites often have subdomains that are hard to discover through manual work. Brute-forcing subdomains can help you identify a program’s additional attack surface.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>Amass</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">The OWASP Amass tool (<em><a href="https://github.com/OWASP/Amass">https://github.com/OWASP/Amass</a></em>) obtains subdomain names by scraping data sources, using recursive brute-forcing, crawling web archives, permuting or altering names, and using reverse DNS sweeping. Amass also uses the IP addresses obtained during resolution to discover associated netblocks and autonomous system numbers (ASNs). It then uses that information to build maps of the target networks.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong><a href="http://crt.sh">crt.sh</a></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">The <a href="http://crt.sh">crt.sh</a> website (<em><a href="https://crt.sh/">https://crt.sh/</a></em>) allows you to browse certificate transparency logs so you can find subdomains associated with certificates. Certificate registration can reveal any other subdomains a site is using. You can use the website directly or the tool SubFinder, which parses results from <a href="http://crt.sh">crt.sh</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>Knockpy</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Knockpy (<em><a href="https://github.com/guelfoweb/knock/">https://github.com/guelfoweb/knock/</a></em>) is a Python tool designed to iterate over a word list to identify a company’s subdomains. Identifying subdomains gives you a larger testable surface and increases the chances of finding a successful vulnerability.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>SubFinder</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">SubFinder (<em><a href="https://github.com/subfinder/subfinder/">https://github.com/subfinder/subfinder/</a></em>) is a subdomain discovery tool written in Go that discovers valid website subdomains by using passive online sources. It has a simple modular architecture and is meant to replace a similar tool, Sublist3r. SubFinder uses passive sources, search engines, pastebins, internet archives, and so on to find subdomains. When it finds subdomains, it uses a permutation module inspired by the tool altdns to generate permutations and a powerful brute-forcing engine to resolve them. It can also perform plain brute-forcing if needed. The tool is highly customizable, and the code is built using a modular approach, making it easy to add functionality and remove errors.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app01lev1sec3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_212"/><strong>Discovery</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When you’ve identified a program’s attack surface, the next step is to enumerate files and directories. Doing so can help you find hidden functionality, sensitive files, credentials, and so on.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>Gobuster</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Gobuster (<em><a href="https://github.com/OJ/gobuster/">https://github.com/OJ/gobuster/</a></em>) is a tool you can use to brute-force URIs (directories and files) and DNS subdomains using wildcard support. It’s extremely fast, customizable, and easy to use.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>SecLists</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Although technically not a tool in and of itself, SecLists (<em><a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/">https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/</a></em>) is a collection of word lists you can use while hacking. The lists include usernames, passwords, URLs, fuzzing strings, common directories/files/subdomains, and so on.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>Wfuzz</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Wfuzz (<em><a href="https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz/">https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz/</a></em>) allows you to inject any input in any field of an HTTP request. Using Wfuzz, you can perform complex attacks on a web application’s different components, such as its parameters, authentication, forms, directories or files, headers, and so on. You can also use Wfuzz as a vulnerability scanner when supported with plug-ins.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app01lev1sec4"><strong>Screenshotting</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In some cases, your attack surface will be too large for you to test every aspect of it. When you need to check a long list of websites or subdomains, you can use automatic screenshot tools. These tools allow you to visually inspect websites without visiting each one.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>EyeWitness</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">EyeWitness (<em><a href="https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness/">https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness/</a></em>) is designed to take screenshots of websites, provide server header information, and identify default credentials when possible. It’s a great tool for detecting which services are running on common HTTP and HTTPS ports, and you can use it with other tools, like Nmap, to quickly enumerate hacking targets.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>Gowitness</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Gowitness (<em><a href="https://github.com/sensepost/gowitness/">https://github.com/sensepost/gowitness/</a></em>) is a website screenshot utility written in Go. It uses Chrome Headless to generate screenshots of web interfaces using the command line. The project is inspired by the EyeWitness tool.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_213"/><strong>HTTPScreenShot</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">HTTPScreenShot (<em><a href="https://github.com/breenmachine/httpscreenshot/">https://github.com/breenmachine/httpscreenshot/</a></em>) is a tool for grabbing screenshots and the HTML of large numbers of websites. HTTPScreenShot accepts IPs as a list of URLs to screenshot. It can also brute-force subdomains, add them to the list of URLs to be screenshotted, and cluster results for easier review.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app01lev1sec5"><strong>Port Scanning</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In addition to finding URLs and subdomains, you’ll need to figure out what ports are available and what applications a server is running.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>Masscan</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Masscan (<em><a href="https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan/">https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan/</a></em>) claims to be the world’s fastest internet port scanner. It can scan the entire internet in less than six minutes, transmitting 10 million packets per second. It produces results similar to Nmap, only faster. In addition, Masscan allows you to scan arbitrary address ranges and port ranges.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>Nmap</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Nmap (<em><a href="https://nmap.org/">https://nmap.org/</a></em>) is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing. Nmap uses raw IP packets to determine:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Which hosts are available on a network</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Which services (along with the application name and version) those hosts are offering</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Which operating systems (and versions) they’re running</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">What type of packet filters or firewalls are in use</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="listbody">The Nmap site has a robust list of installation instructions for Windows, Mac, and Linux. In addition to port scanning, Nmap also includes scripts to build additional functionality. One script I commonly use is <code>http-enum</code> to enumerate files and directories on servers after port scanning them.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app01lev1sec6"><strong>Reconnaissance</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">After you’ve found the URIs, subdomains, and ports of websites you can test, you’ll need to learn more about the technologies they use and the other parts of the internet they’re connected to. The following tools will help you do this.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>BuiltWith</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">BuiltWith (<em><a href="http://builtwith.com/">http://builtwith.com/</a></em>) helps you fingerprint different technologies used on a target.

<p class="listhead"><strong>Shodan</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Shodan (<em><a href="https://www.shodan.io/">https://www.shodan.io/</a></em>) is a search engine for the internet of things. Shodan can help you discover which devices are connected to the internet, where they’re located, and who is using them. This is particularly helpful when you’re exploring a potential target and trying to learn as much about the target’s infrastructure as you can.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>What CMS</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">What CMS (<em><a href="http://www.whatcms.org/">http://www.whatcms.org/</a></em>) allows you to enter a URL and returns the content management system (CMS) the site is most likely using. Finding the type of CMS a site is using is helpful because:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Knowing which CMS a site uses gives you insight into the site code’s structure.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">If the CMS is open source, you can browse the code for vulnerabilities and test them on the site.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">The site might be outdated and vulnerable to disclosed security vulnerabilities.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app01lev1sec7"><strong>Hacking Tools</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Using hacking tools, you can automate not only the discovery and enumeration process, but also the processes for finding vulnerabilities.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>Bucket Finder</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Bucket Finder (<em><a href="https://digi.ninja/files/bucket_finder_1.1.tar.bz2">https://digi.ninja/files/bucket_finder_1.1.tar.bz2</a></em>) searches for readable buckets and lists all the files in them. It can also quickly find buckets that exist but don’t allow you to list files. When you find these bucket types, you can try using the AWS CLI described in the bug report “HackerOne S3 Buckets Open” on <a href="app02.xhtml#page_223">page 223</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>CyberChef</strong></p>&#13;

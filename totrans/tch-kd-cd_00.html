We use computers to solve problems, play games, help us work more effectively, perform repetitive tasks, store and recall information, create something new, and connect with our friends and the world. Understanding how to code puts all this power at our fingertips.</p><p>Everyone can learn to code; it’s just like solving a puzzle or a riddle. You apply logic, try a solution, experiment a little more, and then solve the problem. The time to start learning to code is <span class="emphasis"><em>now</em></span>! We are at an unprecedented time in history: never before could billions of people connect with one another every day like we do now with computers. We live in a world of many new possibilities, from electric cars and robot caregivers to drones that deliver packages and even pizza.</p><p>If your children start learning to code today, they can help define this fast-changing world.</p><div class="sect1" title="Why Should Kids Learn to Code?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="why_should_kids_learn_to_codequestion_ma"/>Why Should Kids Learn to Code?</h1></div></div></div><p>There are many great reasons to learn computer programming, but here are my top two:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Coding is fun.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Coding is a valuable job skill.</p></li></ul></div><div class="sect2" title="Coding Is Fun"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="coding_is_fun"/>Coding Is Fun</h2></div></div></div><p>Technology is becoming a part of everyday life. Every company, charitable organization, and cause can benefit from technology. There are apps to help you buy, give, join, play, volunteer, connect, share—just about anything you can imagine.</p><p>Have your children wanted to build their own level for their favorite video game? Coders do that! What about create their own phone app? They can bring that idea to life by programming it on a computer! Every program, game, system, or app they’ve ever seen was coded using the same programming building blocks they’ll learn in this book. When kids program, they take an active role in technology—they’re not just <span class="emphasis"><em>having</em></span> fun, they’re <span class="emphasis"><em>making</em></span> something fun!</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Coding Is a Valuable Job Skill"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="coding_is_a_valuable_job_skill"/>Coding Is a Valuable Job Skill</h2></div></div></div><p>Coding is <span class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> skill of the 21st century. Jobs today require more problem-solving ability than ever before, and more and more careers involve technology as an integral requirement.</p><p>The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that more than 8 million technology jobs will be created in just the next five years. Seven of the ten fastest-growing occupations in the 2014–2015 Occupational Outlook Handbook that do not require master’s or doctoral degrees are in the computer science or information technology (IT) fields.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg was a college student working from his dorm room when he developed the first version of Facebook in 2004. Just 10 years later, 1.39 billion people were using Facebook <span class="emphasis"><em>every month</em></span> (source: <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/">http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/</a></em></span>). Never before in history had an idea, product, or service been able to engage a billion people in under a decade. Facebook demonstrates the power of technology to reach more people, faster, than ever before.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Where Can Kids Learn to Code?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="where_can_kids_learn_to_codequestion_mar"/>Where Can Kids Learn to Code?</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is only the beginning. There are more places than ever to learn programming; websites like Code.org, Codecademy (see <a class="xref" href="pr07.html#codecademy_teaches_you_how_to_program_st" title="Figure 1. Codecademy teaches you how to program step by step in a variety of languages.">Figure 1</a>), and countless others teach basic to advanced programming in a variety of in-demand programming languages. Once you’ve completed this book with your kids, your children can take free courses through websites like EdX, Udacity, and Coursera to extend their learning even further.</p><div class="figure"><a id="codecademy_teaches_you_how_to_program_st"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00001"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages2188673.png.jpg" alt="Codecademy teaches you how to program step by step in a variety of languages."/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 1. Codecademy teaches you how to program step by step in a variety of languages.</p></div><p>“Coding clubs” are a great way to have fun learning with friends. Getting a college degree in a relevant field is still one of the best ways to prepare for a career, but even if college isn’t an option at the moment, your kids can begin building a programming portfolio and demonstrating their skills as a programmer and problem-solver today.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="How to Use This Book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="how_to_use_this_book"/>How to Use This Book</h1></div></div></div><p>This book isn’t just for kids—it’s for parents, teachers, students, and adults who want to understand the basics of computer programming, both to have fun and to gain access to new jobs in the high-tech economy. No matter what your age, you can have a great time learning the basics of programming. The best way to do this is to experiment and work together.</p><div class="sect2" title="Explore!"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="exploreexclamation_mark"/>Explore!</h2></div></div></div><p>Learning to program is exciting if you’re willing to try new things. As you and your kids follow along with the programs in this book, try changing numbers and text in the code to see what happens to the program. Even if you break it, you’ll learn something new by fixing it. In the worst case, all you have to do is retype the example from the book or open the last saved version that worked. The point of learning to code is to try something new, learn a new skill, and solve problems in a new way. Make sure your kids are playing around—testing their code by changing something, saving the program, running it, seeing what happens, and fixing any errors.</p><p>The point of learning to code is to try something new, learn a new skill, and solve problems in a new way. Test your code by changing something, saving the program, running it, seeing what happens, and fixing errors if needed.</p><p>For example, I wrote some code to make a colorful drawing (<a class="xref" href="pr07.html#three_colorful_spiral_drawings_i_created" title="Figure 2. Three colorful spiral drawings I created by trying different values in a line of code in one program">Figure 2</a>) and then went back, changed some numbers here and there, and tried running the program again. This gave me another drawing that was completely different but just as amazing. I went back again, changed some other numbers, and got yet another beautiful, unique drawing. See what you can do just by playing around?</p><div class="figure"><a id="three_colorful_spiral_drawings_i_created"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00002"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages2188677.png.jpg" alt="Three colorful spiral drawings I created by trying different values in a line of code in one program"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 2. Three colorful spiral drawings I created by trying different values in a line of code in one program</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Do It Together!"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="do_it_togetherexclamation_mark"/>Do It Together!</h2></div></div></div><p>Experimenting with code is a great way to learn how programs work, and it’s even more effective if you work with someone else. Whether you’re teaching a child or student or studying for yourself, it’s not just more <span class="emphasis"><em>fun</em></span> to play with code together—it’s also more <span class="emphasis"><em>effective</em></span>.</p><p>For example, in the Suzuki Method of music instruction, parents attend lessons with their child and even study ahead so they can help their child between lessons. Starting early is another hallmark of the Suzuki Method; kids can start formal study by the age of three or four.</p><p>I began introducing my two sons to programming when they were two and four, and I encouraged them to have fun by changing small parts of each program, like the colors, shapes, and sizes of shapes.</p><p>I learned to program at the age of 13 by typing program examples from books and then modifying them to make them do something new. Now, in the computer science courses I teach, I often give students a program and encourage them to play around with the code to build something new.</p><p>If you’re using this book to teach yourself, you can work with others by finding a friend to work through examples with you or by starting an after-school or community coding club (see <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://coderdojo.com/">http://coderdojo.com/</a></em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.codecademy.com/afterschool/">http://www.codecademy.com/afterschool/</a></em></span> for ideas and tips).

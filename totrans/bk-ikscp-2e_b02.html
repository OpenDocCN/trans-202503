			</header>
			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="487"/>This appendix is a collection of notes on the capabilities, limitations, and
prerequisites of the major import and export formats that Inkscape supports.</p>
			<p>
				You need to download and install external software if you want Inkscape to import certain formats.
As a rule, if you don't have the necessary external software
installed (or if it is not in <code>PATH</code>), Inkscape simply omits this
format from the list of supported formats in the <span class="ui">Open</span> or <span class="ui">Import</span>
dialogs.</p>
			<p>
				If Inkscape doesn’t support your favorite vector format, check whether an open source utility exists that can bridge the gap
between that format and one of the known formats
(ideally SVG, but PDF would work too). If such a converter exists, adding support for a new
format to Inkscape is a matter of writing an input or output extension (<a href="c19.xhtml#ch19">Chapter 19</a>).</p>
			<a id="sectionB.1"/><h2>B.1 Save vs. Export</h2>
			<p>
				A note on terminology: Inkscape uses the term <em>export</em> only for the<span class="ui">Export PNG Image</span> dialog (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.6.1">18.6.1</a>). The 
vector formats it supports, including the default Inkscape SVG format, are listed in the <span class="ui">Save as type</span>
list in the <span class="ui">Save</span>, <span class="ui">Save As</span>, and <span class="ui">Save a Copy</span> dialogs. In other words,
you don't <em>export</em> to these formats, you <em>save</em> <a id="488"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_488" title="488"/>to them. Since all
vector formats except Inkscape SVG lose some editability features or even drop some
classes of objects, saving in such a format and then trying to close the document
displays a warning, as shown in <a href="#figB-1">Figure B-1</a>.</p>
			<a id="figB-1"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="app/app-warn.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure B-1: Careful! You are closing a document last saved as something other than Inkscape SVG!</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				If you make any changes after saving a non-SVG file, you may have to <span class="ui">Save As</span>
the original SVG file again. To avoid this annoyance, use the <span class="ui"><strong>Save a Copy</strong></span> command
(Shift-Ctrl-Alt-S) for saving to a non-SVG format.
After saving a copy, the opened document remains associated with the original SVG file, and any further
changes are saved to it.</p>
			<a id="sectionB.2"/><h2>B.2 SVG Variants</h2>
			<p>
				Inkscape uses the <em>Inkscape SVG</em> vector format. As explained in <a href="c01.xhtml#section1.4">1.4</a>, this format is standard-compliant SVG
with some Inkscape-specific extensions that affect only whether you can edit various object types in Inkscape.
These extensions never change those object types’ appearance. 
It does not make much sense to save as <em>Plain SVG</em> except for a (modest) file size gain
or when you encounter some buggy software having problems
with Inkscape SVG. Both SVG flavors have <em>compressed</em> varieties (using the
.svgz filename extension), which produce much smaller non-human-readable files but are
otherwise the same and should be understood by most SVG software.</p>
			<p>You can open SVG files exported from Adobe Illustrator as usual.
These files usually contain a lot of AI-specific elements, which are useless
for Inkscape but blow up the size of the SVG file. Inkscape has
an import filter that removes the AI-specific binary chunks and converts
AI layers into Inkscape layers; to trigger it, the SVG file needs to have a
filename extension of .ai.svg instead of simply
.svg.</p>
			<a id="sectionB.3"/><h2>B.3 PDF</h2>
			<p>
				After SVG, PDF is the most powerful and widely recognized vector format that Inkscape supports
(<a href="c01.xhtml#section1.5.1.1">1.5.1.1</a>). While Inkscape is not the best tool for <em>roundtrip</em> PDF editing
(that is, opening a PDF, editing its content, and saving back as PDF), PDF is by far the best option for
connecting Inkscape with software that does not support SVG. Inkscape supports most of the latest versions of PDF’s static features
(shapes, text, images, gradients, opacity, meshes) but not PDF’s interactive features (such as forms).</p>
			<a id="sectionB.3.1"/><h3>
				B.3.1 <a id="489"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_489" title="489"/>Import</h3>
			<p>
				The biggest stumbling block is that PDF supports multiple pages in a document, while SVG does not. The first thing you see in the PDF import dialog (<a href="#figB-2">Figure B-2</a>) is therefore a page selector. The dialog shows you a preview of the selected page before you click <span class="ui">OK</span> to import it.</p>
				<a id="figB-2"/>
				<figure>
				<img alt="" src="app/app-pdfimport.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure B-2: PDF import dialog when opening or importing a PDF file</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				You can also clip (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.3">18.3</a>) the imported artwork to the various
boxes that may be defined in the PDF document. For example, clipping to the<em>media box</em> (that is, the page size) hides any objects that the PDF might
contain outside the page area; most PDF viewers won't show them
anyway, but Inkscape allows you to discover them.</p>
			<p>
				Inkscape's PDF import comes in two types: <em>Poppler/Cairo</em> and <em>Internal</em> import. 
The import dialog claims that the Poppler/Cairo import is done "via an external library,"
but that is misleading; Inkscape users don’t need to install anything external for either of these import types.
Which type to choose depends on its features and the different ways it treats text in PDF.</p>
			<a id="sectionB.3.1.1"/><h4>B.3.1.1 Text and Fonts</h4>
			<p>
				A PDF file can—and usually does—have its own fonts embedded into it; SVG does not (see <a href="c15.xhtml#section15.8">15.8</a> for the backstory). Inkscape can deal with this limitation in two different ways.</p>
			<p><a id="490"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_490" title="490"/>If you mostly care about how your document looks, choose the <span class="ui"><strong>Poppler/Cairo import</strong></span> option (<a href="#figB-3">Figure B-3</a>, left). With it, each text character becomes a symbol (<a href="c16.xhtml#section16.7">16.7</a>)  that you can unlink (<a href="c16.xhtml#section16.5">16.5</a>)  to convert to an editable path. This option fully preserves the appearance but, obviously, the text is no longer editable as text.</p>
			<p>
				In contrast, <span class="ui">Internal import</span> preserves text as text—but it will look correct only if you have the corresponding font installed in the system (<a href="#figB-3">Figure B-3</a>, right). For example, if a PDF file uses the font FancyShmancy for text, you don't need to care (or even know) when you just view that PDF file in Adobe Acrobat Reader or another PDF viewer, because the font is embedded into the file and the PDF viewer uses it. However, if you want to import that file into Inkscape using the <span class="ui">Internal import</span> option, you need to get the FancyShmancy font somewhere and install it on your computer before attempting the import. Without that, the FancyShmancy text will look all wrong.</p>
				<a id="figB-3"/>
				<figure>
				<img alt="" src="app/app-pdfimport-compare.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure B-3: A PDF page of this book imported with Poppler/Cairo (left) and with the internal importer but
without the main text font installed on the computer (right)</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Even if you do have the exact font that the PDF document uses, editing texts in an imported file is not very natural. A paragraph of PDF text is never converted into a single text object with automatic line wrap. Instead, each line becomes a text object of its own. Often, it is even worse than that: you will see lines broken into text-object fragments at seemingly random points (as the right side of  shows). This happens because PDF is fundamentally a visual format that doesn't provide any higher-level logical structures—even as simple as paragraphs.</p>
			<p>
				Inkscape offers the <span class="ui">Replace PDF fonts by closest-named installed fonts</span> option that may help with this issue. With it, if you don't have the FancyShmancy font installed but have FancyPancy, Inkscape will use that font, which may even work if that font is a close enough replica.</p>
			<p>
				An additional complication is that most PDFs refer to the fonts they
use by their <em>PostScript names</em>, which may differ from
the names of fonts your operating system shows. For example, a PDF may
refer to a font called <code>AlbertusMT-Light</code>, whereas the
same font in your Inkscape font list is called <code>Albertus MT
Lt</code>. Inkscape does its best to convert PostScript names
to regular names, but it can do that only for the fonts you have
installed—and even then it sometimes fails and chooses the wrong
installed font.</p>
			<p><a id="491"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_491" title="491"/>You
can always look up the original PostScript name of any text object’s font in 
an imported PDF by looking at its style in the <span class="ui">Selectors and CSS</span>
dialog (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.1">8.1</a>). The property you need is<code>-inkscape-font-specification</code>. For example, that property may
contain <code>AlbertusMT-Light</code>, whereas the standard <code>font-family</code> property is <code>Albertus MT Lt</code>.</p>
			<a id="sectionB.3.1.2"/><h4>B.3.1.2 Meshes</h4>
			<p>
				Like SVG, PDF supports mesh gradients (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.7">10.7</a>). However, Inkscape does not attempt to translate PDF meshes into SVG meshes;
instead, it approximates them with grids of flat-color tiles. At the bottom of the dialog (<a href="#figB-2">Figure B-2</a>), you can select how
precise you want this approximation to be, from <span class="ui">rough</span> to <span class="ui">very fine</span>. Typically, you’d need to experiment
to figure out the best value for your mesh-using PDF file, but the dialog will warn you that requesting too high a
precision will make your file too big and slow to work with.</p>

			<a id="sectionB.3.2"/>
			<h3>B.3.2 Export</h3>
			<p>
				As mentioned, Inkscape does not have a separate "Export" command for vector
formats; instead, go to <span class="ui"><strong>File<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Save As</strong></span> or <span class="ui"><strong>File<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Save a Copy</strong></span> and
choose the PDF format in the <span class="ui"><strong>Save as type</strong></span> list. After you type the
filename and click <span class="ui"><strong>OK</strong></span>, you will be presented with a dialog for
setting PDF export options (<a href="#figB-4">Figure B-4</a>).</p>
			<a id="figB-4"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="app/app-pdfexport.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure B-4: PDF export options</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>You can export PDF version 1.4 or 1.5.
For the fonts your document uses, you can either embed them into the PDF or convert all text objects to paths on export.</p>
			<p><a id="492"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_492" title="492"/>Filters (<a href="c17.xhtml#ch17">Chapter 17</a>) are SVG features that have no counterpart in
PDF. You have the option of converting any filtered
objects to bitmaps on export (<span class="ui">Rasterize filter effects</span>). If
you uncheck this, filters will be simply ignored (for example, any blurred
object will lose blur). Rasterization 
inflates the file size and loses the vector editability of the
objects affected, but it preserves the objects’ filtered appearance.
The <span class="ui">Resolution for rasterization</span> parameter can be the default 96 dpi for PDFs
intended for viewing onscreen, but it needs to be at least 300 dpi for PDFs intended for print.</p>
			<p>
				By default, the entire document is exported to PDF, but you can limit your export
to a single element by entering its ID (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.1">4.1</a>).
For example, in a file with several logos, you can export each logo to its own PDF file using this option.
The PDF’s page size is, by default, the same as that of your SVG, so any objects outside the page are
hidden (but still present in the PDF code); with <span class="ui">Output page size</span> set to <span class="ui">Use exported object's size</span>,
the PDF page will be as big as the bounding box of the object you're exporting.</p>
			<a id="sectionB.4"/><h2>B.4 PostScript and EPS</h2>
			<p>
				A couple decades ago, PostScript was <em>the</em> exchange format for vector data. Now 
it has largely ceded its position to PDF, which is much richer and better supported by all kinds of software.
If you have the choice, you should use PDF instead of PostScript. However, a lot of old projects and
clipart exist as PostScript files, and you still may need to deal with them.</p>
			<p>EPS is PostScript with some additional limitations that allow you to import and insert it into other
documents. An EPS file is always a single page, always has all fonts and bitmap images embedded (regular PS
files are not obliged to embed anything), and its page size is always clipped to its contents.</p>
			<a id="sectionB.4.1"/><h3>B.4.1 Import</h3>
			<p>
				To import PS and EPS, you need to install the Ghostscript interpreter that Inkscape runs automatically.
Ghostscript converts PS or EPS files to PDF format, which are then fed into Inkscape.
Versions for all major operating systems are available at <a href="https://www.ghostscript.com/">https://www.ghostscript.com/</a>. 
Make sure the ps2pdf (on Linux) or
ps2pdf.bat (on Windows) file of Ghostscript is in your <code>PATH</code>.</p>
			<p>
				Because PS and EPS files end up as PDF imports from Inkscape’s viewpoint, 
you will see the same PDF import dialog (<a href="#figB-2">Figure B-2</a>). In particular, if a PS file contains more than one page,
this dialog will allow you to choose which page
to import.</p>
			<a id="sectionB.4.2"/><h3>B.4.2 Export</h3>
			<p>
				Inkscape supports PS and EPS export natively. The dialog has
many of the same options as the PDF export dialog, as shown in <a href="#figB-5">Figure B-5</a>.</p>
			<a id="figB-5"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="app/app-psexport.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure B-5: PS or EPS export options</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="493"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_493" title="493"/>You can choose the <span class="ui">level</span> (that is, version) of PostScript; most modern software and printers support Level 3.
Just as in PDF export, fonts are either embedded
or converted to paths, and filters can be rasterized. Objects with nonzero opacity are also rasterized
(you cannot suppress it), because unlike PDF, PostScript does not support vector transparency.</p>
			<a id="sectionB.5"/><h2>B.5 AI</h2>
			<p>
				Up to version 8, Adobe Illustrator's (AI's) native format was based on PostScript
(<a href="c01.xhtml#section1.5.1.1">1.5.1.1</a>). It was not fully standard PostScript, however, and importing it into other
software has always been a pain. Various scripts on the web claim
to convert this old AI format into something more tractable, but they are all rather
limited and unreliable. While you can try using them, Inkscape doesn’t officially 
support import or export of the old AI format.</p>
			<p>
				Starting with version 9, Adobe switched to PDF for the base of its new Illustrator
format. While the AI files saved by Illustrator contain a lot of AI-specific
extensions, they are standard PDF that any PDF-capable software can open and
view. This is what Inkscape does: it treats any file with the
.ai extension as a PDF file and presents its standard <span class="ui">PDF Import Settings</span>
dialog to you (<a href="#sectionB.3">B.3</a>). On import, Inkscape loses the AI-specific metadata (such as
layers), but at least you get your vector objects as vectors.</p>
			<p>There's no support for AI export in Inkscape because recent
versions of Adobe Illustrator can import SVG and PDF files without
problems.</p>
			<a id="sectionB.6"/><h2>B.6 CorelDRAW</h2>
			<p>Inkscape can import various kinds of files created by the CorelDRAW vector editor (with the extensions .cdr,
.cdt, .ccx, and .cmx) natively. Export to CorelDRAW is not supported.</p>
			<a id="sectionB.7"/><h2>
				B.7 <a id="494"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_494" title="494"/>WMF, EMF, and EMF+</h2>
			<p>WMF (Windows MetaFile), EMF (Enhanced MetaFile), and EMF+ (Enhanced MetaFile Plus) are Windows-specific vector
formats used by some Windows-only software (such as Microsoft Office) for data
exchange and vector clipart. Of these, EMF is the most capable and widely supported, so it’s generally
preferable (if you have a choice). Inkscape supports these formats for import and export
natively.</p>
			<a id="sectionB.8"/><h2>B.8 XAML</h2>
			<p>Inkscape can both import and export the XAML (Extensible Application
Markup Language) format used by Microsoft in its .NET and Silverlight technologies. No
additional software is needed.</p>
			<a id="sectionB.9"/><h2>B.9 WPG</h2>
			<p>WPG (WordPerfect Graphics) is an old vector format that the WordPerfect text processor used; collections of clipart in this
format still exist. Inkscape imports WPG natively (no external software is needed).</p>
			<a id="sectionB.10"/><h2>B.10 VSD</h2>
			<p>VSD is the native format of Microsoft Visio. Inkscape has limited native support for VSD file import.</p>
			<a id="sectionB.11"/>
			<h2>B.11 DXF and HPGL (Export)</h2>
			<p>DXF (Drawing Exchange Format) is a common CAD (Computer-Aided Design) format used for
plans and technical drawings in software such as AutoCAD. HPGL is a vector
format used by some Hewlett-Packard plotters. Inkscape has limited support for
importing from and exporting to these formats.</p>
			<a id="sectionB.12"/><h2>B.12 ODG</h2>
			<p>OpenDocument Graphics (ODG) is the format used by, among others, the
OpenOffice and LibreOffice suites. Inkscape has limited 
support for ODG export; with recent versions of the office suites, it's better to use SVG for graphics exchange.</p>
			<a id="sectionB.13"/><h2>B.13 POV</h2>
			<p>
				POVRay (<a href="http://povray.org/">http://povray.org/</a>) is a popular open source 3D raytracer, not a
vector application. However, Inkscape can export the paths and shapes as 3D scenes that POVRay will then render; you can manually edit the
text-based .pov file to adjust angles, cameras, lighting, and so on.</p>
			<a id="sectionB.14"/><h2>
				B.14 <a id="495"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_495" title="495"/>LaTeX (Export)</h2>
			<p>
				LaTeX is an old and powerful open source document formatting system.
Inkscape can output its drawings directly into a LaTeX document. You will need
the PSTricks package (<a href="http://tug.org/PSTricks/">http://tug.org/PSTricks/</a>) installed in your LaTeX system to render that file.</p>
			<a id="sectionB.15"/><h2>B.15 Bitmap Formats (Import/Export)</h2>
			<p>
				As we saw in <a href="c18.xhtml#section18.6">18.6</a>, Inkscape can export to PNG, JPG, TIFF, and WebP formats natively. It has built-in import support for a lot more bitmap
formats, including all the major ones (PNG, JPG, TIFF, GIF, and others).</p>
			<p>
				The GIMP bitmap editor uses the XCF format. Inkscape can export to this format via an extension, preserving the layers 
(that is, layers in the SVG file become layers in the XCF file). You need to have GIMP installed and in <code>PATH</code> for this extension to work.</p>
			<a id="sectionB.16"/><h2>B.16 Printing</h2>
			<p>
				You can think of printing of as exporting—if only
because, to print a document, Inkscape exports it to the format that the
printer understands. Depending on the printer driver, this is likely either PostScript or
PDF, not SVG. If you select
the <span class="ui">Print to file</span> option from the <span class="ui">Print</span> dialog, you will get a PS or PDF file that looks exactly as
if you saved your document with this file type.</p>
			<p>
				I'm not going to describe the <span class="ui">Print</span> dialog that you get when you select <span class="ui">File<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Print</span> (Ctrl-P) because
it is created by your operating system, not by Inkscape, and its options—paper size, margins, print quality,
and so on—reflect your printer's capabilities. The only thing
Inkscape adds to this dialog is the <span class="ui">Rendering</span> tab.</p>
			<p>
				By default, Inkscape prints by exporting the document to a vector format (PostScript or
PDF). As explained earlier, Inkscape is smart enough to rasterize those objects using the
features these formats don't support: filters and meshes (both PS and PDF) and transparency (PS only). 
Alternatively,
you can render the entire document into bitmap by switching from <span class="ui">Vector</span> to<span class="ui">Bitmap</span> on the <span class="ui">Rendering</span> tab and setting the bitmap resolution. This
option is generally safer, as it avoids any kinds of surprises that format conversion
may hold, but it may result in large print files and slow printing.</p>

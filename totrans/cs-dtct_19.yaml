    anything suspicious. None of the recent transfer destinations were even remotely
    close to the capital, where most of the thefts had occurred. The nearest transfer
    had been to the city of Easterville—50 miles away—and the “Reason for Transfer”
    listed by the young officer’s captain had been “a persistent smell of feet.”

    about initial transfers?” asked Frank.

    into fists at her side, but her face clearly said that she would very much prefer
    to use one of them to punch Frank in the nose.

    a useful piece of information. Why didn’t you tell me?”

    Donovan unless they could open the conversation with “Great news!” or “You’ll
    never guess what we found.” Going into his office with an update consisting of
    equal parts dead ends, unexplored leads, and life-threatening situations invited
    a loud and colorful lecture. Frank wouldn’t even be considering it if he didn’t
    need information himself.

    “Parallelized search, remember?” He reached into his pocket and felt around but
    found only his notepad, a few food wrappers, and an old empty snail shell. The
    shell was a souvenir from his last case, a nasty affair involving a percussion
    band and numerous noise complaints. He pulled it from his pocket.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    her hands, she muttered, “Why does it have to be Billy? He’s always impossible
    to find.”

    expression. “Can you maintain the binary search tree on our way to the station?”
  prefs: []

    like lugging them halfway across the city. They look heavy.”

    nasty look.

- en: Fifty-seven minutes later, Frank and Socks stood outside the police records
    office. The trip usually took less than 20 minutes, but they were slowed significantly
    by the large glowing binary search tree floating in front of Socks. Not only did
    it block his vision, causing him to trip over numerous ruts, but it was also the
    cause of much rubbernecking and endless questions from curious pedestrians, until
    Frank resorted to yelling “Out of the way! Dangerously unstable magic here,” as
    they walked. The warning worked quite well.

    transferred to a station somewhere in the kingdom. As a result, the Ledger of
    Initial Assignments for the last 10 classes weighed at least 10 pounds. As with
    the other transfer ledgers, it was sorted by name rather than date.

    said as he found an empty desk in the paperwork common room. Due to the standard
    combination of security needs and high volumes of paperwork, no one was allowed
    to work in the records vault itself. Instead, all police stations included one
    or more workrooms immediately adjacent to the record room, containing nothing
    more than long wooden tables and individual study carrels.

    at the top, search downward as though you’re looking for the element and, when
    you hit a dead end, add the new entry below that node.
  prefs: []

    than the root node’s value of 55, we go to the right. Then we go left, because
    57 is less than 67\. Then we go left again, because 57 is less than 61\. Finally,
    comparing 57 to 59, we ought to go down to the left node again, but we can’t because
    there is no left child. So we add the new node as the left child of 59.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    search tree, the resulting tree might be unbalanced. Our search algorithm will
    still work, though.”
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Adding nodes to a tree could cancel out one of the major advantages of a balanced
    binary search tree: that it makes many algorithms efficient. Each time you approximately
    double the number of nodes in a balanced binary search tree, you only need to
    add a single level. This means that for a simple search, such as looking up an
    element, you can double the amount of data while adding only one more step to
    your search. However, Socks was correct: this efficiency applies only if the tree
    is balanced. In the worst case, the tree forms a long line that you’re forced
    to search along. And when you’re adding arbitrary values, there are no guarantees
    that the tree will remain balanced.'

- en: 'Adding nodes to a binary search tree is similar to searching for a target value.
    We start at the root of the tree and progress downward as though searching for
    the value to insert. We progress to the left or right depending on whether the
    new value we’re inserting is smaller or larger than the value at the current node.
    The descent ends when we reach a dead end: a node without a child in the correct
    direction. At this point, we can create a new node and make it the (left or right)
    child.'

- en: The cost of inserting a single element scales linearly with the depth of the
    tree. However, we have no guarantees that the tree will remain balanced as new
    nodes are inserted. In fact, it is easy for a tree to become unbalanced, with
    deep branches, depending on the order of insertions. For example, if we insert
    numbers in sorted order, all the additions can go down a single branch.

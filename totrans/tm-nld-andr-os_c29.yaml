- en: 'One of the ongoing debates on the team in those early times (and for years
    afterward) was: were they building a product or a platform? That is, were they
    trying to build one or more phones (products), or an operating system that would
    be usable across many different phones, from various manufacturers, now and in
    the future (a platform)?'

  zh: 在早期以及以后的多年时间里，团队内部一直在进行一个持续的辩论：他们是在建造一个产品还是一个平台？也就是说，他们是在尝试建造一个或多个手机（产品），还是一个可以跨多个制造商的多种手机使用的操作系统，现在和将来（一个平台）？
- en: It is clear now, especially given the breadth of the Android ecosystem, that
    Android is a platform. Yes, it runs on Google’s phones, including generations
    of Nexus phones and the more recent Pixel phones. It also runs on many more phones
    across the world, most of which have never been seen by anyone on the Android
    team, but all of which run Google apps and the Google Play Store as part of the
    Android ecosystem. But at the time, it wasn’t clear what the priorities should
    be. Since 1.0 was clearly targeting the G1 phone, the distinction between the
    two was muddied. Further complicating the debate was the fact that building a
    specific product is always going to be easier (and faster) than building a more
    flexible platform for the long term. So if Android’s main priority was just getting
    something to market, focusing on a product was the right call.

  zh: 现在显然很清楚，特别是考虑到Android生态系统的广泛覆盖，Android是一个平台。是的，它在谷歌的手机上运行，包括Nexus系列和更近期的Pixel手机。它也在全球许多其他手机上运行，其中大多数从未被Android团队中的任何人看到过，但所有这些设备都作为Android生态系统的一部分运行Google应用和Google
    Play商店。但当时，人们并不清楚应该优先考虑什么。由于1.0版本明显针对G1手机，两者之间的区别变得模糊起来。更加复杂化的辩论是，构建一个特定的产品总是比为长远打造更灵活的平台更容易（也更快）。因此，如果Android的主要优先事项仅仅是推出市场上的某些东西，专注于产品是正确的选择。
- en: Meanwhile, the iPhone took a very product-focused approach. As Bob Borchers
    (then Senior Director of Product Marketing for iPhone) said, “At that point, we
    weren’t really thinking of iOS as a platform.” In fact, the App Store wasn’t even
    part of the plan for that first device; the iPhone was just an Apple device with
    Apple apps. This approach enabled Apple to focus on getting the details for that
    specific product exactly right.

  zh: 与此同时，iPhone采取了非常注重产品的方法。正如当时的iPhone产品营销高级总监Bob Borchers所说：“那时候，我们并没有把iOS视为一个平台。”
    实际上，App Store甚至不是那款首个设备的计划的一部分；iPhone只是一个带有苹果应用的苹果设备。这种方法使得苹果能够专注于确保那款特定产品的每一个细节都准确无误。
- en: Apple has had many follow-on phones since then, and now has the App Store and
    a large developer ecosystem. But they always know exactly what products they are
    building for and can tune the OS and the platform they ship appropriately. Google
    has also shipped many phones . . . but that number is insignificant compared to
    the quantity and variety of devices shipped by other manufacturers. So it is far
    more important for Android to be portable to all of those devices than it is for
    it to be perfect for Google devices but difficult for OEMs to deal with.

  zh: 从那时起，苹果推出了许多后续手机，并且现在拥有了App Store和庞大的开发者生态系统。但他们始终清楚自己在为哪些产品而建造，并可以调整他们所发布的操作系统和平台。谷歌也推出了许多手机……但与其他制造商出货量和种类的设备相比，这个数字微不足道。因此，对Android来说，更重要的是能够适配所有这些设备，而不是在谷歌设备上完美运行，但难以处理OEMs。
- en: 'The product-versus-platform debates on the team were represented by the different
    companies that people came from: Danger, Be/PalmSource, and WebTV/Microsoft. The
    people from Danger preferred simpler solutions, which gave them more of a product

- en: Romain Guy said, “The folks that came from Palm worked on Palm OS 6, with compatibility
    for Palm OS 5\. They saw firsthand what would happen to an OS that was not built

- en: Brian Swetland saw both sides, having worked at both Be and Danger. “You need
    both. It was a lesson I took away from Be. Be would get in a rut on that at times—so
    focused on being the platform. If you don’t do real apps and you just build a
    pure platform, then you’re not closing the loop. You don’t build what people need.”

  zh: 布莱恩·斯威特兰德看到过两种观点，因为他曾在Be和Danger工作过。“你需要两者。这个是我从Be学到的教训。Be有时会陷入死胡同——过于专注于成为平台。如果你不做真正的应用，只是构建一个纯粹的平台，那么你就无法闭合这个循环。你没有做出人们需要的东西。”
- en: Brian said that the debate on the Android team continues. “I don’t think it
    ever became clear, to this day. This used to drive Andy batshit. We would have
    the all-hands meeting, and I or Dave Bort would ask what we were building. We
    were definitely building a platform and there were products in that platform.
    But were we building The Google Phone, a vertical thing, our product? Or were
    we building something we were expecting the OEMs to build phones on under their
    brand? Or something in between? Over the years, we did a bit of everything.

  zh: 布莱恩说，Android团队的辩论至今仍在继续。“我认为到现在也从未变得明确过。这曾经让安迪十分头疼。我们会召开全员会议，我或戴夫·博特会问我们到底在做什么。我们显然是在构建一个平台，而平台中有产品。但我们是在构建‘谷歌手机’，一个垂直的东西，我们的产品吗？还是我们在构建一个期待OEM厂商基于这个平台推出自己品牌的手机？或者是介于两者之间的某种东西？多年来，我们做了所有这些事情。”
- en: “The Nexus devices, and now the Pixel devices, feel much more vertical. But
    there’s this whole wide ecosystem where people do all kinds of crazy things. Then
    you have Amazon and Fire where they’re taking the platform as a starting point
    to build their own platform that’s derived from it but not the same.”

- en: Mike Cleron said that Dianne “had the clearest vision of ‘This is not just launch
    G1, live to fight another day.’ She was laying foundations for things that were
    over the horizon, certainly for me, probably for most people. Dianne in 2006–2007
    saw things that we wouldn’t need until 2013, and somehow engineered those into
    some of the foundational concepts of Android.”

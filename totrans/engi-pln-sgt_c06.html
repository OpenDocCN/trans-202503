<h2 id="h1-502321c06-0001">Introduction</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Like the air we breathe, it’s easy to take for granted that our lives practically revolve around water. Not only is water a physiological necessity, but it also serves as a source of power, a means of transportation for goods and passengers, and an excellent place for recreational activities. It serves as a habitat for a multitude of aquatic plants and animals as well. On the other hand, water can be destructive, creating floods that damage property and jeopardize public safety, and eroding riverbanks and shorelines. With its absolute necessity and ever-present threat, it’s no surprise that much of our infrastructure is devoted to controlling and managing water.</p>
<p>Many of the world’s largest and most complex projects were designed and constructed to either protect against or take advantage of the Earth’s immense resources of water. We’ve built enormous dams to create reservoirs that store freshwater, vast networks of waterways for maritime navigation, and gigantic flood control and coastal protection features around the world. Many of these facilities even attract enough attention and public interest to warrant their own tourism centers that provide a safe vantage for observation and opportunities to learn about their history and technical details. The next time you pass by a major dam, port, lock, or levee, stop by the visitor center, take a tour, and get the T-shirt!</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c06-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_133" title="133"/>Shore Protection Structures</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Coastlines may look static and unmoving on a map, but they are some of the most dynamic places in the world. Shores are subject to a vast array of natural disruptive forces, including wind, waves, tides, ocean currents, and storms. Humans also impact shorelines by dredging channels, building waterways, developing structures along the coast, and trapping sediment in upland reservoirs before it can reach the shore. It’s no wonder that our coastlines shift and transform over time. The soil and rock that make up the coastline are in constant flux, endlessly stolen from one place and deposited somewhere else.</p>
<p>The seashore is essential to humankind, and not just because of the pretty sunsets. Many of our largest cities sit along the coast because of the opportunity provided by shipping and fishing. In addition, beaches support local economies, providing millions of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity around the world through tourism. Shoreline erosion is a constant menace to our infrastructure, developed areas, and navigational waterways, threatening structures along the shore and the livelihood of vast portions of coastal populations. Much of coastal engineering focuses on ways we can protect the shoreline and combat the disruptive forces that cause it to change and disappear over time.</p>
<p>One of the most basic coastal structures is a <span class="SmallCaps">revetment</span>, a simple layer of hard armor atop a natural slope. Revetments usually feature large stones or concrete blocks that can withstand the constant force of crashing waves and tidal currents. Using blocks or stones can also absorb the energy of each wave, reducing the distance it travels up the slope. Similar to a revetment, a <span class="SmallCaps">seawall </span>is a vertical structure parallel to the shore, protecting upland areas against erosion. Seawalls are usually constructed using reinforced concrete. Many seawalls feature a shape called a <em>recurve</em> to redirect wave energy back toward the sea, reducing the likelihood of water crashing over the top. Seawalls are usually constructed to an elevation above the normal high tide to protect against flooding and storm surges. They typically separate the developed areas they protect above from the sandy beaches below.</p>
<p><span class="SmallCaps">Breakwaters</span> are another type of parallel structure used to protect areas of the shore from waves. Unlike revetments and seawalls, they aren’t connected to the shore. Instead, breakwaters are constructed offshore to dissipate wave energy and create areas of tranquil water for ships and structures along the coast, called <span class="SmallCaps">harbors</span>. Breakwaters can be made from many materials, but they are most commonly mounds of rock rubble. Often the <span class="SmallCaps">core</span> of the breakwater uses smaller rocks to reduce the flow of wave energy through the structure, while the outside layer consists of larger stones that can better withstand the waves.</p>
<p>Another protective structure, called a <span class="SmallCaps">groin</span>, protrudes into the sea to combat <em>longshore drift</em>, the process of sediment <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_134" title="134"/>movement parallel to the coast. Like breakwaters, groins are usually made using mounds of rock or rubble. Over time, a groin will trap sand suspended in ocean currents to create a beach (a process called <em>accretion</em>). If properly sized, a groin can also protect the area on the downdrift side by reducing the speed and power of ocean currents along the shore. However, an oversized groin will rob currents of all their sediment, leaving none to replenish the beaches beyond and thus accelerating erosion along unprotected shores. After one groin is built, additional groins are commonly needed to protect the downdrift area, eventually leading to saw-toothed beaches extending for great distances.</p>
<p>Similar to groins, <span class="SmallCaps">jetties</span> are structures constructed perpendicular to the coast. They are often built in pairs to protect the inlet to a navigation channel by extending its mouth into the sea. Not only do they block the passage of sediment into the channel, but they also confine the flow of seawater within during tide changes, speeding it up to flush sediment from the bottom and minimize its accumulation.</p>
<p>These hard armoring structures often provide a long-term solution to erosion, but they can also create unintended consequences. For just one example, smooth concrete seawalls reflect waves rather than absorb them, potentially worsening erosion farther down the shore. These structures can also affect the quality of habitat in the sea, creating environmental challenges. When possible, coastal engineers look toward “softer” solutions to erosion. One of those techniques involves planting or maintaining trees and shrubs that can grow in the tidal zones along coasts. These are called <span class="SmallCaps">mangrove forests</span>, and their dense networks of roots absorb wave energy and protect the soil along the coast.</p>
<p>Another soft solution to coastal erosion is to create <span class="SmallCaps">artificial reefs</span> that provide habitat for fish, corals, and other marine life. Many materials have been used to construct artificial reefs, including rocks, concrete, shipwrecks, and even submerged subway cars. These reefs offer surfaces where marine organisms can attach or hide, with a secondary benefit of dissipating wave energy offshore, serving as submerged breakwaters.</p>
<p>Yet another soft solution is to reverse the process of erosion by replacing the material that has been lost, a technique commonly known as <span class="SmallCaps">beach nourishment</span>. Beaches are not only essential recreation areas and economic drivers, but they also serve as buffers between development and the sea. They dissipate the energy from storms and waves before it can reach developed areas, but sand can be moved downdrift or pulled out into deeper waters in the process. Replenishing lost sand protects coastal structures and creates spaces for recreation. Nourishment is often accomplished by borrowing sediments from the seafloor with a <span class="SmallCaps">dredge</span> and pumping them back to the shore as a <em>slurry</em> of water and sand in a pipeline. The slurry is discharged ashore into a large basin to allow the water to drain and sand to settle out, after which it can be spread along the beach using earth-moving equipment. Beach <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_135" title="135"/>nourishment has environmental impacts, and it’s not a permanent solution, but it is a popular tool for addressing coastal erosion.</p>
<p>Finally, sometimes the cheapest option to protect shoreline development from damage is for it not to exist in the first place. This strategy, often called <em>retreat</em>, involves purchasing and condemning property or relocating buildings and infrastructure farther from the shore. In some cases, the best engineering is to let nature do what it does best: allowing the coastline to be vibrant and dynamic, which is what draws humans to it in the first place.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Boulders are a cost-effective way to armor the coastline against the destructive power of seawater, wind, and waves. However, not every part of the shore has a nearby quarry that can provide rocks in such quantity as required for coastal structures. Another option for creating revetments and breakwaters is to use cast concrete blocks, often known as <em>armor units</em>. These unique structures are formed in geometric shapes, allowing them to entangle and interlock to resist powerful hydrodynamic forces. A wide variety of concrete armor unit shapes exist. These blocks are often easier to transport and place than unwieldy boulders because they are consistent in size, shape, and weight. They can also be manufactured closer to a project site, reducing transportation costs (especially in areas with no rock quarry nearby). </p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c06-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_137" title="137"/>Ports</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Maritime transportation is an essential part of modern life. People don’t travel long distances by boat as much nowadays due to lack of speed, but <em>shipping</em> got its name for a reason. We still use ships to move vast quantities of cargo around the world every day, maintaining complex supply chains of raw materials to finished goods. Waterway transportation persists because ships are efficient. Even the most massive of consignments are practically effortless to move once floating on water. Moving one ton of goods the same distance on a boat takes roughly half the amount of energy that it would by train and approximately a fifth of the energy it would take on a truck. In addition, shipping is the primary way goods can move across portions of the globe that aren’t connected by land.</p>
<p><em>Ports</em> are the hubs that connect maritime and overland modes of transportation. In the simplest terms, a port is a place where a ship can dock, but that straightforward function belies the enormous complexity of modern maritime facilities. Ports are found not only in cities along the coast but also in cities along rivers and inland waterways. They usually consist of multiple <em>terminals</em> where loading and unloading of goods—or people, in the case of cruise ships—take place. Each terminal is engineered to move a specific type of goods on and off ships quickly and efficiently. <em>Bulk carriers</em>, which transport unpackaged cargo like grains and ore, are serviced using large conveyors or bucket cranes. <em>Tankers</em>, which carry liquids like oil, are filled and drained by massive hoses. Most cargo ships that move packaged goods use <span class="SmallCaps">containers</span>, standardized steel boxes that can be easily transferred between trains, trucks, and other vessels using cranes.</p>
<p>A container terminal is one of the most recognizable parts of a commercial shipping port with its gigantic cranes and colorful stacks of steel boxes. The enormous <span class="SmallCaps">ship-to-shore cranes</span> usually sit atop rails so they can traverse the length of a cargo ship, loading or unloading containers as quickly as one every two minutes.</p>
<p>Sometimes containers are moved directly between modes of travel (mainly truck, train, or another ship), but often they must be stored in the <span class="SmallCaps">yard</span> before their onward vehicle arrives. Containerization of cargo creates a puzzle since only the top container in each stack is accessible. Getting to the bottom of the stack requires relocating everything above. Computerized management systems optimize the placement of each container to reduce the number of movements it takes to deliver them to their destinations.</p>
<p>A wide variety of vehicles are used to handle and move containers within the terminal, and their control is increasingly being automated in modern ports. <span class="SmallCaps">Terminal tractors</span> (known by many names, including <em>hustlers</em>) are small semi-trucks that carry containers around the yard. <span class="SmallCaps">Automated guided vehicles</span> perform <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_138" title="138"/>the same function but without the human driver. <span class="SmallCaps">Reach stackers</span> and <span class="SmallCaps">straddle carriers</span> can transport and lift containers to and from the top of a stack. <span class="SmallCaps">Gantry cranes</span> ride over long rows of stacked containers. Instead of hooks, these vehicles all use a device called a <em>spreader</em> to lift each container. Every box is equipped with reinforced <span class="SmallCaps">corner castings</span>. Four <span class="SmallCaps">twist locks</span> engage into oval-shaped holes in each casting. The twist locks rotate 90 degrees, securely connecting the spreader to the container. Ingenious in their simplicity, twist lock mechanisms are installed on ship decks, trucks, and trains, and between each container in a stack. They are responsible for locking millions of hulking steel boxes into place each day.</p>
<p>Although maritime terminology varies regionally and worldwide, the structure that serves as the edge of the terminal is usually called a <em>wharf</em> or <em>quay</em>. The wharf may include one or more <em>berths</em>, which are parking spots for ships. Each berth includes several large <span class="SmallCaps">bollards</span> to which the ship’s <span class="SmallCaps">mooring lines</span> are attached. <em>Winches</em> on the ship keep these lines taut to minimize movement during loading and unloading. In addition,<span class="SmallCaps"> fenders</span> along each berth serve as cushions to protect both the wharf and the vessel’s hull from damage. Traditionally, old tires were used as fenders, but modern ports use devices specifically designed for the types and sizes of ships serviced.</p>
<p>One of the most critical decisions in the design of a port facility is the largest ship that can be accommodated, called the <em>design vessel</em>. Accommodating larger ships makes port facilities more expensive to construct and maintain, but it can bring more traffic and more revenue, so it’s a careful balance. The design vessel length determines the length of each berth and the overall size of the harbor. Its <span class="SmallCaps">beam</span> affects the size of the <span class="SmallCaps">booms</span> on the ship-to-shore cranes used to load and unload, and its <span class="SmallCaps">draft</span> determines the minimum depth of the harbor below. This depth is maintained by dredging sediment from the waterway floor using excavators or suction pipes. Designers of ships (called <em>naval architects</em>) try to make them as large as possible while still fitting into the canals, locks, and ports they will encounter. In fact, many ship types are named for the facility into which they will barely fit; for example, Suezmax ships are the largest vessels capable of transiting the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>Wharves must be robust structures, capable of withstanding wind, waves, tides, currents, and the extreme forces of ships’ mooring lines day in, day out. In addition, they must be quite tall to allow enormous ships to dock directly alongside. Many wharves are built on <span class="SmallCaps">fill</span>, soil brought to the site and compacted in place to serve as a firm foundation. A <span class="SmallCaps">retaining wall</span> reinforces the fill while allowing ships access to the edge. When site geology isn’t ideal for supporting the weight of port equipment and cargo, a wharf may be supported on <span class="SmallCaps">piles</span>. These vertical steel or concrete elements are drilled or driven deep into the underlying soil to keep the wharf from settling or shifting over time.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_139" title="139"/>Waterways use many navigation aids to help mariners safely steer their ships. Floating devices, called <span class="SmallCaps">buoys</span>, delineate navigable waterways and hazards. Just like road signs, they use standardized colors and symbols to communicate rules and information. They are usually held in place with a chain and anchor. The chain has enough slack to absorb shock loads from waves, wind, and current and accommodate changes in level from tides. The anchor can be a heavy weight, called a <span class="SmallCaps">sinker</span>, or a device driven or drilled into the underlying soil.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">For much of history, it was common for overloaded ships to succumb to high waves and sink. Without regulations, captains were incentivized to carry as much cargo as they thought the vessel could hold, frequently overestimating to the demise of their goods and crews. Over time, insurance companies and the international shipping community formalized requirements for marking the legal load limit on the outside of every ship. This load line, usually denoted as a horizontal line through a circle, will fall below the water if the vessel is overloaded. It is often known as the <em>Plimsoll</em><em> line</em> after the British politician who championed its use. The buoyancy of a ship depends on the temperature of the water and whether it’s in seawater or freshwater, so most modern ships have a set of marks that serve as the load line in the various conditions through which they may travel.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c06-0004"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_141" title="141"/>Locks</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Shipping by waterway has its limitations, namely that not every place is accessible by boat. We’ve overcome this obstacle somewhat using constructed waterways or canals. The earliest works of written history describe canals and shipping. Even thousands of years ago, humans sought to bring access by boat to areas otherwise inaccessible. Another limitation is more difficult to surmount, however. Water is self-leveling. Unlike roads or rail, you can’t lay water on a slope to get up or down a hill. An ideal canal would sit at the same level for its entire length, but in areas with steep terrain, that would require so much excavation that it would be practically impossible. Rather than cut massive canyons to keep canals at a consistent elevation, we move ships up or down to different levels like steps on a staircase using navigation <em>locks</em>.</p>
<p>A lock consists of a watertight <span class="SmallCaps">chamber</span> with large gates at either end. The way a lock works is quite simple. A ship going up enters the mostly empty chamber, and the <span class="SmallCaps">lower gate</span> is closed. Then water from above is allowed to fill the space, raising the vessel. Once the level in the lock reaches that of the upper canal, the <span class="SmallCaps">upper gate</span> can be fully opened, and the ship can continue on its way. Going down follows the same steps, but in reverse. A ship enters the filled chamber, the upper gate is closed, and the water in the lock is allowed to drain. Once the level in the chamber matches that of the lower canal, the lower gate can be fully opened, and the ship can continue onward. It’s an entirely reversible lift system that, in its simplest form, requires no external source of power to work, except for the water itself.</p>
<p>Locks on rivers may be combined with a dam that impounds water and discharges floodwaters when needed. Most modern locks that accommodate large ships are built from reinforced concrete. They have walls and a floor, just like a gigantic bathtub. The approaches to the lock are designed to be straight with no crosscurrents so ships can easily line up to enter the chamber. Small locks used for recreational boats can often be self-operated, but large locks on busy waterways have operations staff to lift and lower ships 24 hours per day.</p>
<p>The gates on each side of the <span class="SmallCaps">lock chamber</span> are engineering marvels themselves. Most locks use <span class="SmallCaps">miter gates</span>. They are composed of two leaves, like enormous, hinged doors that close toward the center. Instead of closing in a straight line, the leaves meet at an angle pointing upstream. Pressure from the water above forces the gates tightly closed, keeping them sealed and leak-free during the operation of the lock. In some places, particularly those affected by tides, it is possible for the downstream level to rise above that in the upper canal. In such a situation, miter gates would not function properly. <span class="SmallCaps">Sector gates</span> provide an alternative to miter gates that can handle water pressure from both directions. Sector gates are shaped like <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_142" title="142"/>slices of pie that hinge at their points and meet in the center. Some modern locks employ gates that roll open and closed instead of using hinges. <span class="SmallCaps">Rolling gates</span> benefit from sliding into a recess that can be pumped dry for maintenance and repairs (rather than needing to remove each gate entirely).</p>
<p>In all locks, the lower gate is the real workhorse. The upper gate must only be tall enough to allow ships to enter the chamber when filled. The lower gate must hold back water from the very top to the bottom of the chamber. Water pressure increases with depth, so locks with a significant <span class="SmallCaps">rise</span> require the lower gate to withstand extreme forces. When a canal needs to ascend a substantial elevation difference, multiple smaller locks in series (called a <em>flight</em>) are used rather than a single large lock.</p>
<p>The plumbing required to fill and empty a lock chamber is another essential part of its engineering. Many locks are choke points to waterway traffic, so operators try to minimize the time it takes a ship to get through. Imagine the challenge of filling and draining a gigantic swimming pool 30 or more times per day while people are in the pool. Similarly, you can’t just open the upper gate and let the water flow in. For one, the difference in water levels creates so much pressure that opening the gate is practically impossible. More important, the in- or outrush of water would endanger ships transiting through the lock. Instead, most locks use a separate system to fill and drain the chamber. The simplest option is to have a smaller shutter, sometimes called a <em>paddle</em>, in each gate that can be opened and closed. Large locks use <span class="SmallCaps">culverts</span> to move water through <span class="SmallCaps">ports</span> in the sides or bottom of the chamber. Two <span class="SmallCaps">valves</span> control the flow. The lock is filled by opening the valve at the upper gate, and the chamber is drained by opening the one at the lower gate.  The ports are carefully designed to move as much water as possible without creating dangerous turbulence, jets, or swells within the chamber that could capsize a ship.</p>
<p>Even with a well-designed filling system, a lock chamber can be a turbulent space. Ships need to be moored in place to avoid collisions with the gates or walls. However, mooring lines can’t be attached to the tops of the lock walls. For a ship moving up, they would immediately become slack. For a ship moving down, they could pull the vessel right out of the water! Smaller locks require the boat pilot to take in or pay out the lines as the water level rises or falls. Larger locks use <span class="SmallCaps">floating bitts</span> that ride along vertical guides to keep moored vessels in place as they ascend or descend. </p>

<figure class="graphic"><img alt="" class="" src="image_fi/502321c06/g06007.png"/></figure>
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Even though boats can move through locks in both directions, water moves through in only one. Each time the lock is operated, you lose a “lockful” of water downstream. Canals aren’t always full of limitless water, and operating locks day in, day out can mean losing millions of liters of water per day. Some facilities use <em>water</em><em>-</em><em>saving basins</em>, also called <em>side ponds</em>, to reduce the loss of water through the locks. The lock chamber drains into the nearby basin rather than releasing the water downstream when lowering a ship. When the time comes to fill the lock, water from the basin is used first to raise the level as far as possible. The remainder of the chamber is supplied from the upper canal.</p>
<p>Without large pumps, the water savings are limited by gravity. A side pond must sit at an elevation between the top and bottom of the lock chamber so water can flow both into and out of it, meaning only around a third of the water can be recycled. However, the savings can be increased with the size and number of basins. For example, the newest locks at the Panama Canal have three basins each, allowing them to use only about 40 percent of the water that would otherwise be required.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c06-0005"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_145" title="145"/>Levees and Floodwalls</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Every year floods impact populated areas, costing lives and millions of dollars in damages, devastating communities, and grinding local economies to a halt. If you’ve ever experienced one yourself, you know how powerless it feels to be up against Mother Nature. We can’t change how much it rains, but we have developed ways to manage that water once it reaches the land to limit the danger it poses to lives and property. </p>
<p>Flooding on rivers is particularly challenging to manage because its impacts aren’t linear. In the <span class="SmallCaps">main channel</span>, where normal river flows occur, a rise in water level creates only a slight increase in the area of inundation. The steep <span class="SmallCaps">banks</span> contain the flow. However, the topography is often wide and flat above the channel banks, ideal for farmland and urban development. When the river’s flow overtops the banks, even small increases in water level can create broad areas of inundation. These areas just above the riverbanks are often called <span class="SmallCaps">floodplains</span> because they are so vulnerable to overbanking flows. One structural solution to riverine flooding is to increase the height of the banks to constrain the flow of water away from developed areas.</p>
<p>The most common way to raise the banks of a river is simply to gather nearby soil and pile it into an embankment. These structures, called <span class="SmallCaps">levees</span> or <em>dikes</em>, have been used for centuries to divert and impound water. They are also used along coastal areas to protect against storm surge. Although simple in concept, modern levees rely on advanced engineering to protect low-lying areas from floods. After all, soil is not the strongest of building materials, especially when faced with fast-moving water. Engineers specify the <span class="SmallCaps">slopes</span> and compaction requirements of the levee based on the properties of the soil available for construction.</p>
<p>Rapid flows during floods can create erosion and damage the river side of a levee. The slopes are often planted with grass as the dense root systems protect against erosion. Levees subject to longer-duration floods or high waves may include stone or concrete armoring, called <span class="SmallCaps">revetments</span>, for additional protection. Because earthen embankments can deteriorate over time, maintenance is vital. Levees must be kept free of trees and woody vegetation that can be toppled or ripped out during a flood. Burrowing animals must also be discouraged from making a home in levees because their holes can create paths for water to seep through the soil structure.</p>
<p>Although relatively inexpensive and straightforward, levees take up a significant amount of land due to their trapezoidal shape. A more expensive but space-saving alternative is to build a <span class="SmallCaps">floodwall</span>. These walls are typically made from reinforced concrete and serve the same purpose of raising the banks of a river to keep the flow contained. They are also less susceptible to long-term deterioration because they are built from more resilient materials than compacted soil.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_146" title="146"/>The height of a levee or floodwall is a critical decision. The potential magnitude of flooding is almost limitless. If you can imagine a big storm, you can probably imagine a bigger one, which means flood infrastructure must strike a balance between cost to build and the amount of protection it provides. In the United States, many levees and floodwalls are designed to guard against the <em>100-year flood</em>, a somewhat confusing term for a simple concept. Because we have extensive historical records of rainfall worldwide, we can estimate the relationship between any storm’s severity and its probability of occurring. The 100-year flood is a reference point on that line: a theoretical storm that has a 1 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in a given year at a certain location. Although its name implies that it happens only once every hundred years, the 1 percent annual chance equates to a 26 percent chance of such a storm occurring within a 30-year window. Over 50 years, that probability approaches 40 percent, nearly the flip of a coin. </p>
<p>Designing to the 100-year flood is our way of recognizing that it isn’t cost-effective to protect against all floods, but we can design our infrastructure to protect against them 99 percent of the time. To set the <span class="SmallCaps">crest</span> of a levee or floodwall, engineers use historical flooding records and hydraulic models to estimate how high the 100-year flood would reach along a river. Then they add a little extra, called <span class="SmallCaps">freeboard</span>, to account for uncertainty and to keep waves from overtopping the structures.</p>
<p>Completely enclosing an area at risk of flooding with a levee or wall isn’t always possible. For one, roadways and railroads need a way to cross protected areas. There isn’t always enough space or funding to build ramps or bridges up and over each wall, so we occasionally leave a gap, called a <span class="SmallCaps">closure</span>, through which a road or railway can pass. Steel gates at each closure must be shut in advance of a flood to complete the perimeter. Of course, closures are only feasible for areas along major river basins where floods arrive gradually with some warning. An open gate can defeat the purpose of a floodwall or levee altogether, so closures can’t be used in areas susceptible to flash floods.</p>
<p>In addition, enclosing a low-lying area of the landscape creates a basin that can fill up with water on the wrong side of the wall during storms. Levees need a way to allow drainage to pass through in one direction without allowing the river to backflow into protected areas during floods. Some large-scale systems use pumps to move local drainage out of low-lying areas, but pumps can be expensive. Pipes, called <span class="SmallCaps">culverts</span>, can pass through levees and floodwalls, or their foundations, to allow drainage of enclosed areas to occur by gravity. These culverts are equipped with gates (which must be manually closed during floods) or devices that defend against backflow automatically, called <em>check valves</em>. <span class="SmallCaps">Flap gates</span> are a common type of check valve that seal shut against water pressure coming from the opposite direction.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_147" title="147"/>Although levees protect low-lying areas from flooding, they can create new issues too. Since levees constrain the power of a river to a smaller space, the water flows higher and faster than it would have without such structures, potentially exacerbating flood impacts farther downstream. Even with excellent engineering, our ability to “control” Mother Nature is usually tenuous. Flood control infrastructure is vital in developed areas, but it must be combined with management and respect for rivers’ natural floodplains.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">A common technique for fighting floods is to use stacked bags of sand to impound or divert water. With only a small crew of workers, sandbags can be added to the top of a levee to increase its height or around an unprotected structure to keep floodwaters out. Each bag is typically filled about half full, so it conforms readily with its neighbors without leaving significant gaps. A small trench in the center helps them key into the foundation to withstand the pressure of floodwaters. Bags are stacked in a pyramid shape with a bottom width about three times the height of the berm. A plastic sheet can be added to the upstream face to make the barrier more impermeable.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Water is one of Earth’s most essential resources, but the hydrologic cycle comes with tremendous variability. From droughts to floods and everything in between, achieving a consistent water supply can be a significant challenge. We can’t control how much it rains or how often, but we can develop storage to smooth out the highs and lows of inflow throughout each year. Building a dam across a river valley creates a <em>reservoir</em>, a place where water is stored and can be used over time for irrigating crops, providing water to cities, or generating electricity. </p>
<p>A reservoir can also be kept empty in anticipation of severe weather, allowing a dam to hold back flood waters and release them gradually, reducing the damage they inflict downstream. (Spillways used to discharge water are discussed in a later section.) Many large dams serve multiple purposes at once using different zones within the reservoir, called <em>pools</em>. One pool can be kept full to be used for hydropower or water supply, and one above kept empty to be used for storage in the event of a flood. If a dam is used to generate electricity, the hydropower plant that houses turbines and other equipment is often visible downstream. If the plant isn’t connected to the dam, you might also see the large-diameter pipelines that deliver water to the turbines, called <span class="SmallCaps">penstocks</span>.</p>
<p>A dam can be built from many different materials, but many of the largest and most iconic structures are made from concrete. (The following section describes dams constructed from earth and rock.) Concrete is strong and durable, allowing a dam to withstand the tremendous pressure of water in a reservoir. Unlike many large structures where loads are vertical from the force of gravity, the most significant forces on a dam are horizontal. As the depth of a reservoir increases, so does the <span class="SmallCaps">pressure</span> it exerts on the upstream face of a dam. Water can also leak through pores and cracks in a dam’s <span class="SmallCaps">foundation</span>, creating pressure on the bottom of the structure, called <span class="SmallCaps">uplift</span>. The critical job of withstanding such pressure is a major factor in each dam’s design and physical appearance.</p>
<p><span class="SmallCaps">Gravity dams</span> oppose the force of impounded water simply with their weight. Concrete is quite heavy, and with enough mass, a structure can be stable enough to avoid overturning or sliding from horizontal forces. Gravity dams are usually broad at their base, where water pressure is highest. They taper up to a narrow <span class="SmallCaps">crest</span>, sometimes just wide enough to drive a vehicle over the top, giving them a characteristic slope on the downstream side. Similarly, <span class="SmallCaps">buttress dams</span> transfer the forces from the reservoir into the foundation using triangular <span class="SmallCaps">buttresses</span>. The water pressure still works to push the dam horizontally, but the sloped upstream face takes advantage of the water’s weight for stability as well. Buttress dams require less concrete to construct, but they also require more labor to form the intricate shapes <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_150" title="150"/>needed for stability, so they are generally not economical in modern times.</p>
<p>Unlike gravity and buttress dams, <span class="SmallCaps">arch dams</span> transfer much of the force from impounded water into the <span class="SmallCaps">abutments</span> on each side of the dam instead of the foundation. Like arch bridges (described in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 4">Chapter 4</span>), arch dams take advantage of geometry to span a gap. Because they don’t rely as much on their own weight, arch dams need less concrete and thus can be more economical to construct. However, they can be located only on sites with advantageous geology since the abutments need to resist most of the reservoir forces attempting to push the structure downstream. Thus, arch dams are most often found in narrow, rocky valleys. Some buttress dams are designed as <em>multiple arch dams</em>, where each smaller arch is supported by a buttress instead of a single arch spanning the entire valley.</p>
<p>Concrete dams are not constructed as one solid block—concrete shrinks as it cures from a liquid into a solid, potentially leading to cracks. In addition, changes in temperature cause concrete to expand and contract over the course of a year, which can also cause cracking. Cracks in a sidewalk or driveway may be okay, but in a dam, they can become leaks that weaken and damage the structure. Concrete dams are constructed in smaller blocks, called <span class="SmallCaps">monoliths</span>, with horizontal and vertical <span class="SmallCaps">joints</span> to provide freedom of movement, reducing the likelihood of cracking. Unlike random cracks that could form in a solid concrete structure, joints are easy to seal against leakage using embedded water stops and sealants. Although you can’t see them from the outside, many concrete dams have internal tunnels, called <span class="SmallCaps">galleries</span>, to collect any leaking water and allow engineers to monitor the structure’s integrity from the inside. Galleries also provide a location for drains that relieve pressure within a dam’s foundation.</p>
<p>Another type of concrete structure, usually called a <span class="SmallCaps">low-head dam</span>, is not used to create storage but simply to raise the level in a river or stream. The depth in a natural watercourse varies over time and can be quite shallow for long stretches. Low-head dams impound a small volume of water, artificially raising the level to make a channel more navigable by boats, increase the depth at intakes for water supply and irrigation, or create a drop for powering turbines or waterwheels. Low-head dams are often called <em>weirs</em> because water flows over the top (rather than through a gate or outlet). This overflow can create a significant hazard for swimmers and boaters.</p>
<p>As the jet of water (called the <em>nappe</em>) flows over a low-head dam and plunges into the river below, it can create an area of recirculation immediately downstream of the dam. This area is sometimes called a <span class="SmallCaps">keeper</span> because it can trap objects, debris, and even people. With strong hydraulic forces, the hard surfaces of the dam, disorienting turbulence, and submerged debris, the low-head dam has been known as the perfect drowning machine. Many were constructed long ago when mills and factories relied on waterpower to drive equipment, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_151" title="151"/>and safety was low on the list of priorities. Many cities have removed them or converted them into recreational features, restoring aquatic ecosystems and drawing outside tourism. If you’re swimming or paddling on a river with a low-head dam, don’t underestimate the danger of these seemingly innocuous structures.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Dams are high-risk structures. Since a failure could send a severe flood wave downstream and threaten populated areas, most large dams have comprehensive monitoring plans to keep them safe. In addition to regular inspections by engineers, many dams have instruments that monitor the structures’ integrity. Instrumentation can measure water pressure within a dam or its foundation, settlement or movement, water flow in drains, and even the temperature of concrete over time. Devices can be sensitive enough to see a dam subtly expanding in size from heat on a sunny day. Many dams are also equipped with surveying monuments whose location can be accurately tracked over time by precision measurement equipment. All the data from a dam’s instrumentation provides early warning of conditions that could contribute to a failure, allowing engineers to evaluate and repair problems before they lead to hazardous conditions.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c06-0007"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_153" title="153"/>Embankment Dams</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Although the archetypal dam is a concrete structure, most dams worldwide are constructed using earth or rock. Unlike concrete dams that usually require specific geology and a nearby source of constituent materials (mainly cement and aggregates), <em>embankment dams</em> can be constructed in nearly any location. If there are two materials in abundant supply on Earth, they’re soil and rock. An embankment dam is not just a pile of dirt placed across a river valley, however. Using such primitive materials to impound enormous volumes of water safely is a complex engineering challenge, and attentive observers can notice many of the intricacies of embankment dam design.</p>
<p>Embankment dams can be constructed out of soil, called <em>earthfill</em>, or out of stones or gravel, called <em>rockfill</em>. Both types of material behave much differently than concrete. Because they are granular substances composed of individual particles, earthfill and rockfill are naturally unstable. Gravity is always trying to pull them apart, and the only force holding an embankment together is the friction between individual grains or rocks. Large embankments that can stand tall over the long term and resist pressure from a reservoir must have gentle <span class="SmallCaps">slopes</span> on the upstream and downstream sides. The necessary slope depends on the properties of the material being used, but most earthfill dams have slopes with widths that are around three times their height. The slopes of rockfill structures can be steeper but rarely less than a two-to-one ratio of width to height. That means both earthfill and rockfill embankments have broad footprints that taper as their height decreases toward each end. Many also feature a <span class="SmallCaps">toe berm</span>, an area of additional fill along the bottom of one or both slopes to stabilize the structure further.</p>
<p>Soil and rock can’t simply be dumped into place to create a dam. Granular materials settle and compress over time, and the height of the pile magnifies this effect. We don’t want dams shrinking after they’re built, so fill must be compacted and densified during placement to create a firm and stable structure. Compaction speeds up the settlement process, so it mostly happens during construction instead of afterward. If soil is compacted to its maximum density, that means it won’t settle further over time. Modern construction equipment can compact a layer of soil up to around 30 centimeters (1 foot) thick at a time. Rolling over thicker layers will only densify the surface, leaving the underlying ground loose. So, embankments are constructed slowly from the bottom up in individual layers called <span class="SmallCaps">lifts</span>.</p>
<p>Rockfill and most types of earthfill are permeable materials that can allow water to flow right through (a phenomenon called <span class="SmallCaps"><em>seepage</em></span>). Unlike concrete dams, which accomplish both stability and water tightness with one material, embankment dams often require additional features to hold a reservoir back. Most earthfill dams have <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_154" title="154"/>different zones of material. The <span class="SmallCaps">core</span> is constructed using clay soils that are highly impermeable to seepage. Depending on the site’s geology, finding clay in sufficient volume that meets strict specifications for water tightness can be a challenge. The core is typically the costliest part of an embankment project, so its dimensions are engineered to be only as large as necessary. The outer <span class="SmallCaps">shells</span> have less stringent specifications because they provide only stability and don’t need to be so watertight.</p>
<p>Rockfill dams, being much more porous than earthfill structures, usually include a barrier of concrete, asphalt, or clay in the core or along the upstream slope to make the embankment impervious to seepage. In addition, although not visible from the outside, many embankment dams feature some kind of <span class="SmallCaps">cutoff wall</span> into the foundation. This wall is often constructed from concrete or a clay slurry to close any paths that seepage could take from the reservoir through the dam’s foundation.</p>
<p>The repeated force of waves crashing against a vulnerable earthen structure can create erosion and deterioration. Therefore, nearly all large earthfill dams will have some kind of armoring on the upstream face to protect against long-term damage from waves. Often this armoring consists of a thick layer of rocks called <span class="SmallCaps">riprap</span>. A layer of smaller gravel called <span class="SmallCaps">bedding</span> sits between the dam and larger rocks to prevent soil from washing out from under the riprap. Alternatively, many dams use a mixture of onsite soil and cement, forming an inexpensive but durable armoring called <span class="SmallCaps">soil-cement</span>. It is often placed in lifts along the upstream face of embankments, forming a characteristic stair-stepped appearance.</p>
<p>Beyond the limits of any armoring, embankment dams are usually covered in grass to protect against erosion from rainfall runoff. With their gentle grassy slopes, many embankment dams appear at first glance to be a natural part of the landscape. If you can’t see the reservoir on the other side, you might not even realize a dam is there at all, except for the perfectly level <span class="SmallCaps">crest,</span> which often gives it away.</p>
<p>All dams leak at least a little. Achieving perfect water tightness for such massive structures usually isn’t worth the cost. Instead, engineers make sure that leaks don’t cause problems through the use of drains. Most drains consist of two parts: the <span class="SmallCaps">filter</span> keeps seepage from washing away soil particles using layers of gravel or sand, and perforated <span class="SmallCaps">collector pipes</span> within the filter gather and discharge any water that finds its way into the drain so that it can’t build up pressure. If you see small pipes exiting the downstream side of the dam, they are often <span class="SmallCaps">outlets</span> to the structure’s internal drainage system.</p>
<p>Some dams are not constructed across a stream or river, but rather in upland areas nearby. <em>Off-channel reservoirs</em> are those created by building a circular dam to contain the stored water fully. They must be filled using pumps from a nearby source of water (usually a river). They are often more expensive because the dam must surround the entire perimeter. Still, off-channel <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_155" title="155"/>reservoirs are less disruptive to the natural environment because they don’t create a barrier across a river, and they can be constructed on less sensitive sites.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Although they are vital to humans by storing water, preventing floods, and providing a renewable source of electricity, dams can severely disrupt the natural environment. Many were constructed before strong environmental regulations were in place, leading to unmitigated damage of aquatic ecosystems and natural hydrologic processes. One of the most significant problems they can create is blocking rivers that serve as pathways for migratory fish species. To address this issue, some dams and other artificial barriers in rivers are equipped with <em>fishways</em> (also known as <em>fish ladders</em>) to provide a bypass to the other side. Although various designs are used, most feature a series of pools with low jumps or cascades through which fish can leap. Designing a structure that mimics the flow of a natural river while ascending or descending a sizeable vertical distance is a challenge, and some configurations are more effective than others. However, biologists and engineers continue to work together to reduce the impacts dams have on the natural environment.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c06-0008"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_157" title="157"/>Spillways and Outlet Works</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Although dams are intended for storing water, they need a way to release that water as well, whether it’s because the water is needed or to protect the dam from becoming overfull. There are a variety of different structures that can be used to discharge water from a dam safely, depending on the purpose and capacity. Releasing water is a dynamic process, so spillways and outlet works are often the most complex components of a dam.</p>
<p>Although the terminology can vary, <em>outlet works</em> are generally the facilities that release water from a reservoir to meet downstream needs. Some reservoir outlets deliver water to a pump station that sends it through pipelines for irrigation or to a treatment plant for drinking water in populated areas. Others provide water to the penstocks of hydropower plants. Still others release water back into the river so it can be withdrawn downstream or be used to maintain the aquatic ecosystems below the dam.</p>
<p>Outlet works are sometimes tricky to spot because they may be fully or partially submerged below the reservoir. They are usually located near the center of a dam where the water is deepest. For concrete dams with vertical upstream faces, the outlet works may be inside the dam itself. Because embankment dams slope away from the center, outlet works are often installed as a separate <span class="SmallCaps">tower</span> farther into the reservoir. A <span class="SmallCaps">bridge</span> usually connects the tower to the dam’s crest to provide access for personnel and vehicles.</p>
<p>The primary features of outlets are the gates and valves that control the flow of water. Before reaching them, usually water must first pass through a <span class="SmallCaps">trash rack</span> that prevents debris from entering any facilities where it could cause damage. The trash racks on pump station and hydropower intakes often use fine screens to keep fish from being drawn in.</p>
<p>Many types of gates and valves can control water through an outlet. A gate that’s stuck open or closed can cause severe consequences, so most outlets use a series of flow controls to provide redundancy and facilitate regular maintenance. Most outlets deliver water through the dam inside a large <span class="SmallCaps">conduit</span> made from reinforced concrete or steel. One common type of gate used on outlets is a <em>slide gate</em>, which consists of a metal <span class="SmallCaps">leaf</span> that can be moved up or down across an opening. A <span class="SmallCaps">stem</span> connects the leaf to an <span class="SmallCaps">operator</span>, often using a motor to lift or lower the assembly. The quality and temperature of water in a reservoir can vary depending on the depth below the surface, so outlet towers often feature multiple gates at different levels, allowing operators to select the elevation at which water is drawn. </p>
<p>One of the greatest risks to dams are floods. Building a dam so tall that it can store the most extreme volumes of floodwater possible isn’t practical. On the other hand, a reservoir must never be allowed to overtop a dam because the water will erode and damage the structure and its foundation. So, all dams are designed with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_158" title="158"/>at least one spillway, a structure that can safely discharge water downstream when the reservoir is already full.</p>
<p>Because of the inflow variability, many large dams have two or more spillways. The smaller one is called the <em>principal</em> or <em>service spillway</em> that passes normal inflows when the reservoir is full. The other is called the <em>auxiliary</em> or <span class="SmallCaps">emergency spillway</span> that engages only during extreme events. Depending on the design, the auxiliary spillway may flow for only a few scary moments in a dam’s entire lifetime, so it can be as simple as an excavated channel cut through an abutment. Sometimes an entire section of the dam is armored to allow it to serve as the spillway, called <em>overtopping protection</em>. </p>
<p>Uncontrolled spillways regulate the reservoir level using a <em>weir</em>, a structure that allows water to pass over its fixed crest. The volume of water discharged is strictly related to the level of the reservoir and the spillway’s size and shape. Many uncontrolled spillways use a curved profile over the crest, called an <span class="SmallCaps">ogee</span>, which increases the volume that can be discharged for a given length and flow depth. Some dams use a type of circular weir, called a <span class="SmallCaps">morning glory</span>, that discharges into a conduit. This type of spillway is used in narrow canyons where there isn’t room for a more conventional overflow.</p>
<p>Controlled spillways use gates to manage discharges. Gates add complexity to a spillway, but they can also reduce its cost by providing flexibility in discharge capacity, allowing for a smaller overall structure. <span class="SmallCaps">Tainter gates</span> have long arms and a curved face, and they pivot around a type of hinge called a <span class="SmallCaps">trunnion</span>. A <span class="SmallCaps">hoist</span> above the gate lifts the structure via chains or wire ropes to allow water to flow underneath. <span class="SmallCaps">Crest gates</span> pivot at their bottom and are often operated using hydraulic cylinders. Some gates even rely on large rubber<span class="SmallCaps"> bladders</span> that can be inflated with compressed air or water to raise and lower. All gates require regular inspection and maintenance, so most spillways have <span class="SmallCaps">stoplog slots</span> installed upstream. Stoplogs are steel beams that can be installed in the slots using a crane to block the water so that a gate can be isolated for maintenance (called <em>dewatering</em>).</p>
<p>As water passes through a spillway or outlet, it drops in elevation between the reservoir and natural watercourse downstream, picking up speed as it falls. In an open channel spillway, the water travels down the <span class="SmallCaps">chute</span>, and <span class="SmallCaps">training walls</span> keep the flow contained. Fast-moving water has destructive power that can erode and damage a dam if not carefully controlled, which means both spillways and outlet works need a way to dissipate hydraulic energy and slow down the flow before releasing it into a natural watercourse.</p>
<p>Many types of energy dissipation structures are used on spillways and outlet works. Flows traveling in a conduit may use an <span class="SmallCaps">impact basin</span>, which crashes the water against a solid concrete wall. <span class="SmallCaps">Baffled chutes</span> use blocks to slow down the water as it travels downward. <span class="SmallCaps">Plunge pools</span> allow water to fall into a large, armored hole before leaving in the downstream channel. Larger spillways sometimes feature a <span class="SmallCaps">flip bucket</span> at the end of the chute to launch the flow <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_159" title="159"/>into the air where it breaks into a fine spray. Finally, many spillways use a structure called a <span class="SmallCaps">stilling basin</span> to protect the dam’s foundation from erosion. Stilling basins rely on a phenomenon called a <span class="SmallCaps">hydraulic jump</span> that occurs when fast-flowing water transitions into a slower stream. Most stilling basins use different combinations of <span class="SmallCaps">baffle blocks </span>to force a hydraulic jump to form. The turbulent jump stays within the stilling basin, allowing a smooth, tranquil flow to leave downstream and minimizing the potential for erosion that otherwise would threaten the structure’s integrity.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">The flow of water over a weir is related to both the height of the water over the weir’s crest and the total length. A typical spillway design goal is to minimize the size (and thus, construction cost) without reducing the amount of water it can discharge. One clever engineering strategy is to fold a weir into a zig-zag shape, providing more length within a smaller footprint. This configuration is often used to increase the capacity of a spillway. Using a folded shape can also make it possible to raise a dam’s level (creating more storage) without sacrificing capacity. Weirs that use trapezoidal or triangular shapes are called <em>labyrinth weirs</em>, and those that use square cycles are called <em>piano key weirs</em>.</p>

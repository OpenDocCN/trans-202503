- en: Because of the way HTML works, with each element composed of rectangular blocks
    and right-angled corners, web pages have traditionally appeared boxy, with lots
    of straight horizontal and vertical lines, and the only way to provide any variation
    to this rule was to use images. But back in 2008, the WebKit team proposed a new
    module that allows elements to be rotated, scaled, skewed, and generally messed
    around with. This module was adopted for standardization by the W3C and formalized
    as the 2D Transformations Module (*[http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-2d-transforms/](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-2d-transforms/)*).

- en: Much of the process for transforming elements was adapted from functions in
    the *Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)* language, which is used for drawing two-dimensional
    vector images. SVG is supported by most modern browsers, so Firefox and Opera
    were quick to implement 2D Transformations in their own products, and IE9 followed
    along shortly.

- en: The transformation properties for CSS and SVG were so similar, in fact, that
    the W3C decided to merge them into a single common specification, CSS Transforms
    (*[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-transforms/](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-transforms/)*),
    which is where work on the module continues today. The long and the short of this
    story is that, although the CSS Transforms module is still only a Working Draft,
    the properties within it are well implemented, and you can start using these new
    features right away.

    a piece of paper (the element) and a pin (the origin of that element). If you
    use the pin to stick the paper to a flat surface, you can rotate the paper around
    the pin. By sticking the pin in different places on the paper, you can change
    how the rotation happens—if the pin is stuck in the center of the paper, the rotation
    has a short radius, and the paper on either side of the pin moves equally; if
    the pin is placed at one edge, the whole length of the paper rotates around it.

    can do the same with `matrix()`. This time you have to make use of the *sin (sine)*
    and *cos (cosine)* trigonometric functions. To rotate an element, the `matrix()`
    syntax is:'

    values (if `*b*` is a positive value, `*c*` is the negative of the same value,
    and vice versa). Once again, `*angle*` refers to the degrees of the angle you
    want to rotate the element by. To rotate by 60 degrees, you go back to your scientific
    calculator and calculate the cos and sin of 60\. My calculator tells me that `cos(60)
    = 0.5` and `sin(60) = 0.87`, so the required code is

    using `scale()` in [Figure 12-7](ch12.html#ch12fig7). In the next example, I’ve
    skewed the element by 15 degrees along the *y*-axis (after calculating that `tan(15)
    = 0.268`) and translated it along both axes. The final example shows the element
    rotated by 10 degrees; the values are the results of the calculations I showed
    you previously: `cos(10) = 0.98` and `sin(10) = 0.17`. As mentioned, the `sin`
    value is negative in position `*b*` and positive in position `*c*`, which makes
    the rotation uniform.'

    you to understand, without making it seem so easy you can’t see the scope for
    great flexibility—as long as you keep your scientific calculator with you at all
    times! And if this does seem overly complex, and you’re having trouble understanding
    it, remember you can perform all of these transformations using the individual
    functions, so you can happily forget about `matrix` and trigonometry, too, if
    you wish.

    function. Although some might be tempted to say that if you want to perform complex
    operations, you have to deal with complex syntax, I think the other functions
    in this chapter do a good job of translating that complexity into something simple.
    Just remember, easier options are always available if you get fed up with `matrix()`.'

    far—just a few years ago the notion that you could rotate, skew, and scale elements
    was just a pipe dream, but today you can do just that. And if you think what you’ve
    seen in this chapter is impressive, wait until the next one. I’m going to show
    you how to add an extra dimension—literally—to your transformation effects.

<p class="ChapterIntro">Throughout this book, we’ve examined how to model a range of real-world problems and systems with graph data structures. We’ve also investigated some of the corresponding algorithms to solve these problems. We built upon basic searches, like depth-first and breadth-first search, to construct more complex algorithms for tasks like topological sort and labeling bipartite graphs. We also introduced a variety of more specialized algorithms, such as Kahn’s algorithm for topological sort or the removal algorithm for graph coloring.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Yet this book only scratches the surface of the fascinating world of graphs. A huge volume of research exists on both the theoretical properties of graphs (the mathematical field of <i>graph theory</i>) and practical graph algorithms. For example, recent computer science research has continued to <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_344" aria-label="344"/>develop novel approaches for processing large graphs. A fully comprehensive coverage of graph algorithms is beyond the scope of a single book.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">This book has aimed to introduce the fundamental concepts of graphs and explain various ways to operate on them. It has provided a foundation and basic toolbox. You should be able to adapt the ideas behind these algorithms to techniques beyond this book and easily dive into other graph-related topics.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">As discussed throughout the book, we can often optimize algorithms and implementations to meet the needs of a given use case. As a future step in learning about graphs, I encourage you to try modifying the approaches you’ve learned so far to take advantage of the properties of a specific problem or to avoid unnecessary overhead. For example, rather than storing explicit <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Node</samp> data structures in a graph, it may be more effective in some cases to use a list of neighbors. In others, adding auxiliary data to the node’s representation may help you avoid repeated computation.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Perhaps the most exciting aspect of computer science is the ability to continually explore and build new solutions.</p>&#13;

			<p class="ChapterIntro">Hacking is a practical, useful skill. When used ethically, hacking can help you recover forgotten passwords or access files you thought were lost forever. Learning to hack can also help you protect your personal information from online attackers. In fact, hacking yourself before the bad guys do is one of the best ways to protect yourself from cybercrime.</p>
			<p>
				This book does <em>not</em> encourage criminal activity. It’s designed to teach you how to think like a hacker and apply those skills to problem solving, cybersecurity, and staying safe online.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502000f06-0001">Hacking Basics</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Hacking</em> is doing something new or unexpected with a tool that already exists. Think of “life hacks,” like using dental floss to cleanly cut a slice of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xviii" title="xviii"/>cake or reusing an empty breath mint container to store paper clips. For as long as humans have been on this planet, we’ve been coming up with new tools and new uses for the things we find around us.</p>
			<p>Computer hacking is similar. We do new and unexpected things with computer technology all the time. We can hack together two programs that weren’t meant to work together by writing a small app that translates files from one program’s format to another. We can hack a web browser or spreadsheet program to play a game. Or, if you’re not careful, someone else can hack your computer by emailing you a virus that gives them access to your files, your passwords, or even your webcam.</p>
			<p>
				In this book, we’ll approach computer hacking like a martial art—you’ll learn to punch and kick, as well as how to <em>block</em> punches and kicks. You’ll learn how to defend yourself and others from cyberattacks by safely performing those same hacks on yourself in a virtual lab. By using the same tools and techniques that hackers use, you’ll understand the kinds of online threats you need to defend against.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502000f06-0002">Keeping It Ethical</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Hackers come in many forms, but because the word <em>hacker</em> has been misused so much, we’ll refer to ourselves as <em>ethical hackers</em> in this book—to make it clear that we'll use the hacking skills we learn for ethical, legal purposes. I’ll use the terms <em>attacker</em> or <em>malicious hacker</em> when referring to someone who behaves illegally or unethically.</p>
			<p><em>Ethical hacking</em> is using an attacker’s tools and techniques to test a computer system for weaknesses, with the full permission of the system’s owner. The goal of an ethical hacker is to find weaknesses to improve the system’s security. We call this process <em>hardening</em> the system—removing and addressing weaknesses to make the system less vulnerable to attack.</p>
			<p>
				An ethical hacker is also called a <em>white hat</em> hacker, while a <em>black hat</em> hacker is someone who uses cyberattacks unethically, whether for financial gain, vandalism, or other nefarious reasons. To illustrate the distinction, let’s say you find a key on the sidewalk. Simply finding the key isn’t unethical. In fact, if you walked up to the nearest home, knocked, and asked the owner if the key was theirs, that would be completely ethical. A white hat would ask if the owner of the home had accidentally dropped the key. On the other hand, if you pick up the key and start trying it in doors up and down the street, you’re acting like a black hat, because you don’t have the owner’s permission to use the key or enter their home.</p>
			<p>
				As you go through this book, you’ll discover lots of digital “keys” out in the open. For example, some creative googling might turn up the default username and password to a security camera at a local grocery store. Simply finding this information isn’t unethical. Telling the manager of the store that the security camera is accessible online isn’t unethical either. But if you try to use the username and password to view video from the camera, <em>that’s</em> unethical, because you don’t have authorization from the owner.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xix" title="xix"/>Accessing someone else’s computer or device without their permission is unethical, and usually illegal, just as going into someone’s house without permission is trespassing, even if they accidentally leave the door open or drop their key on the sidewalk. People will judge by your actions whether your behavior is ethical. Hack like a white hat hacker and use the skills you learn in this book for good, not for evil.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502000f06-0003">How This Book Is Organized</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">This book shows you both how to attack and how to defend against attacks. Every chapter builds your skill level as an ethical hacker.</p>
			<p>The first two chapters contain hacks you can perform hands-on, right now, without any special tools—just a regular computer and web browser. You’ll begin by hacking your first password in Chapter 1, a saved web browser password. Attackers are after your passwords because if they can steal your login details, they can steal information or money from your accounts.</p>
			<p>In Chapter 2, you’ll find out how to hack into an old Windows PC or MacBook you might have lying around in a closet, garage, or attic, and you’ll learn how to recover files you thought were lost.</p>
			<p>In Chapter 3, you’ll build a safe, virtual hacking lab environment on your own computer. This will let you safely practice the advanced hacks you’ll learn in later chapters, without putting your computer—or yourself—in harm’s way.</p>
			<p>In Chapter 4, you’ll learn how hackers gather information about a person or company they’re protecting or attacking, using simple tools like a search engine and social media posts. You’ll also learn how to protect yourself from internet predators who use social media to spy on potential victims.</p>
			<p>In Chapter 5, you’ll learn firsthand how attackers trick you into giving up your username and password through phishing emails, because you’ll build your own phishing email and spoofed website!</p>
			<p>In Chapter 6, you’ll see how attackers use virus-infected files to take over computers remotely across the internet. You’ll create an actual virus and hack a simulated Windows computer in your safe, virtual hacking lab.</p>
			<p>In Chapter 7, you’ll see how black hat hackers can steal and “crack” dozens of passwords from every user on a Windows computer, and you’ll learn to make your own passwords safer.</p>
			<p>In Chapter 8, you’ll discover how to attack and defend web applications. Malicious hackers know that a hacked web app can reveal information on thousands or millions of users.</p>
			<p>In Chapter 9, you’ll see how an attacker can take control of your smartphone by creating a malicious mobile app to steal your private information, including text messages and photos.</p>
			<p>In Chapter 10, you’ll hack a (simulated) car! This last exercise provides a window into how attackers are increasingly looking beyond PCs and phones into the world of smart appliances and other networked devices.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xx" title="xx"/>Finally, in Chapter 11, we’ll wrap up with 10 things you can do right now to protect yourself online, summarizing the most important tricks and tips from throughout the book. A few simple self-defense steps can prevent most online attacks from succeeding.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502000f06-0004">Basics of Cyber Self-Defense</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">As you explore the hacks in the chapters ahead, you’ll learn more about the core behaviors white hat hackers use to protect the systems they defend. Good cyber self-defense starts with understanding the dangers from cyber predators and online attackers. The next step is learning how to avoid being an easy target. With more practice, you’ll be able to protect yourself and others from even highly sophisticated real-world attacks.</p>
			<p>You can go from being a cyber victim to becoming a cyber hero just by making a few key changes in the way you use your computer and other devices! Let’s get started!</p>

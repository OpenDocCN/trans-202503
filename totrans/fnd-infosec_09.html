<div class="imagel"><img alt="Image" src="../images/common.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, I’ll discuss physical security, which is the set of security measures that we put in place to protect our people, equipment, and facilities. In most places, you’ll find physical security measures such as locks, fences, cameras, guards, and lighting. In higher-security environments, you might also notice iris scanners, mantraps (an access control that requires you to step through two locking doors to enter a building, similar to a phone booth with two entrances), or identification badges equipped to store certificates.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Physical security involves the protection of three main categories of assets: people, equipment, and data. Your primary goal, of course, is to protect people. People are valuable in their own right and are also more difficult to replace than equipment or data, particularly when they’re experienced in their field and uniquely familiar with the processes and tasks they perform.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_122"/>Although I’ll discuss the protection of people, data, and equipment as separate concepts in this chapter, the security of each is closely integrated. You generally can’t—and shouldn’t—develop security plans that protect any of these categories in isolation from the others.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Many larger organizations protect their assets by implementing sets of policies and procedures collectively referred to as business continuity planning (BCP) and disaster recovery planning (DRP). <em>Business continuity planning</em> refers to the plans you put in place to ensure that critical business functions can continue in a state of emergency. <em>Disaster recovery planning</em> refers to the plans you put in place to prepare for a potential disaster, including what exactly to do during and after a disaster strikes, such as evacuation routes posted on maps throughout the facility or signage indicating meeting places in the case of an evacuation.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec1">Identifying Physical Threats</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Before you can implement any physical security measures, however, you have to identify the threats. Physical security threats generally fall into a few main categories, as shown in <a href="#ch9fig1">Figure 9-1</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch9fig1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/09fig01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 9-1: Categories of physical threats</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Donn Parker defined seven of these categories—extreme temperature, gases, liquids, living organisms, projectiles, movement, and energy anomalies—in his book <em>Fighting Computer Crime</em>, where he also introduces the Parkerian hexad discussed in <a href="ch01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>. (Although written more than a decade ago, I still consider Parker’s book a must-read for security practitioners.)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As you move through the sections in this chapter on protecting people, equipment, and data, I’ll discuss how these threats can affect each asset, if at all.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec2">Physical Security Controls</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Physical security controls are the devices, systems, people, and methods you put in place to ensure your physical security. There are three main types of physical controls: deterrent, detective, and preventive. Each has a different focus, but none is completely separate from the others, as I’ll discuss shortly. Additionally, these controls work best when used in concert. No single one of them is sufficient to ensure your physical security in most situations.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_123"/><em>Deterrent Controls</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Deterrent controls are designed to discourage people who might seek to violate your other security controls, and they generally indicate the presence of other security measures. Examples of deterrent controls include signs in public places that announce that video monitoring is in place as well as yard signs with alarm company logos in residential areas, as shown in <a href="#ch9fig2">Figure 9-2</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch9fig2"><img alt="Image" src="../images/09fig02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 9-2: Deterrent controls</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The signs themselves do nothing to prevent people from acting in an undesirable fashion, but they do point out the potential consequences for doing so. These measures help keep honest people honest.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec2"><em>Detective Controls</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Detective controls, like burglar alarms and other physical intrusion detection systems, serve to sense and report undesirable events. These systems typically check for indicators of unauthorized activity, such as doors or windows opening, glass breaking, movement, and temperature changes. You could also use them to check for undesirable environmental conditions such as flooding, smoke and fire, electrical outages, or contaminants in the air.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Detective systems might also include human or animal guards, whether they’re physically patrolling an area or monitoring it secondhand using cameras or other technology, as shown in <a href="#ch9fig3">Figure 9-3</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch9fig3"><img alt="Image" src="../images/09fig03.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 9-3: Detective controls</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_124"/>Monitoring using guards has both pros and cons. Unlike technological systems, living beings may become distracted, and they’ll have to leave their posts for meals and bathroom breaks. On the other hand, guards are able to make inferences and judgment calls that can render them more efficient or perceptive than technological solutions.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec3"><em>Preventive Controls</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Preventive controls use physical means to keep unauthorized entities from breaching your physical security. Mechanical locks are an excellent example of preventive security because they’re used almost everywhere to secure businesses, residences, and other locations against unauthorized entry, as shown in <a href="#ch9fig4">Figure 9-4</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch9fig4"><img alt="Image" src="../images/09fig04.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 9-4: Preventive controls</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Other preventive controls include high fences, bollards, and, once again, guards and dogs, which are both detective and preventive. These controls might focus specifically on people, vehicles, or other areas of concern, depending on the environment in question.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec4"><em>Using Physical Access Controls</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Preventive controls generally make up the core of our security efforts. In some cases, they may be the only physical security control in place. For example, many houses have locks on the doors but no alarm systems or messages that might deter a criminal.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In commercial facilities, you’re much more likely to see all three types of controls implemented, usually with locks, alarm systems, and signs indicating the presence of the alarm systems. Following the principles of defense in depth, the more physical security layers you put in place, the better off you’ll be.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You should also implement a level of physical security that is consistent with the value of your asset, as discussed in <a href="ch07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>. If you have an empty warehouse, it doesn’t make sense to protect it with high-security locks, alarm <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_125"/>systems, and armed guards. Likewise, if you have a house full of expensive computers and electronics, it doesn’t make sense to equip it with cheap locks and forgo an alarm system entirely.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec3">Protecting People</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Physical security primarily aims to protect the individuals who keep your business running. In many cases, you can restore your data from backups, you can build new facilities if the old ones become destroyed or damaged, and you can buy new equipment, but replacing experienced people within a reasonable period of time is difficult, if not impossible.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec5"><em>Physical Concerns for People</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Compared to equipment, people are rather fragile. They’re susceptible to nearly the entire scope of physical threats outlined in <a href="#ch9fig1">Figure 9-1</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Extreme temperatures</em>, or even not-so-extreme temperatures, can quickly become uncomfortable, as can the absence or presence of certain <em>liquids</em>, <em>gases</em>, or <em>toxins</em>. Even water, in excessive quantities, can cause harm, like in the massive flooding that took place in the southern United States during Hurricane Florence in 2018.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Likewise, the lack of a gas such as oxygen, or too much of it, can become deadly to people very quickly. Certain chemicals benefit us when they’re used in small amounts to filter the water in your facilities but are harmful if the chemical ratios or mixtures change.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A variety of <em>living organisms</em>, from larger animals to nearly invisible molds, fungi, or other microscopic organisms, can be dangerous to people. Animals might bite or sting people; mold might cause breathing problems.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Significant <em>movement</em> is harmful to people, particularly when it comes from an earthquake, mudslide, avalanche, or a building’s structural issue. <em>Energy anomalies</em> are also very dangerous to people. For example, equipment with poorly maintained shielding or insulation, or mechanical or electrical faults, could expose people to microwaves, electricity, radio waves, infrared light, radiation, or other harmful emissions. The consequences of such exposures may be immediately obvious in the case of an electric shock, or they may have long-term effects in the case of radiation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Other <em>people</em> can be one of the most severe threats against people. Someone could physically attack your employees in a dark parking lot. In certain parts of the world, you might encounter civil unrest. You could be susceptible to social engineering attacks, like those discussed in <a href="ch08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, in which the attacker extracts information from your personnel to gain unauthorized access to facilities or data.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Smoke and fire</em> can cause burns, smoke inhalation, and temperature issues (people don’t function well when overheated generally), among other problems. Particularly in large facilities, smoke and fire can render the physical layout of the area confusing and make it difficult for people to navigate their <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_126"/>way to safety. The problem could worsen if your supplies, your infrastructure, or the fabric of the building itself reacts to the heat and releases toxins, collapses, or produces any of the other threats discussed in this section.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec6"><em>Ensuring Safety</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Because many data centers use dangerous chemicals, gases, or liquids to extinguish fires, facilities managers often equip fire suppression systems with safety overrides that prevent them from going off if there are people in the area. Such measures prioritize protecting human life over equipment and data.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec7"><em>Evacuation</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Likewise, during an emergency, you should prioritize evacuating people from the facility, not saving the equipment. Planning evacuation procedures is one of the best ways to keep people safe. The main principles to consider when planning an evacuation are where, how, and who.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Where</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Consider in advance where you’ll be evacuating to. You need to get everyone to the same place to ensure that they’re at a safe distance from the event and that you can account for everyone. If you don’t do this in an orderly and consistent fashion, you may not be able to ensure everyone’s safety. Commercial buildings often display their evacuation meeting places with signs and evacuation maps.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">How</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Also of importance is the route you’ll follow to reach the evacuation meeting place. When planning your routes, you should consider the location of the nearest exit in each area, as well as an alternate trajectory, in case some passages become blocked during an emergency. You should also avoid crossing any potentially dangerous or unusable areas, such as elevators or rooms blocked off automatically by closing fire doors.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Who</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The most vital part of the evacuation, of course, is ensuring that you get everyone out of the building and that you can account for everyone at the evacuation meeting place. This process typically requires at least two designated people: one person to ensure that everyone in the group has left the premises and another at the meeting place to ensure that everyone has arrived safely.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Practice</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Particularly in large facilities, a full evacuation can be a complicated prospect. In a true emergency, if you don’t evacuate quickly and properly, a great number of lives may be lost.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_127"/>As an example, consider the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in the United States. A study conducted in 2008 determined that only 8.6 percent of the people in the buildings evacuated when the alarms sounded. The rest remained inside, gathering belongings, shutting down computers, and performing other such tasks.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch09fn1" id="kch09fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> It’s important that you train your personnel to respond quickly and properly when the signal to evacuate has been given.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec8"><em>Administrative Controls</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Most organizations will also have a variety of administrative controls in place to protect people. Administrative controls may be policies, procedures, guidelines, regulations, laws, or similar rules instituted by any authority, from companies to the federal government.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A common administrative control is background checks companies use to screen potential candidates for a job. These investigations typically involve checks for criminal history, verification of previous employment and education, credit checks, and drug testing, depending on the position being pursued.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A company may also conduct a variety of reoccurring checks, like drug tests, on employees. When a person leaves a job, employers often conduct an exit interview to ensure that the employee has returned all company property and that any accesses to systems or areas have been revoked. The company may also ask the individual to sign paperwork agreeing not to pursue legal action against the company or to sign additional nondisclosure agreements (NDAs).</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec4">Protecting Data</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Second only to the safety of your personnel is the safety of your data. As discussed in <a href="ch05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, the primary way to protect data is by encrypting it. Even so, encryption alone isn’t sufficient; an attacker might access the data by breaking an encryption algorithm or obtaining the encryption keys. Also, encryption won’t protect data from various physical conditions.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Following the concept of defense in depth covered in <a href="ch01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, you should add additional layers of security to keep your physical storage media safe against attackers, unfavorable environmental conditions, and other threats.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec9"><em>Physical Concerns for Data</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Adverse physical conditions, including temperature changes, humidity, magnetic fields, electricity, and physical impact, can harm the integrity of physical media. Moreover, each type of physical media has strengths and weaknesses.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Magnetic media</em>, such as hard drives, tapes, and floppy disks, uses a combination of movement and magnetically sensitive material to record data. Strong magnetic fields can harm the integrity of data stored on magnetic media, especially if the media lacks any metal casing, like magnetic tapes. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_128"/>Additionally, jolting magnetic media while it’s in motion (being read from or written to) can render the media unusable.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Flash media</em>, or media that stores data on nonvolatile memory chips, is hardier. If you avoid impacts that might directly crush the chips that store the data and if you protect the chips from electrical shocks, they’ll generally withstand conditions that many other types of media wouldn’t. They’re not terribly sensitive to temperature, so long as the temperature isn’t extreme enough to destroy the media’s housing, and they’ll often survive brief immersion in liquid, if properly dried afterward. Some flash drives are designed specifically to survive extreme conditions that would normally destroy other media.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Optical media</em>, such as CDs and DVDs, is fragile, as anyone with a small child can attest to. Even small scratches on the surface of the media may render it unusable. It’s also highly temperature sensitive, since it’s constructed largely of plastic and thin metal foil. Outside of a protected environment, such as a purpose-built media storage vault, any of a variety of threats may destroy optical media.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When storing media over an extended period, you should consider technical obsolescence. For example, Sony stopped producing floppy diskettes in March 2011. Prior to that, the company produced 70 percent of all new floppy diskettes.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch09fn2" id="kch09fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> Today, few new computers come equipped with drives to read them, and in a few short years, finding hardware to read these disks will become difficult indeed.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec10"><em>Accessibility of Data</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Not only do you have to protect the physical integrity of your data, you must also ensure that the data is available when you need to access it. This generally means that both your equipment and your facilities must remain in functioning condition and that the media containing your data must be usable. Any of the physical concerns I mentioned can render your data inaccessible as well as unusable.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Some availability issues relate to infrastructure. For example, during an outage, whether it’s related to network, power, computer systems, or other components, you may not be able to access your data remotely. Many businesses operate globally today, so it’s possible that losing the ability to access data from afar, even temporarily, could have serious impacts.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To ensure availability of your data, back up the data itself and the equipment and infrastructure used to provide access to the data. Use <em>redundant arrays of inexpensive disks (RAID)</em>, or RAID array, in a variety of configurations for your backups. RAID is a method of copying data to more than one storage device to protect the data if any one device is destroyed. You can read the original paper describing the basic concept, “A case for redundant arrays of inexpensive disks (RAID),” at the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch09fn3" id="kch09fn3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can also replicate data from one machine to another over a network or make copies of data onto backup storage media, such as DVDs or magnetic tapes.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec11"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_129"/><em>Residual Data</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">On the flipside of being able to access data when you need it, you must be able to render data inaccessible when you no longer need it. For instance, you’d likely remember to shred a stack of paper containing sensitive data before you throw it away. But people often forget about the data stored on electronic media.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In 2016, Blancco conducted a study on 200 used hard drives purchased from eBay and Craigslist. When researchers analyzed the contents of the disks, they discovered that many of them still contained sensitive data, including corporate information, emails, customer records, sales data, pictures, and Social Security numbers. In many cases, nobody had attempted to erase the data from the disks at all; in other cases, they had done so ineffectively.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch09fn4" id="kch09fn4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In addition to the devices that obviously contain storage and hold potentially sensitive data, you might find residual data in machines such as copiers, printers, and fax machines, which may contain volatile or nonvolatile internal storage, often in the form of a hard drive. In the hard drive, you might find copies of any processed documents, including sensitive business data. When you retire these types of devices from service or send them for repair, be sure to remove the data from the storage media.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec5">Protecting Equipment</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Lastly, protect your equipment and the facilities that house it. This category falls last on the list because it represents the easiest and cheapest segment of assets to replace. Even if a major disaster destroyed your facility and all the computing equipment inside it, you could be back in working order very shortly, as long as you still had people to run your operation and access to your critical data.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Although it may take you some time to return to the state you were in before the incident, you can generally replace floor space or relocate to another area nearby relatively easily, and computing equipment is both cheap and plentiful.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec12"><em>Physical Concerns for Equipment</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You will find fewer physical threats to equipment than to employees or data, although they’re still numerous.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Extreme temperatures</em>—especially heat—can harm your equipment. In environments that contain large numbers of computers and associated equipment, we rely on environmental conditioning equipment to keep the temperature down to a reasonable level, typically in the high-60s to mid-70s on the Fahrenheit scale. (Experts still debate the ideal range.)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Liquids</em>, even in small quantities, like the water in humid air, could harm equipment. Depending on the liquid in question and the quantity present, it could cause corrosion in a variety of devices, short-circuits in electrical equipment, and other harmful effects. Clearly, in extreme cases like flooding, any immersed equipment will often become completely unusable.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_130"/><em>Living organisms</em> might also damage equipment, although in more minor ways. Insects and small animals in your facility could cause electrical shorts, interfere with cooling fans, chew on wiring, and generally wreak havoc.</p>&#13;
<div class="sidebar">&#13;
<p class="sidebart"><strong>DON’T BUG ME</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">People started using the term <em>bug</em> to indicate problems in computer systems in September 1947, when someone discovered a moth shorting two connections in a system together, causing the system to malfunction. When workers removed the moth, they described the system as having been debugged.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch09fn5" id="kch09fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> You can see the actual “bug” in question in <a href="#ch9fig5">Figure 9-5</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch9fig5"><img alt="Image" src="../images/09fig05.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 9-5: The first computer bug</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Movement</em>, in the earth and in the structure of your facilities, can hurt your equipment. An earthquake is an obvious example of this. <em>Energy anomalies</em> can be extremely harmful to any type of electrical equipment, especially if the power is absent or sends the wrong amount of voltage. Good facility design will provide some measure of protection against such threats, but you generally can’t mitigate the effects of severe electrical issues, such as lightning strikes.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Smoke and fire</em> are bad for your equipment, as they introduce extreme temperatures, electrical issues, movement, liquids (electronics don’t function well when wet, generally), and a variety of other problems. Efforts to extinguish fires, depending on the methods used, may cause as much harm as the fire itself.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec13"><em>Site Selection</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When planning a new facility, take into account the facility’s location. If the site is in an area prone to natural disasters, you may eventually find <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_131"/>your facility to be completely unusable or destroyed. Other environmental threats could include civil unrest, unstable power or utilities, poor network connectivity, or extreme temperature conditions.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">With proper facility design, you may be able to compensate for some problems by installing power filtering and generators to counteract power problems, for instance. But others, such as the local temperature, may ultimately be out of our control. For certain types of facilities, such as data centers, it’s important to have a problem-free environment, and if you encounter significant environmental issues, you may want to look elsewhere.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec14"><em>Securing Access</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When securing access to equipment or facilities, use the concept of defense in depth by placing security measures at multiple areas, both inside and outside the facility. Again, the appropriateness of the barriers you enforce depends on the context. A military installation may have the highest level of security available; a small retail store may have the lowest level.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Often, you’ll see physical security measures implemented on the perimeter of the property. Minimal measures might control vehicle traffic to make sure it doesn’t enter undesirable places. For example, this can take the form of <em>security landscaping</em>, which can include trees, large boulders, and cement planters, placed in front of buildings or next to driveways to prevent vehicle entry. More secure facilities might also have fences, concrete barriers, and other more obvious measures. Such controls are generally deterrents but may be preventive, as well.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The entrance to the facility will likely have locks, whether mechanical or electronic, on the doors to the building. A typical arrangement for nonpublic buildings is to keep the main entrance unlocked during business hours and station a security guard or receptionist inside. More secure facilities might keep the doors locked at all times and require a badge or key to enter the building.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Once inside the facility, physical access controls could include locks on internal doors or individual floors of the building to keep visitors or unauthorized people from freely accessing the entire facility. Often, facilities will restrict access to computer rooms or data centers to only those who specifically need to enter them for business reasons. You may also find more complex physical access controls in place in such areas, such as biometric systems.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec15"><em>Environmental Conditions</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When it comes to the equipment within your facilities, maintaining proper environmental conditions is crucial to continued operations. Computing equipment can be sensitive to changes in power, temperature, and humidity, as well as electromagnetic disturbances. In areas with large quantities of equipment, maintaining the proper conditions can be challenging, to say the least.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_132"/>People constructing such facilities generally equip them with sources of emergency electrical power, like generators, as well as systems that can heat, cool, and moderate the humidity as required. Unfortunately, these controls are expensive, and smaller facilities might not be appropriately equipped.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec6">Summary</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to mitigate physical security issues using deterrent, detective, and preventive measures. Deterrents aim to discourage those who might violate your security, detective measures alert you to potential intrusions, and preventive controls physically prevent intrusions from taking place. None of these controls is a complete solution by itself, but together, they can put you on stronger footing.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Protecting people should be your foremost concern in physical security. Although you can generally replace data and equipment, you can’t replace people. One of the best ways to protect them is to remove them from dangerous situations quickly. You can also implement a variety of administrative controls to keep them safe in their working environments.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Protecting data should be the next priority in a technology-based business. Make sure your data is available when you need it and that it’s completely deleted when you no longer need it. Ensure its availability by keeping backups, whether by using RAID to protect against storage media failures or with removable devices, such as DVDs or magnetic tape.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Protecting your equipment, although the lowest of your priorities, is still a vital task. When selecting the location of your facility, consider relevant threats and take steps to mitigate them. Take the necessary steps to secure access to and within your facility. Lastly, maintain the environmental conditions appropriate for your equipment.</p>&#13;

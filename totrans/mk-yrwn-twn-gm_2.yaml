  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Twine games, you can use links to influence how a player thinks about and
    uses them in your game. Lists of links are like different choices, similar to
    a restaurant menu. Every decision you make affects how the player understands
    your game, even if it’s as simple as where you place your links and what they
    say.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'You can also use links to shape your story in different ways. Although the
    player can’t see your game’s entire blueprint the way you can, players experience
    your story differently based on the shape of your game. For example, a sequence
    of short passages with one or two links each feels fast: *bang*, *bang*, *bang!*
    In contrast, a long passage bristling with lots of different links encourages
    the player to linger because there are so many details to take in!'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In many Twine games, people write their links in a list at the bottom of the
    passage, just as I did in *Interview with a Cat!* This approach works well in
    an interview game: my cat says something, you pick a question, she answers, and
    you pick another question.'

    either one thing or the other. For example, the player might need to decide whether
    to ride a magic dragon or a magic fruit bat, but they can’t ride both. By listing
    the choices side by side, you invite the player to compare them and decide.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As another example, let’s say you’re drinking tea with the monster under your
    bed, as in *Spider Milk*, and the monster offers you some spider milk. You could
    emphasize the choice by placing the links at the bottom of the passage, as shown
    here.

    *Back* link at the bottom of the page. The *Back* link takes the player back to

    their tea. These extra details make your game more fun and engaging.

    the *tea* link is the end of this scene by setting it apart from the other links.
    Conversely, we place the *chandelier*, *pillows*, and *candles* links in the same
    paragraph to make them seem similar to each other.

    to move forward.'

    foyer other than hang up their coats: it’s a place of transitions.'

    smaller, more intimate side rooms.

    a secret place they can’t get to any other way. Maybe your player can find a little
    door to a backyard where they can get away from the party and look at the stars
    for a while. The possibilities are endless!

    the entryway on their way out, the player remembers what it looked like when they
    first arrived and can reflect on how their impression has changed. They retrieve
    their coat. It’s time to go home.

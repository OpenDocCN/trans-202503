<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">W</span>hen software engineers talk about media, they’re usually referring to <em>multimedia</em>, meaning audio and video. These technologies are very distinct from each other and both require deep domain expertise. So engineers usually work on one or the other, not both. Nevertheless, audio and video engineers are usually collected into the same “media” team. Maybe it’s because they both require such power and memory from the device—and such extreme optimizations in the software—in order to work reliably for the user.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c12-0001">Dave Sparks and Ringtones</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Dave Sparks only took one programming course in his life, a Fortran class when he was a sophomore in high school. Writing programs in that class consisted of typing the code onto punch cards, which were then wrapped with a rubber band and couriered to the district office, where they would be executed on the computer there. Students would get the results of their program on a printout a few days later.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c12-footnote-1" id="c12-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Dave was more intrigued by the old Monrobot XI system in the back of the classroom, a circa 1960 machine that used a rotating magnetic drum for storage. He learned how to program machine code on that old system, nearly failing the Fortran class in the process.</p>
<p>His programming career began after high school, while he was working in a RadioShack. Ray Dolby<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c12-footnote-2" id="c12-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup> came into the store one day looking for help; he <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_112" title="112"/>wanted a program to download his stock data into a spreadsheet. The manager pointed at Dave as someone who could help. One program and $50 later, Dave was a professional programmer.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, carriers required mobile phones to support a variety of ringtone formats. Complicating the requirement more was the fact that different carriers used different formats, so phone manufacturers would have to support multiple formats in order to be able to sell their devices into different markets.</p>
<p>Yamaha offered a dedicated synthesizer chip that could handle the requirements, for a cost of a couple dollars per handset. Manufacturers are always looking for ways to cut costs, so a company called Sonivox introduced a software-based solution instead, selling it for just a dollar per handset.</p>
<p>Dave Sparks was in charge of that product at Sonivox when Andy Rubin came calling.</p>
<p>With Android’s plans to open source the OS, Andy’s needs were different from Sonivox’s typical customers; he wanted the product, but also to publish the source code for it, effectively eliminating future sales. Dave remembered the deal as, “This is going to be open sourced in the future. Here’s a pile of money.”</p>
<p>The deal happened in early 2007. In March, Dave came to Google and spent a couple hours with Ficus Kirkpatrick to integrate that software into the system. Suddenly, Android could play ringtones.</p>
<p>Months later, Andy called Dave, who was still at Sonivox, and asked him to join Android to build a media team. Dave joined Android in August of 2007.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c12-0002">Marco Nelissen and Audio</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">After Ficus got ringtones working with the Sonivox software, he also got a single MP3 ringtone working: “Crazy” by Gnarls Barkley. Joe Onorato explained, “mp3 playback was a ton of work. As soon as he got that working, we needed a ringtone. He checked in an MP3 of ‘Crazy’ and that was The Ringtone.”</p>
<p>With all Android phones playing that same ringtone for every phone call, the song was driving everyone . . . well, you know.</p>
<p>The team needed help generalizing the ringtone system, so they hired someone that had been writing audio software for years: Marco Nelissen.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_113" title="113"/>When he was in high school in the Netherlands, Marco’s parents bought him a Commodore 64. Initially, he just played games on it, but he soon started programming on it, learning BASIC and then assembly. He wrote text editors and then began playing with multimedia applications as well, including a music sequencing app called SoundTracker Pro.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c12-footnote-3" id="c12-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>After college, he continued working in multimedia, first at a company writing software for Philips CD-i platform, and then at Be. Like many colleagues at Be, he joined Palm after its acquisition of Be. He stuck around at PalmSource longer than most of his team, who had mostly joined Google to work on Android by early 2006. Marco finally joined the Android team in January of 2007.</p>
<p>Marco dove into Android’s audio functionality. His first project was to add the increasingly important ability to select a different ringtone. “Not that I didn’t like that song, but when you heard the same thing every few minutes when someone’s phone rang, it got tiring.” </p>
<p>He continued working on sound and multimedia in general. He added sound capabilities to the simulator (which was used by the team for debugging their software), and eventually wrote the first music app for Android. He also later wrote a couple of the first Live Wallpapers (sound and music visualizers) for the Eclair (Android 2.1) release, which shipped with the Nexus One.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c12-0003">AudioFlinger</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Another audio problem that had to be solved was for the G1. The original HTC audio drivers for that device were so buggy that even doing something as simple as trying to play a second sound while one was already playing would reboot the device. The Android team didn’t have access to the source code for that driver, so they worked around the problem by introducing a layer on top of the driver called AudioFlinger.</p>
<p>Mathias came up with the name, based on his experience writing SurfaceFlinger. SufaceFlinger solved a related problem on the graphics side, where many applications produced buffers of pixel data that SurfaceFlinger displayed on the screen. Similarly, AudioFlinger combined multiple audio <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_114" title="114"/>streams across the system into a single stream which would then be sent to the driver without (and this is the key part) causing the device to reboot. Mathias worked with Marco, Arve, and Ficus to get it working for the G1. It was only supposed to be a temporary workaround in the platform for that specific device, but as often happens in software, it lived on far past its usefulness until it was finally rewritten so that the system could talk more directly to drivers that didn’t have those historical problems.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c12-0004">The Video Code Nobody Liked</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Handling video is complicated. For one thing, video needs codecs<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c12-footnote-4" id="c12-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup> to load and save video files. Video software also needs the capability to play content that has been loaded by a codec. And once you have all of that working, you need to optimize it to happen quickly, because a video that can’t play smoothly is less “video” and more “frustrating.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the software needs to be able to talk to the hardware, which is tricky because video-specific hardware can vary widely between devices.</p>
<p>With such a small team, it would have been difficult to implement everything that video required. So Andy made the decision to buy the necessary technology instead of writing it in-house. He asked Ficus Kirkpatrick to check out some options, but had him focus on a company called PacketVideo. PacketVideo, at the time, licensed an entire suite of software to do all of what Android needed. </p>
<p>The deal was going to happen; Ficus’s investigation was more like a sanity-check than a deep analysis. Ficus remembered, “Andy told me he was going to do the deal no matter what.” Like the rest of the team, he was busy with other things at the time, and it seemed like a foregone conclusion, so he didn’t spend a lot of time evaluating the situation: “I didn’t think it mattered. I didn’t think the code was good, but didn’t speak up.”</p>
<p>He briefly investigated other options. He vetoed one of the alternatives because of the state of their code. That other company was so focused on making their product work on Windows that they baked assumptions into the software that made it unusable on any other OS (such as Linux, which <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_115" title="115"/>was what Android needed). Comparatively, PacketVideo was a better choice. “It was probably the least awful of the media frameworks I looked at.” </p>
<p>The deal that Andy was proposing was awkward for PacketVideo; he was proposing to give away the core of their business. The company made its money from licensing their video software. Android needed not only the functionality of their code, but also the code itself. Android was planning to open source all of the code for the platform, including PacketVideo’s code. So the deal Andy proposed was that Android would take their software and publish it in the open, essentially destroying any future licensing possibilities they might have had, because any potential clients could just copy the Android code. Ficus said, “Andy’s pitch to them was, ‘Your business is going to change from licensing to professional services. We will give you some money to bridge the transition.’”</p>
<p>The deal was done (with the help of Tom Moss<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c12-footnote-5" id="c12-footnoteref-5">5</a></sup>), the code was integrated, and the Android team was . . . not happy.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c12-footnote-6" id="c12-footnoteref-6">6</a></sup> Ficus remembered, “The code was not very good. Optimizing it was really hard.”</p>
<p>Mathias Agopian agreed. “It was a disaster, from a technical standpoint. PacketVideo on paper was really good: tons of codecs, playback, recording, video, audio. On paper, problem solved. But we spent many, many, many years fixing and eventually rewriting everything.”</p>
<p>Ficus continued: “Probably my only good contribution was refusing to ship their API and only shipping the extremely simple MediaPlayer/MediaRecorder [APIs]. This was a low complexity, low capability API that made it possible to move a lot of the stuff around under the hood.” That is, by offering only simple and generic video capabilities to application developers, instead of exposing more advanced PacketVideo features directly, Ficus ensured that the details of how video was implemented could change later, when the team had more time to deal with the problem.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_116" title="116"/>In fact, this was what eventually happened. Years later, this layer of the system was completely rewritten as a component called <em>stagefright</em>. Andreas Huber, an engineer on the media team at the time, had been steadily rewriting portions of the PacketVideo code. Eventually he realized that the old code wasn’t being called anymore, so he deleted it and the PacketVideo code was no more.</p>

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c12-footnoteref-6" id="c12-footnote-6">6.</a></sup>  An important element of software development is that a project is not done when it ships (at least not if the project is successful). The code has to continue to be supported by the team for as long as that functionality remains in the product. So even if the video code did what it needed to do, it was still a burden on the team because of ongoing bugs, performance issues, additional feature requirements, and general maintenance for years to come.</p></aside>

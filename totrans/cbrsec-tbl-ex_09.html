<p class="CO">In this chapter, we turn our attention to tabletop exercises that target an executive audience, which can include an organization’s C-level employees and the leaders of various teams, such as business operations, human resources, legal, and marketing.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">It isn’t unusual for cybersecurity incidents, especially those that bleed into the public realm or interrupt operations, to require these cross-functional leaders to collaboratively manage the response. Unfortunately, while technical teams regularly work together, it’s less common for, say, the legal and marketing teams to collaborate. For this reason, it’s important to conduct regular tabletop exercises that test leadership’s ability to work together in response to an incident.</p>&#13;

<p class="TNI">Organizations that wish to run both a technical and a senior exercise often use the same scenario, then alter the injects to fit each audience. <span class="Xref1"><a href="chapter6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a></span> outlined a ransomware tabletop exercise meant for technical participants, and the following exercise adapts the same scenario for an executive audience. The events discussed will be similar; however, the facilitator’s questions and the discussion line will focus on the business ramifications of the scenario.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec2"><span id="h-144"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">The Scenario</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">In this ransomware scenario, the executive audience must consider strategic issues involved in the response process, such as facing business downtime, managing internal and external communications, determining whether to pay a ransom, and considering other factors. While short, the story arc contains many common strategic and high-visibility items that an executive team will be forced to contend with during a ransomware event.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Begin the scenario with users reporting that they can’t access files on the Fire Lake City Schools file servers. Fire Lake City Schools is a large city school district with over 4,000 students. This issue has persisted for nearly four hours before the executive team is notified.</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">How does a lack of file access impact the school district?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">What data in the file shares would pose a concern if a threat actor gained access to them?</li>&#13;

<p class="TNI">Out of frustration, an employee posts several messages on social media saying that they are unable to work due to “stupid cybercriminals” who have locked them out of their computer and files. The employee has a sizable social media following, and the post immediately receives comments and shares.</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Is there a social media policy in place? Are the school district’s employees aware of the policy?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Does the post necessitate any internal or external messaging?</li>&#13;

<p class="TNI">The school district’s director of information security notifies the chief information officer (CIO) of an ongoing ransomware incident in the environment. The threat actor has requested 20 Bitcoin in return for the decryption keys. The district’s technical personnel are assessing whether they can use <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_137" aria-label="137"/>backups, but in the meantime, the information technology infrastructure remains largely inoperative.</p>&#13;

<li class="BL">Based on the few known details, what other information does the school district need to determine whether to even consider paying a ransom?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Who needs to be notified and involved?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Does the school district have the means to pay the ransom? Does it have a Bitcoin wallet, for example, or another external resource under contract that could assist with payment?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">As a public school system, is Fire Lake City Schools beholden to any laws or regulations prohibiting ransom payments? Who can help the district understand those laws or regulations?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Should the district notify its cyber insurance provider, if there is one? Does the carrier have resources the district could bring to bear?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Can Fire Lake’s police department help? If so, how?</li>&#13;

<p class="TNI">A local news outlet catches wind of the potential ransomware outbreak and calls members of Fire Lake City Schools looking for an official statement. Given that the school district is a public entity, there is considerable interest in the event. The front desk has notified the response team of these calls, as have numerous employees who have been solicited for comment.</p>&#13;

<p class="TNI">To adapt the scenario, consider making the following modifications:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">The amount of Bitcoin requested is significantly higher.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">The ransomware has fully encrypted primary and secondary backups, rendering them unusable.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">The threat actor contacts media outlets and informs them that the school district has been attacked.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">The threat actor has exfiltrated data and threatens to release the contents if a larger payment isn’t made.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Sensitive data, including the personally identifiable information (PII) of students and employees, is accessed and exfiltrated.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Especially sensitive student records, such as mental health history and counseling notes, are accessed and leaked.</li>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec8"><span id="h-146"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">A Dark Web Data Discovery</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Sometimes an organization doesn’t realize it’s been compromised until a law enforcement agency notifies it that confidential company information has been found online. On the other hand, some organizations actually employ services to monitor the dark web for their organizational secrets. In either case, if a leak occurs, the organization must determine how it lost control of the data and how to respond.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec9">&#13;
<h4 class="H2"><span id="sec9"/><span id="h-147"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">The Scenario</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">In this scenario, a vendor employed by the organization to perform dark web and open source intelligence monitoring discovers internal employee data for sale on the dark web. The loss of sensitive data is quickly escalated to leadership, who are forced to confront the reality that they have lost control of their data.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">In the introduction, UrData, a firm specializing in sweeping various corners of the internet to look for sensitive data, spots data that appears to belong to one of their clients, Old Prairie Bank. UrData notifies Old Prairie’s CIO of a dark web posting purporting to make sensitive Old Prairie data available for sale. The listing claims to include Old Prairie customer PII (names, dates of birth, addresses, account balances, and other account information). However, UrData hasn’t yet obtained a sample set.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_139" aria-label="139"/>UrData informed Old Prairie’s CIO that the full data set is being sold for $26,000.</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">At this point, is this considered a cybersecurity incident for Old Prairie, as defined by the incident response plan?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">What actions should the CIO take upon receiving such a notification?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Who within the organization needs to be notified?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Does Old Prairie have an inventory of systems containing the specific customer PII? Is it possible to narrow down which systems were potentially compromised based on where PII resides?</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;

<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Do these new details change what decisions should be made?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Who within the organization can validate that the data is indeed Old Prairie’s?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Is it possible to quickly figure out the locations where the data is stored and where the data sets originated?</li>&#13;

<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Will Old Prairie entertain purchasing the data set at the reduced price?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Does the fact that the group is possibly associated with North Korea, a country that may be under regulatory scrutiny, impact the bank’s decision of whether to purchase the data set?</li>&#13;

<p class="TNI">As the threat landscape continues to evolve, so do the types of attacks we see happening. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have been around for some time, but ransom-based DDoS attacks, like the one we explore here, are increasing in popularity. It’s important to understand how to respond to this unique attack type, as well as how your organization can continue to operate in the event of a prolonged attack. Executing a tabletop exercise to discuss a DDoS attack is one way to test organizational capabilities.</p>&#13;

<p class="TNI">In this scenario, a DDoS attack affects an online lender’s website functionality. Any organization with a web presence could adapt this scenario to fit its use case, though it would be particularly impactful for organizations whose business is conducted through their website (compared to those that merely use their website to provide public information).</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Begin with the web team for QuickPaydayLoans.net discovering an outage of its external website that affects all functionality, including loan applications, bill pay, transfers, and account access. The lender’s public-facing informational website is also impacted.</p>&#13;

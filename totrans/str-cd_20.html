<p class="noindent">We’ve reached the end, so let’s make it a good one. I sincerely hope your adventure with programming languages continues. To aid you on your quest, I offer micro-vignettes of additional esolangs you may wish to investigate, a collection of links to increase your programming language prowess, and a brief postlude.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev1sec105"><strong>The Runners-Up</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">There are too many excellent esolangs out there to include all of them in a single book; choices had to be made. This section presents micro-vignettes of the esolangs that didn’t make the cut. Let them inspire you to explore, wonder, design, and code.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2sec139"><strong><em>Malbolge</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">How difficult can a programming language be to use but still be Turing complete? In 1998, Malbolge’s creator, Ben Olmstead, attempted to answer that question. The resulting language was so difficult to code in that two years passed before Andrew Cooke presented a working “Hello, world!” <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_416"/>example. The name, Malbolge, is a (purposeful?) misspelling of <em>Malebolge</em> the eighth circle of hell from Dante’s <em>Inferno</em>—the level reserved for swindlers and cheats.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Malbolge runs on a virtual machine using base-3 numbers or <em>trits</em> (ternary digits). Malbolge’s virtual machine is a von Neumann architecture with memory and code sharing the same space, thereby allowing self-modifying code.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To experiment with Malbolge, download the original version and associated files from <em><a href="http://esoteric.sange.fi/orphaned/malbolge/">http://esoteric.sange.fi/orphaned/malbolge/</a></em>, placing the files in the <em>Malbolge</em> directory of the book’s repo.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Building the interpreter is easy. Just compile the C source file as follows:</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">malbolge.c -o malbolge</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Hello, world!” in Malbolge, which was found by an extensive computer search, is</p>&#13;
<pre>(=&lt;`#9]~6ZY327Uv4-QsqpMn&amp;+Ij"'E%e{Ab~w=_:]Kw%o44Uqp0/Q?xNvL:`H%c#DD2^WV&gt;gY;dts76qKJImZkj</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You’ll find it in <em>hello.mal</em>. To see that it works, run the following command:</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">malbolge hello.mal</span>&#13;
Hello, world.</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">The virtual machine is described in <em>malbolge.txt</em> with an alternative description available at <em><a href="https://esolangs.org/">https://esolangs.org/</a></em> on the Malbolge page. The truly daring can satisfy their lust for adventure by working through the “Malbolge Programming” article at <em><a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Malbolge_programming">https://esolangs.org/wiki/Malbolge_programming</a></em>, which is itself a reworking of Lou Scheffer’s original investigations (see <em><a href="http://www.com/malbolge.shtml">http://www.com/malbolge.shtml</a></em>).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It’s likely Malbolge <em>is</em> the most difficult programming language in the world. Using the eighth circle of hell as the name is clever, though. Is Malbolge really a fraud? To me, it’s a classic example of what an esolang encapsulates: it’s the result of a specific, pointed question. It does appear that Malbolge is Turing complete, which makes it all the more interesting.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Dante’s ninth circle is reserved for the treasonous. It might be interesting to contemplate a successor to Malbolge, that is, one reflecting the ninth circle, a language that breaks trust with the programmer, perhaps by randomly providing wrong answers.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2sec140"><strong><em>INTERCAL</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">INTERCAL (“Compiler Language With No Pronounceable Acronym”) was developed by Don Woods and James Lyon in 1972. INTERCAL was meant as a joke. For example, if the compiler is given a program that does not use the <span class="literal">PLEASE</span> keyword often enough, it is rejected for being impolite. Similarly, if <span class="literal">PLEASE</span> appears too frequently, the compiler will reject the program as overly polite. Perhaps the most interesting part of INTERCAL is its humorous documentation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_417"/>Humor aside, INTERCAL is Turing complete. To work with it, I suggest using the implementation included in Q. P. Liu’s collection of esolang implementations. To install it, use</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">git clone https://github.com/qpliu/esolang.git</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Liu’s implementation is in Go, which you can install like so:</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">sudo apt-get install golang-go</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">To build INTERCAL, change to the INTERCAL directory and run <span class="codestrong">make</span>.</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">cd esolang/intercal</span>&#13;
&gt; <span class="codestrong1">make</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Liu’s implementation includes a compiler and interpreter plus some examples. We’ll use the interpreter. The compiler threw an error on <em>hello.i</em> when I tried it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To run the interpreter, use</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">./COMPILAC examples/hello.i</span>&#13;
<span class="codeitalic1">&lt;code listing deleted&gt;</span>&#13;
GOOD BYTE, CRUEL WORLD!</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">What’s impressive to me is the INTERCAL implementation of <em>Adventure</em>. <em>Adventure</em>, created in the mid-1970s, was the first interactive fiction text adventure game. It’s sometimes known as <em>The Colossal Cave</em> and, in parts, became most of Infocom’s <em>Zork</em> series of games for microcomputers. <em>Adventure</em> was written by Will Crowther and Don Woods, the same Don Woods who created INTERCAL. Let’s run it.</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">./COMPILAC examples/ADVENT.I</span>&#13;

<p class="notep"><em>In <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>, we discussed the Befunge program bridge.bf, which included the word xyzzy. If you continue to play</em> Adventure, <em>you’ll eventually find a use for xyzzy.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">INTERCAL supports 16-bit and 32-bit integers, which are identified by a prefix and a decimal number in the range [1, 65535]. For example, <span class="literal">.123</span> (“spot”) is a 16-bit integer, whereas <span class="literal">:123</span> (“two-spot”) is a 32-bit integer. INTERCAL also supports 16-bit and 32-bit arrays that are prefixed with <span class="literal">,</span> (“tail”) or <span class="literal">;</span> (“hybrid”) and a number. Constants are prefixed with <span class="literal">#</span> (“mesh”).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">INTERCAL has five operators, all of which are bit-oriented. This includes two binary, “mingle” and “select,” and three unary logical operators: AND, OR, and XOR.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Select” (<span class="literal">~</span>) picks bits from the first operand based on the bits set in the second, building the result bit by bit from right to left. The example from the manual is <span class="literal">#179~#201</span>, which returns <span class="literal">9</span>. To see it, first write the arguments in binary: 10110011<sub>2</sub> = 179 and 11001001<sub>2</sub> = 201. Then, find all the one bits in 201—bits 7, 6, 3, and 0—and build the result from the corresponding bits of 179, which are 1, 0, 0, and 1, that is, 1001<sub>2</sub> = 9.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Unary logical operators are atypical. The INTERCAL manual uses the example of <span class="literal">#V77</span> to apply logical-OR to the constant value, 77. <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch016fig1">Figure 16-1</a> shows the operation.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch016fig1" src="Images/16fig01.jpg" alt="Image" width="551" height="115"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 16-1: Unary OR in INTERCAL</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The input, a 16-bit integer, 77, is on the top. The arrows show successive pairs of bits that are ORed together to produce the marked output bit. Notice that the output’s most significant bit is the logical-OR of the last and first bit of the input.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">INTERCAL’s logical operators map to Wolfram’s 1D cellular automata. A 1D <em>cellular automaton</em> is a rule that maps an input to an output by examining three bits at a time. There are 256 such rules for bytes, one of which, Rule 30, is chaotic enough to serve as a good pseudorandom number generator. The rule names correspond to the integer value of the output bits.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_419"/>INTERCAL’s OR operator implements Rule 238. It may be written as</p>&#13;
<pre>111 110 101 100 011 010 001 000&#13;
 1   1   1   0   1   1   1   0  = 238</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">To find the output bit value for a given input, examine the center bit and the two neighbors on either side. Then, match that bit pattern to the rule table to set the output bit as indicated. The output is built bit by bit, that is, it does not modify the input in place. For example, if the input bit is 1 and the neighbors to the left and right are 0 and 1, respectively, then Rule 238 says 011 → 1, meaning the corresponding bit position in the output is set to 1.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Apply the Rule 238 table to the input of <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch016fig1">Figure 16-1</a>. You’ll see that the output matches. Similarly, INTERCAL’s AND operator (<span class="literal">&amp;</span>) matches Rule 136 and the XOR operator (<span class="literal">?</span>) implements Rule 102.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To learn more about INTERCAL, or to simply appreciate the humor, check out the full manual (<em><a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/intercal-man/">http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/intercal-man/</a></em>).</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2sec141"><strong><em>Whitespace</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">INTERCAL is a joke language that’s powerful enough to do useful things. Whitespace is another joke language. And like INTERCAL, it’s also Turing complete: Whitespace has sequence, unbounded heap storage, conditional looping, and subroutines.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In Whitespace, the only valid program characters are space, tab, and newline (ASCII 10, linefeed, LF). Everything else is ignored. Therefore, a clever person with too much free time might embed a Whitespace program inside code for another language, perhaps as super-secret spy code or the like. Or perhaps not.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As a programming language, Whitespace is rather typical. There is a stack, like Forth, and a heap for generic storage. Input and output commands work with numbers or characters, like Befunge. In reality, the only exciting part of Whitespace is its chosen symbol set. All the same, it makes most lists of “Try these bizarre programming languages,” so it’s worth a cursory peek at the very least.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I experimented with the C implementation by GitHub user Koturn. Clone it and build it like so:</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">git clone https://github.com/koturn/Whitespace.git</span>&#13;
&gt; <span class="codestrong1">cd Whitespace</span>&#13;
&gt; <span class="codestrong1">make</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">There are several examples in the <em>t</em> directory. Kudos for using a short pathname. For example:</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">./whitespace.out t/hworld.ws</span>&#13;
Hello, world of spaces!&#13;
&gt; <span class="codestrong1">./whitespace.out t/fact.ws</span>&#13;
Enter a number: <span class="codestrong1">10</span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_420"/>&#13;
10! = 3628800&#13;
&gt; <span class="codestrong1">./whitespace.out t/hanoi.ws</span>&#13;
Enter a number: <span class="codestrong1">3</span>&#13;
1 -&gt; 3&#13;
1 -&gt; 2&#13;
3 -&gt; 2&#13;
1 -&gt; 3&#13;
2 -&gt; 1&#13;
2 -&gt; 3&#13;
1 -&gt; 3</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">The difficult part of Whitespace is writing code in it. You can’t easily use a normal text editor because you need to be able to input whitespace and still see what you are typing. For example, like Befunge, Whitespace has two input and two output commands:</p>&#13;
<pre>[tab][space]    read a character to the heap&#13;
[tab][tab]      read a number to the heap&#13;
[space][space]  output top of the stack as a character&#13;
[space][tab]    output top of the stack as a number</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">However, visualizing which command is which is problematic. Fortunately, Whitespace IDEs do exist; see <em><a href="https://vii5ard.github.io/whitespace/">https://vii5ard.github.io/whitespace/</a></em>. <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch016fig2">Figure 16-2</a> shows a typical session with the Whitespace code in the middle (shown in gray in print and in color online) and a text version of the program on the far right.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch016fig2" src="Images/16fig02.jpg" alt="Image" width="680" height="406"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 16-2: A Whitespace IDE</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_421"/>This slick IDE is the work of Henri Lakk. Do review the main GitHub page at <em><a href="https://github.com/vii5ard/whitespace/">https://github.com/vii5ard/whitespace/</a></em> for more information. The IDE includes an embedded BF interpreter written in Whitespace, which is simply brilliant.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2sec142"><strong><em>Shakespeare</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">William Shakespeare (1564–1616) is generally regarded as the best English playwright. Why mention Shakespeare in a book on programming languages? Enter the Shakespeare Programming Language, stage right. Shakespeare, courtesy of Karl Wiberg and Jon Åslund, turns text that reads like a Shakespearean play into executable code.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The main Shakespeare page is at <em><a href="http://shakespearelang.sourceforge.net/">http://shakespearelang.sourceforge.net/</a></em>. From there, download the Shakespeare tarball, <em>spl-1.2.1.tar.gz</em>, and install it, ignoring build errors.</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">tar spl-1.2.1.tar.gz</span>&#13;
&gt; <span class="codestrong1">cd spl-1.2.1</span>&#13;
&gt; <span class="codestrong1">make</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">SPL is a compiler from Shakespeare to C. Several examples are included, all of which work nicely except <em>fibonacci.spl</em>. To run SPL, follow this pattern:</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">./spl2c &lt;examples/hello.spl &gt;hello.c</span>&#13;
&gt; <span class="codestrong1">gcc hello.c -o hello -I. libspl.a -lm</span>&#13;
&gt; <span class="codestrong1">./hello</span> &#13;
Hello World!</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">A newer project has created an interpreter in Python. This project aims to make it easier to develop Shakespeare code. The GitHub site is <em><a href="https://github.com/zmbc/shakespearelang/">https://github.com/zmbc/shakespearelang/</a></em>, but it’s easiest to install with <span class="literal">pip</span>.</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">pip install shakespearelang</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The result is <em>shakespeare</em>, which is able to run the SPL listed examples above.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="h4" id="lev2sec143"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_423"/><strong><em>Whirl</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Whirl (and Taxi, detailed in the next section) are two innovative esolangs created by Sean Heber. We’ll use Mateusz Chudyk’s Python implementation to explore Whirl. Grab it from GitHub.</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">git clone https://github.com/mateuszchudyk/whirl-interpreter.git</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The interpreter runs out of the box, but I recommend two simple tweaks to the Python source to make the output look nicer. Do the following, substituting your favorite editor if necessary</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">cd whirl-interpreter</span>&#13;
&gt; <span class="codestrong1">vi whirl/commands.py</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">and then change line 194 to read</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codestrong1">print(int(program_state.get_memory_value()), end="")</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Likewise, change line 214 to</p>&#13;
<pre><span class="codestrong1">print(chr(program_state.get_memory_value()), end="")</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">These changes prevent output from automatically advancing to the next line.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Validate Whirl like so:</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">python3 whirl-interpreter.py examples/fibonacci.whirl</span> &#13;
1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Yay, Whirl works. But what is it? Whirl has only two instructions: 0 and 1. Seriously, that’s it. Whirl consists of two rings with operations and functions on them; imagine actual circular rings with operations and instructions spaced equally along them. The first ring is the “operations ring” that holds 12 control, logic, and I/O operations. The second ring is the “math ring” with 12 math functions. Each ring also holds a single data value. Additionally, there is an “infinite” memory accessed via a memory pointer, much like the tape of a Turing machine.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Whirl’s two instructions are:</p>&#13;
<div class="bq5">&#13;
<p class="noindent"><strong>0</strong>  Reverse the direction of the active ring. If the previous instruction was 0, and it did not trigger an execution, then the currently selected command on the currently active ring is executed and the other ring becomes active.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><strong>1</strong>  Rotate the current ring in the current direction, either clockwise or counterclockwise.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">When the program starts, both rings are at the <span class="literal">Noop</span> position, both ring values are 0, and the operation ring is active. It’s the programmer’s job to track the current state of the program. There is no way to query ring alignment or which ring is active.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The original Whirl site is gone, but it is accessible via the Wayback Machine: <em><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130116204525/bigzaphod.org/whirl/">http://web.archive.org/web/20130116204525/bigzaphod.org/whirl/</a></em>. I’ve <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_425"/>taken the liberty of printing this site as a PDF. See <em>Whirl.pdf</em> on the book’s GitHub page.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Programming in Whirl is not for the faint of heart, but Whirl’s no Malbolge, either. For example, this Whirl program from the original website demonstrates again that 1 + 1 = 2:</p>&#13;
<pre>00   run ops.noop, switch to math ring&#13;
0    math::ccw&#13;
11   rotate to math.not&#13;
00   run math.not, switch to ops ring&#13;
00   run ops.noop, switch to math ring&#13;
0    math::cw&#13;
1111 rotate to math.store&#13;
00   run math.store, switch to ops ring&#13;
00   run ops.noop, switch to math ring&#13;
1    rotate to math.add&#13;
00   run math.add, switch to ops ring&#13;
00   run ops.noop, switch to math ring&#13;
0    math::ccw&#13;
1    rotate to math.store&#13;
00   run math.store, switch to ops ring&#13;
11   rotate to ops.one&#13;
00   run ops.one, switch to math ring&#13;
00   run math.store, switch to ops ring&#13;
0    ops::ccw&#13;
1111 rotate to ops.IntIO&#13;
00   run ops.IntIO, switch to math ring</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notice that <span class="literal">00</span> causes the current command on the current ring to execute, but a single <span class="literal">0</span> only toggles the direction of the current ring. At all times, <span class="literal">1</span> rotates the current ring in the current direction without executing a command. These are critical ideas for Whirl programming. Use <span class="literal">1</span> to set up the proper command on the current ring and then use <span class="literal">00</span> to execute the command and automatically toggle to the other ring. Lastly, use <span class="literal">0</span> to toggle the rotation direction for the current ring.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Several other examples gleaned from the original Whirl page are in the <em>examples</em> directory. There are additional examples in the <em>whirl-interpreter</em> directory as well.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Whirl is clever, and I strongly suspect it’s Turing complete because, in the end, it’s another imperative programming language, albeit one with a novel twist to it (pun intended). Go ahead, give Whirl a whirl.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2sec144"><strong><em>Taxi</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">As if Whirl weren’t clever enough, Sean Heber struck again with Taxi, a programming language where the programmer must navigate a taxi with up to three passengers around Townsville while maintaining enough gas and the funds to purchase it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_426"/>Like Whirl, the original Taxi site is gone but accessible from the Wayback Machine. For the URL, take a look at the <em>README.txt</em> file in the <em>Taxi</em> directory of the book’s GitHub repository. Taxi is marked as public domain, so I’m including it with the book. I also made a PDF of the archived web page (see <em>Taxi.pdf</em> ).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch16.xhtml#ch016fig3">Figure 16-3</a> shows Townsville (<em>taxi_map.png</em>).</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch016fig3" src="Images/16fig03.jpg" alt="Image" width="680" height="512"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 16-3: A map of Townsville</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Every location marked on the map is a possible destination, and each destination performs a different function. Driving the taxi requires fuel, so the programmer must be aware of how far the taxi has traveled and make pit stops when appropriate. Of course, this assumes that the taxi has collected enough in fares to cover the cost of the fuel. Passengers, either a number or a string, pay a flat rate of 0.07 credits per mile, but only pay when they have reached their destination.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Destinations implement the operations of the language. Need to add some values? Take your passengers to Addition Alley. Want a random integer? Pick one up at Heisenberg’s, but be prepared for a certain level of indecision on his part.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Some destinations implement data structures. Want a FIFO data structure? Visit Joyless Park or Sunny Skies Park. Prefer LIFO? Then use Narrow Path Park. Running low on gas? Better get to Zoom Zoom for the cheapest gas in town. Avoid Fueler Up if you can. You’ll pay too much. The complete list of destinations, and associated operations, is in <em>Taxi.pdf</em> . Enjoy the creative names.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_427"/>Taxi code is verbose, almost plaintext, much like the HyperTalk language used by HyperCard, an old Macintosh programming environment from Apple. For example:</p>&#13;
<pre>"Hello, World!" is waiting at the Writer's Depot.&#13;
Go to Writer's Depot: west 1st left, 2nd right, 1st left, 2nd left.&#13;
Pickup a passenger going to the Post Office.&#13;
Go to the Post Office: north 1st right, 2nd right, 1st left.&#13;
Go to the Taxi Garage: north 1st right, 1st left, 1st right.</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This prints, well, you know what it prints. The program begins with the taxi at the Taxi Garage and ends when the taxi returns to the garage. The first line puts a string at the Writer’s Depot, which holds a string constant. To use the string, you must first get to the Writer’s Depot from the Taxi Garage. To do that, you need to go west, take the first left, then the second right, then the first left, and, lastly, the second left. Consult <em>taxi_map.png</em>, and you’ll see that the directions do take you from the Taxi Garage to the Writer’s Depot.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The following line, <span class="literal">Pickup a passenger going to the Post Office</span>, gets the string with the intended destination. So use directions from the current location to get to the Post Office. The Post Office prints passengers to <span class="literal">stdout</span> (standard output). Pick up a passenger at the Post Office to get input from the user. To end the program, return to the Taxi Garage.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">What if you don’t return to the garage? The program ends poorly: <span class="literal">The</span> <span class="literal">boss couldn't find your taxi in the garage. You're fired!</span> So return to the garage, or else!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Flow control makes use of labels enclosed in square brackets and the <span class="literal">Switch</span> statement with references to the labels in quotation marks. For example, the line</p>&#13;
<pre>Switch to plan "loop".</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">is an unconditional branch to <span class="literal">[loop]</span>, while</p>&#13;
<pre>Switch to plan "end_loop" if no one is waiting.</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">is a conditional branch.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The C++ source code for Taxi is in <em>taxi.cpp</em>. I recommend commenting out the startup and exit messages at lines 472, 1267, and 1268. Or not; it’s a matter of personal preference.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To use Taxi, first build it with</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">g++ taxi.cpp -o taxi</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">and then run it:</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">./taxi examples/fib.taxi</span>&#13;
1.000000 1.000000 2.000000 3.000000 5.000000 8.000000 13.000000 ...</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Notice that Taxi supports floating-point numbers. Be sure not to miss Nick Turner’s RPN calculator in <em>rpn.taxi</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_428"/>Taxi is an excellent example of the esolang community’s unbounded creativity. It’s possible to imagine using Taxi, or something built from it, to introduce programming concepts. Of interest at a higher level is the fact that operations in Taxi come with a price: literally. Programmers are accustomed to operations having no intrinsic cost other than memory and time. In Taxi, the number of operations, and their relative relationship to each other, introduce another cost on top of the usual memory and time.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Development on Taxi has stalled, but the source code is in the public domain. Perhaps someone will pick it up, refine it, and introduce it again in another form. If targeting younger programmers, I suggest leaving out the travel cost aspect. What about a new metaphor? Perhaps an airplane flying from city to city, or a starship warping from star system to star system?</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2sec145"><strong><em>Dathanna</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The original Apple II+ computer from 1979 contained an 8-bit 6502 microprocessor running in a system with a 1 MHz clock, half of which was used to refresh RAM. By modern standards, the Apple II+ crawled along at continental drift speeds. However, modern computers are capable of emulating an Apple II+ at something approaching 100 times its native speed (84 times on my test system). This fact opens up new possibilities for programs written for the Apple II that would be far too slow on a native system but are entirely usable on an emulator running at full speed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Dathanna, Irish for “colors,” is just such a program. Dathanna is an esolang using colored blocks, two stacked one on top of the other, to specify commands. It echoes both Befunge-93 and Piet in how it operates. However, the most important part of Dathanna is that its interpreter is written in Applesoft BASIC and it runs off a disk image meant for Apple II emulators.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You’ll find Dathanna, along with all necessary files and documentation, on the book’s GitHub site. All I’ll present here is a bit of source code to whet your appetite: a program to estimate <em>π</em> using random numbers, much like we did earlier in the book with ABC. See <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch016fig4">Figure 16-4</a>, which should really be in color. Review the documentation to learn how it works.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="lev1sec106"><strong>Programming Language Resources</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">What follows is a prosaic but helpful list of resources to increase your knowledge of programming languages. I selected freely available material presented by the original authors when possible. Naturally, some of these URLs will fail over time, but the internet remembers, for good or ill. If a particular <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_429"/>link no longer works, searching for the title will likely locate the resource once more.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Programming languages tend to evolve slowly. If a few of the resources here are a decade or more old, that’s okay. The burning need to stay current is less critical in this case.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The following sections divide the resources into three groups. The first is a catch-all on programming languages in general. These resources are similar to what you typically encounter in an undergraduate course on programming languages. The second section covers data structures, which we unfairly neglected in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>. The third section relates to compilers and interpreters—the methods for actualizing a programming language.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The links are presented as title and URL with minimal comment. I reviewed all the material and found it helpful, though there are definite limits to what you can learn simply by reading. At some point, you have to go further and build something.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2sec146"><strong><em>Programming Languages</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The material here covers programming languages at an undergraduate level. As you read through it, recall the esolangs and other languages we discussed in the book to build connections with the more general concepts.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="h4" id="lev2sec147"><strong><em>Data Structures</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Data structures are tools used by programming languages to store and manipulate information. The form the structures take is a function of the elements provided by the programming language. The level of difficulty in implementing a particular data structure depends on the language used. Implementing a dictionary in Python is trivial because it’s part of the core language. Implementing a stack in Forth is trivial for the same reason. Pascal and C/C++ both provide syntactic support for records and structures. However, doing the same in Forth, at least in simple Forth systems, requires rolling your own data structures and directly managing a space of memory, often at the byte level.</p>&#13;

</div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2sec148"><strong><em>Compilers and Interpreters</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A programming language remains nothing more than a mental construct until an implementation actualizes it. Classically, implementation meant a compiler, as computers were generally too slow to make interpreted programming languages anything more than curiosities. Of course, this is no longer the case, and even simple interpreters are quite fast on modern hardware, to say nothing of the hybrid case of compiling a high-level language to code running on a virtual machine.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this section, you’ll find introductory material to help you learn about the process of building a compiler or interpreter. The latter is more straightforward, of course, but the former is definitely worth the effort, at least to understand the parts we discussed in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a> at a deeper level.</p>&#13;

<p class="noindent"><strong>An Introduction to Compilers</strong>  by D. Vermeir. Use this book as another reference to the main topics of compiler design. The example code is written in C. (<em><a href="http://tinf2.vub.ac.be/~dvermeir/courses/compilers/compilers.pdf">http://tinf2.vub.ac.be/~dvermeir/courses/compilers/compilers.pdf</a></em>)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><strong>Introduction to Compilers and Language Design</strong>  by Douglas Thain. This book serves as an alternative introduction to <em>Basics of Compiler Design</em> mentioned above. Take a look.

<p class="noindent"><strong>Compiler Construction Using Flex and Bison</strong>  by Anthony A. Aaby. Flex and Bison are classic compiler generation tools. While there are more current tools, this text includes the full source code for the Simple language. Use it as a case study in compiler design.

<p class="noindent"><strong>Programming Languages and Their Compilers</strong>  by John Cocke and J. T. Schwartz. This historical text, from 1970, details compilers as they existed then. Languages discussed include FORTRAN, LISP, and, a favorite of this book, SNOBOL.

<h3 class="h3" id="lev1sec107"><strong>Postlude</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You are still here at the end of the book and I thank you. I hope you had fun and learned things you didn’t know before. And I hope you’re excited about programming languages, especially the strange, weird, unusual, and esoteric kind.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I encourage you to develop your own programming language, even if you never implement it. There is something deeply satisfying about creating a new way to express thought. I suspect that for every implemented esolang, there are many more existing only as plans, notes, or vague notions. If you do nothing more than write it out on paper, and have fun doing it, then the language is worthwhile solely for the enjoyment its design brought.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_432"/>However, if you <em>do</em> implement it, let me know. I’d love to write some code for it.</p>&#13;

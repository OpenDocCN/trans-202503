<div class="image1"><img src="Images/common01.jpg" alt="Image" width="190" height="189"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This chapter outlines the digital forensics background knowledge assumed for reading the rest of the book. For some readers this will be an introduction; for others, a review. The history of digital forensics is described here together with some expectations for the coming decade. The current trends and challenges are discussed with a focus on digital forensic analysis of operating systems. The basic principles and industry best practices for computer forensic analysis are covered.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1_1"><strong>Digital Forensics History</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Some historical background about the field of digital forensics leading up to the present day will help explain how the field evolved and provide additional context for some of the problems and challenges faced by those in the forensics industry.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_2"/><strong><em>Pre-Y2K</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The history of digital forensics is short compared to other scientific disciplines. The earliest computer-related forensics work began during the 1980s, a time when practitioners were almost exclusively from law enforcement or military organizations. During the 1980s, the growth of home computers and dial-up bulletin board services triggered early interest in computer forensics within law enforcement communities. In 1984, the FBI developed a pioneering program to analyze computer evidence. In addition, the increase in abuse and internet-based attacks led to the creation of the first Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) in 1988. CERT was formed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and is located at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The 1990s saw major growth in internet access, and personal computers in the home became commonplace. During this time, computer forensics was a major topic among law enforcement agencies. In 1993, the FBI hosted the first of multiple international conferences for law enforcement on computer evidence, and by 1995, the International Organization of Computer Evidence (IOCE) was formed and began making recommendations for standards. The concept of “computer crime” had become a reality, not just in the United States, but internationally. In 1999, the Association of Chief Police Officers created a good practice guide for United Kingdom law enforcement handling computer-based evidence. Also during the late 1990s, the first open source forensic software, The Coroner’s Toolkit, was created by Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema. This software has evolved into today’s Sleuthkit.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_2"><strong><em>2000–2010</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">After the turn of the millennium, several factors increased the demand for digital forensics. The tragedy of September 11, 2001 had a tremendous effect on how the world viewed security and incident response. The Enron and Arthur Andersen accounting scandals led to the creation of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act in the United States, designed to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures. This act required organizations to have formal incident response and investigation processes, typically including some form of digital forensics or evidence collection capability. The growth of intellectual property concerns also had an impact on civilian organizations. Internet fraud, phishing, and other intellectual property and brand-related incidents created further demand for investigation and evidence gathering. Peer-to-peer file sharing (starting with Napster), along with the arrival of digital copyright legislation in the form of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, led to increased demand for investigating digital copyright violation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Since 2000, the digital forensics community has made great strides in transforming itself into a scientific discipline. The 2001 DFRWS Conference <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_3"/>provided important definitions and challenges for the forensics community and defined digital forensics as follows:</p>&#13;
<div class="bq">&#13;
<p class="noindent">The use of scientifically derived and proven methods toward the preservation, collection, validation, identification, analysis, interpretation, documentation, and presentation of digital evidence derived from digital sources for the purpose of facilitating or furthering the reconstruction of events found to be criminal, or helping to anticipate unauthorized actions shown to be disruptive to planned operations.<sup><a id="ch01foot01" href="footnotes.xhtml#ch01foot_01">1</a></sup></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">While the forensics community defined its scope and goal of becoming a recognized scientific research field, practitioner-level standards, guidelines, and best practices procedures were also being formalized. The Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence (SWGDE) specified definitions and standards, including the requirement of standard operating procedures for law enforcement. The 2000 IOCE Conference in France worked toward formalizing procedures for law enforcement practitioners through guidelines and checklists. The 13th INTERPOL Forensic Science Symposium, also in France, outlined the requirements of groups involved in digital forensics and specified a comprehensive set of standards and principles for government and law enforcement. Noted in <em>Proceedings of the 13th INTERPOL Forensic Science Symposium</em> in 2001, the US Department of Justice published a detailed first responders’ guide for law enforcement (“Electronic Crime Scene Investigation: A Guide for First Responders”) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Computer Forensics Tool Testing project (CFTT) wrote the first <em>Disk Imaging Tool Specification</em>.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_3"><strong><em>2010–2020</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In the years since 2010, multiple events have shifted the focus toward investigating and collecting evidence from cyberattacks and data breaches.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Wikileaks (<em><a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/">https://www.wikileaks.org/</a></em>) began publishing leaked material, including videos and diplomatic cables from the US government. Anonymous gained notoriety for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and other hacktivist activity. LulzSec compromised and leaked data from HBGary Federal and other firms.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The investigation of advanced persistent threat (APT) malware became a major topic in the industry. The extent of government espionage using malware against other governments and private industry was made public. The Stuxnet worm targeting supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems—in particular, control systems in the Iranian nuclear program—was discovered. Mandiant published its investigation of APT1, the cyber warfare unit of the Chinese Army. Edward Snowden leaked a vast repository of documents revealing the extent of NSA hacking. The release of Italy’s Hacking Team revealed the professional exploit market being sold <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_4"/>to governments, law enforcement agencies, and private-sector companies. The Vault7 leaks provided technical information about CIA hacking.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Major data breaches became a concern for private-sector companies, with data theft and credit card theft from Sony, Target, JP Morgan Chase, Equifax, Anthem, and others. The global banking industry faced major growth in banking malware (Zeus, Sinowal/Torpig, SpyEye, GOZI, Dyre, Dridex, and others), successfully targeting banking clients for the purpose of financial fraud. More recently, attacks involving ransoms have become popular (Ransomware, DDoS for Bitcoin, and so on).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This diverse array of hacking, attacks, and abuse has broadened the focus of digital forensics to include areas of network traffic capture and analysis and live system memory acquisition of infected systems.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Near the end of the 2010s, criminals started shifting toward social engineering over the internet. Technical exploitation was becoming more challenging with hardware manufacturers and operating system vendors placing more emphasis on secure defaults, and a shift toward cloud computing placing security controls with cloud providers. However, exploiting human trust remained effective, especially with cyber fraud. Attacks such as business email compromise (BEC) and CEO impersonation fraud were becoming common. I published a paper called “Fintech Forensics: Criminal Investigation and Digital Evidence in Financial Technologies”<sup><a id="ch01foot02" href="footnotes.xhtml#ch01foot_02">2</a></sup> that describes this landscape in detail.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_4"><strong><em>2020 and Beyond</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">It is worth giving a thought to the future of digital forensics, including the relevance of digital forensic analysis and Linux systems.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The increase in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, combined with recent hardware vulnerabilities, will drive the analysis of hardware forensic analysis. Crime scenes are becoming large collections of electronic devices, all of which have small amounts of local storage together with larger amounts of cloud storage. Many of these IoT devices are running embedded Linux systems.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this coming decade, we will likely see continued social engineering against people. Coupled with more accessible artificial intelligence, “Deepfakes” are poised to become the next generation of social engineering. These audio and video impersonations will become refined to the point where people will have difficulty noticing they are fake.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The COVID-19 health crisis caused a dramatic increase in online meetings, conferences, and human interaction. It also created a greater acceptance for employees working from home. Video conferencing and employee remote access became a normal part of society, which is driving the need for audio and video forensic analysis.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Fears of COVID-19 infection also accelerated the move away from physical money (bills and coins) toward cashless methods (such as contactless) <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_5"/>and mobile payments, creating an attractive target for criminals exploring new ways to commit financial fraud.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Cloud services will continue to replace local IT infrastructure in the enterprise and at home. Cloud providers will become attractive targets for criminals who will be able to access virtual infrastructure without the cloud tenant’s knowledge. A significant number of cloud providers use Linux systems as their platform of choice.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">New <em>financial technologies (FinTech)</em> using mobile devices, new payment systems (GNU Taler, for example), cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin), blockchain ledgers, and others will need to be analyzed for fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1_2"><strong>Forensic Analysis Trends and Challenges</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The field of digital forensics is constantly transforming due to the changes and advancements in technology and criminality. This is creating a need for new techniques in forensic analysis.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_5"><strong><em>Shift in Size, Location, and Complexity of Evidence</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Embedded Linux systems, specifically IoT devices, are proliferating. Additionally, Linux desktops are becoming as easy to use as their Windows and Mac counterparts, with fewer security and privacy concerns. Cheap netbooks and tablets based on Linux are becoming common on the market. This increased growth in the use of Linux is driving the need for Linux forensic analysis skills.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Access to Linux-based devices that use lock-down technologies (trusted computing, secure elements and enclaves), encryption, and embedded hardware are creating a challenge for analysis. In some cases, hardware forensics (chip-off, JTAG, and so on) may be the only way to extract data from embedded devices.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The rise of cloud computing on the client side (VDI technology) is causing an increase in the use of thin client devices based on Linux. The general-purpose operating system as we have known it is shifting toward a simple client device providing only a window to a cloud-based environment and a bridge to local hardware. Even the traditional concept of a “login” is disappearing as permanent connections to remote clouds become the norm.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Another change affecting forensic analysis is storage capacity. As of this writing, 18TB consumer hard disks are not uncommon, and enterprise solid state drives (SSDs) with more than 50TB capacity have been announced. These large disk capacities challenge traditional digital forensic analysis processes.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Another challenge is the multitude of storage devices that are being found at crime scenes or that are involved in incidents. What used to be a single computer for a household has become a colorful array of computers, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, external disks, USB thumb drives, memory cards, CDs and DVDs, and IoT devices that all store significant amounts of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_6"/>data. The challenge is actually finding and seizing all the relevant storage media as well as acquiring images in a manner that makes everything simultaneously accessible to forensic analysis tools.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The shifting location of evidence into the cloud also creates multiple challenges. In some cases, only cached copies of data might remain on end-user devices, with the bulk of the data residing with cloud service providers. The interaction between a client/user and a cloud provider will involve metadata such as access or netflow logs. Collecting this data can be complicated for law enforcement if it resides outside their legal jurisdiction and difficult for private organizations when outsourced cloud providers have no forensic support provisions in their service contract.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">IoT is a fast-growing trend that is poised to challenge the forensics community, as well. The wide variety of little internet-enabled electronic gadgets (health monitors, clocks, displays, security cameras, and so on) typically don’t contain large amounts of storage, but they might contain useful telemetry data, such as timestamps, location and movement data, environmental conditions, and so forth. Identifying and accessing this data will eventually become a standard part of forensic evidence collection.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Arguably, the most difficult challenges facing forensic investigators today are the trend toward proprietary, locked-down devices and the use of encryption. Personal computer architectures and disk devices have historically been open and well documented, allowing for the creation of standard forensic tools to access the data. However, the increased use of proprietary software and hardware together with encrypted data makes forensic tool development difficult. This is especially problematic in the mobile device space where devices may need to be “jailbroken” (effectively hacked into) before lower-level filesystem block access is possible.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_6"><strong><em>Multi-Jurisdictional Aspects</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The international cross-border nature of crime on the internet is another challenge facing forensic investigators. Consider a company in country A that is targeted by an attacker in country B, who uses relaying proxies in country C to compromise infrastructure via an outsourcing partner in country D, and exfiltrates the stolen data to a drop zone in country E. In this scenario, five different countries are involved, meaning the potential coordination of five different law enforcement agencies and the engagement of at least five different companies across five different legal jurisdictions. This multiple-country scenario is not unusual today. In fact, it’s rather common.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_7"><strong><em>Industry, Academia, and Law Enforcement Collaboration</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The increasingly complex and advanced nature of criminal activity on the internet has fostered increased cooperation and collaboration in gathering intelligence and evidence and coordinating investigations.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This collaboration between industry peers can be viewed as fighting a common enemy (the banking industry against banking malware, the ISP industry against DDoS and spam, and so on). Collaboration has also crossed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_7"/>boundaries between the private and public sectors, with law enforcement agencies working with industry to combat criminal activity in public–private partnerships. This multifaceted cooperation creates opportunities to identify, collect, and transfer digital evidence. The challenge is ensuring that private partners understand the nature of digital evidence and are able to satisfy the standards expected of law enforcement in the public sector. This will increase the likelihood of successful prosecution based on evidence collected by the private sector.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A third group that is collaborating with industry and law enforcement is the academic research community. This community typically consists of university forensic labs and security research departments that delve into the theoretical and highly technical aspects of computer crime. These researchers are able to spend time analyzing problems and gaining insight into new criminal methods. In some cases, they’re able to lend support to law enforcement where the standard forensic tools cannot extract the evidence needed. These academic groups must also understand the needs and expectations of managing and preserving digital evidence.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1_3"><strong>Principles of Postmortem Computer Forensic Analysis</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The principles of digital forensics as a scientific discipline are influenced by multiple factors, including formally defined standards, peer-reviewed research, industry regulations, and best practices.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_8"><strong><em>Digital Forensic Standards</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Compared to forensic acquisition, there are few standards for general-purpose operating system analysis. The operating system forensic analysis process tends to be driven by the policies and requirements of forensic labs and the capabilities of forensic analysis software. No international standards body defines how to perform operating system forensics in a way similar to NIST’s CFTT. General-purpose operating systems are too diverse, too complex, and too fast-changing to define a common standard procedure.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_9"><strong><em>Peer-Reviewed Research</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Another source for digital forensic standards and methods is peer-reviewed research and academic conferences. These resources provide the latest advances and techniques in the digital forensics research community. Forensic work based on peer-reviewed scientific research is especially important with newer methods and technologies because they may be untested in courts.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Several international academic research communities exist and contribute to the body of knowledge. <em>Digital Investigation</em><sup><a id="ch01foot03" href="footnotes.xhtml#ch01foot_03">3</a></sup> is a prominent scientific research journal in the field of forensics that has been publishing academic research from the field since 2004. <em>Digital Investigation</em> recently <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_8"/>joined the Forensic Science International (FSI) family of academic journals, signaling the inclusion of digital forensics among traditional forensic sciences. An example of a digital forensics academic research conference is the Digital Forensics Research Workshop (DFRWS).<sup><a id="ch01foot04" href="footnotes.xhtml#ch01foot_04">4</a></sup> DFRWS began in the United States in 2001 to create a community of digital forensics experts from academia, industry, and the public sector. DFRWS Europe was launched in 2014, followed by DFRWS APAC (Asia-Pacific) in 2021. The global expansion of DFRWS reflects the growth of digital forensics as an international scientific discipline.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Full disclosure: I am an editor for FSI’s <em>Digital Investigation</em> journal and also participate in the organizing committee of DFRWS Europe.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_10"><strong><em>Industry Regulation and Best Practice</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Industry-specific regulations may place additional requirements (or restrictions) on the collection of digital evidence.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the private sector, industry standards and best practices are created by various organizations and industry groups. For example, the Information Assurance Advisory Council provides the <em>Directors and Corporate Advisor’s Guide to Digital Investigations and Evidence</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Other sources include standards and processes mandated by legal and regulatory bodies; for example, the requirements for evidence collection capability in the US Sarbanes–Oxley legislation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Some digital evidence requirements might also depend on the industry. For example, healthcare regulations in a region may specify requirements for data protection and include various forensic response and evidence collection processes in the event of a breach. Telecommunications providers may have regulations for log retention and law enforcement access to infrastructure communications. Banking regulators also specify requirements and standards for digital evidence related to fraud (cyber fraud in particular). A good example is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS),<sup><a id="ch01foot05" href="footnotes.xhtml#ch01foot_05">5</a></sup> which provides detailed standards for the banking community in areas such as security and incident response.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Another influence is the growing area of cyber insurance. In the coming years, insurance companies will need to investigate and verify cyber insurance claims. Formal standards for analysis may be driven by insurance regulators and help contribute toward formalizing the analysis process.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The recent increase in cyberattacks, ransomware in particular, is targeting multiple sectors (finance, health, and so on) simultaneously. The need for standardized evidence collection and analysis will receive more attention from regulatory bodies in the coming years.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1_4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_9"/><strong>Special Topics in Forensics</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This brief section covers several special topics that don’t really fit elsewhere in the book but are worth mentioning.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_11"><strong><em>Forensic Readiness</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The concept of <em>forensic readiness</em> refers to advance preparation for performing digital forensic acquisition and analysis in the event of an incident. This need generally applies to organizations anticipating abuse and attacks against their own infrastructure. Forensic readiness may be a requirement by regulatory bodies (health sector, finance sector, and so on) or other commercial industry legislation (such as Sarbanes–Oxley). Forensic readiness may also be driven by industry standards and best practices or an organization’s own policies (driven by their risk and security functions).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Forensic readiness may include defining system configuration and logging requirements, organizational forensics capabilities (for example, a forensic team or outsourced partner company), having processes in place to perform forensic investigations and/or collect digital evidence, and arranging retainer contracts for external support. For larger organizations choosing to have in-house digital forensics capabilities, this will also include staff training and having adequate tools in place.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Forensic readiness generally applies to organizations that own their IT infrastructures themselves and can dictate preparedness. In the case of law enforcement, the IT infrastructure seized during criminal investigations is not controlled or known in advance. The forensic readiness available to public-sector forensic labs refers more to the staff training, tools, and processes in place to handle a variety of unexpected digital forensics work.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_12"><strong><em>Anti-Forensics</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The concept of <em>anti-forensics</em> or <em>counter-forensics</em> has become a topic of interest and importance in recent years. Much of the research and practitioner work in the area of digital forensics is publicly available, which means that it’s accessible to criminals who have an interest in protecting themselves and hiding their criminal endeavors.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Anti-forensic activity is not new and has been conducted since computer intrusions began. It is a cat-and-mouse game similar to what the antivirus community faces when trying to detect and prevent malware and virus activity.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Some anti-forensic activity is discovered through legitimate security research. Other anti-forensic activity is shared underground among criminal actors (though the methods typically don’t stay hidden for very long). The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_10"/>more information the digital forensics community has about potential anti-forensic activity, the better. If information about anti-forensic methods is publicly known, digital forensics researchers can develop tools to detect or prevent it. This will improve the reliability and integrity of digital evidence and protect the validity of decision-making by the courts.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Traditional anti-forensic techniques involve encrypting data on a drive or employing steganography to hide evidence. Systems owned by criminal actors employ “anti-forensic readiness” to ensure their systems are not logging and saving traces of evidence that investigators may find interesting.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Technical examples of anti-forensics include the manipulation or destruction of information, such as logs, or the manipulation of timestamps to make timelines unreliable. For example, programs like <em>timestomp</em> can reset the timestamps of all files and directories to zero (the Unix epoch, January 1, 1970). Cleaners and wipers are tools that try to destroy evidence of operating system and application activity on a hard drive (irreversibly deleting cache, history, temporary files, and so on). Some anti-forensic countermeasures are now being developed. A good Linux example is the systemd journal that provides forward secure sealing (FSS) to detect manipulation of logs.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the area of networking, anti-forensic examples include spoofing, relaying, anonymization, or dynamically generated web content. For example, targeted phishing websites can produce harmless content when viewed by certain IP address ranges in an attempt to thwart detection or takedowns.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Code obfuscation in malware (malicious JavaScript or binary executables, for example) is typically used to thwart reverse engineering efforts by investigators. Malicious code may also be designed to remain dormant when specific conditions appear. For example, it may refuse to install if the computer is a virtual machine (indicating possible anti-malware systems) or it may behave differently depending on the geographic region.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Forensic investigators must maintain a certain degree of skepticism when analyzing and interpreting digital evidence. Cryptographic validation or corroborating sources can be used to improve the authenticity and reliability of digital evidence. Throughout this book, warnings of potential anti-forensic risks will be mentioned where appropriate.</p>&#13;

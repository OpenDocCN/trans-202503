- en: Video games can be playful, weird, exciting, curious, magical, and even downright
    scary. We enjoy playing games because they act like windows into other worlds,
    worlds that move and change as we play with them, worlds whose rules are different
    than our own. (Sometimes these rules seem to make more sense than our world’s.)
    Games can be places we visit for a short time or places we get lost in for long
    stretches at a time. Through games, we can try on other personas and explore different
    perspectives.

- en: Games have been around *forever*, or at least since the start of civilization.
    In fact, our oldest ancestors made their own games out of sheep’s bones (the very
    first dice!). They used seeds and some holes in the dirt to make the game we now
    call *Mancala*. *Tic-Tac-Toe* was first played over 3,000 years ago in Egypt!

- en: 'Games existed long before other activities, such as writing, painting, and
    3D movies. It seems like people were born to *play*. Whenever a group of people
    agree to play by a certain set of rules, a new game is born. As these games pass
    on to new players, the new group puts its unique spin on it. For example, a *Tag*
    player might wonder, *Wouldn’t Tag be more exciting if you could rescue people
    who’ve been tagged?* And just like that, a new rule is born: games grow and change
    over time like weird plants.'

- en: Games that are designed by a group of people instead of just one person are
    called *folk games*. No one person invented *Tag*. More likely, *Tag* had a million
    different authors who each added their own little touches. This is why so many
    different versions of *Tag*, such as *Flashlight Tag*, *Freeze Tag*, and *Kick
    the Can*, exist today. All it took was someone to come up with another, more fun
    way to play the game, and the rest was history.

- en: The mobile games on your phones are *designer games*, which were made by a single
    person or a team of people. They aren’t folk games, but they’re still the result
    of people playing games and trying to come up with different ways to improve a
    game or create new games using their imagination.

    were called *mainframes*. Because computers were so expensive and complicated,
    only a few people could use them to make video games.'

- en: One of the oldest video games, *Spacewar*, was written by punching holes into
    paper cards and then putting the cards into a computer. After writing out the
    code on paper, you then had to figure out which holes to punch on a card so the
    computer could read and understand the cards. If any of the holes were wrong,
    you had to start over and repunch all the cards!

- en: As you can imagine, computers were very tricky to use back then. They were also
    so big and expensive that only schools could afford them. In fact, most of the
    video games made in the 1960s and 1970s were designed by students at universities,
    such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But these students were not being taught game design in school. They were being
    taught serious computer programming. However, in between classes, they snuck away
    to the computer labs and figured out how to make video games because they thought
    games were cool. They disguised their games as Serious Computer Programs because
    the administrators would delete any programs that looked like games, calling them
    a waste of space.

    Programs. Keep that idea in mind if someone complains about how much time you
    spend making games. People might forget the serious stuff, but they’ll usually
    play a game for a very long time.

    pocket—your smartphone—which can do so much more than a huge mainframe computer
    ever could and is much faster. These pocket-size computers are also less expensive
    and easier to use.

- en: People create video games for many different reasons. For example, maybe you’ve
    tried drawing comics, and it was fun. Maybe you’ve tried writing stories, and
    that was fun, too. Perhaps you enjoy arts and crafts as well as making music.
    Odds are, if you’re creative, you’ll also enjoy making games.
  prefs: []

    how they work. Making your own games is the best way to understand how game designers
    make decisions when they create your favorite games.

    new type of game no one has ever seen before—a game that is totally different
    from the currently available games. Gamers need to be challenged a little.

    thinking about it until it’s out of my head And the only way to get the idea out
    is to make it a reality. When I create a new game, it feels like I’m creating
    something I can share with the world. It feels awesome!

    the network of secret tunnels leading from your basement to the center of the
    Earth (you know about those, right?) and the monsters that live in them. And the
    picnics they have down there.

    blocks similar to LEGO blocks that snap together to tell your game characters
    what to do. Because the blocks snap together only in certain ways, it’s easy to
    tell where the blocks are supposed to go. Coding can be scary because sometimes
    your program might not work, and you’ll have no idea why. But Scratch’s snap-together
    system eliminates 90 percent of those situations.

    Scratch’s snap-together blocks are simple and easy to use, they use the same ideas
    as any other programming language. Whether you know how to use branching, variables,
    loops, and so on or need to learn, Scratch is a great introduction to all of these
    concepts!

<p class="noindent">What is few-shot learning? How does it differ from the conventional training procedure for supervised learning?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Few-shot learning</em> is a type of supervised learning for small training sets with a very small example-to-class ratio. In regular supervised learning, we train models by iterating over a training set where the model always sees a fixed set of classes. In few-shot learning, we are working on a support set from which we create multiple training tasks to assemble training episodes, where each training task consists of different classes.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev15"><strong>Datasets and Terminology</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In supervised learning, we fit a model on a training dataset and evaluate it on a test dataset. The training set typically contains a relatively large number of examples per class. For example, in a supervised learning context, the Iris dataset, which has 50 examples per class, is considered a tiny dataset. For deep learning models, on the other hand, even a dataset like MNIST that has 5,000 training examples per class is considered very small.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In few-shot learning, the number of examples per class is much smaller. When specifying the few-shot learning task, we typically use the term N-<em>way</em> K-<em>shot</em>, where <em>N</em> stands for the number of classes and <em>K</em> stands for the number of examples per class. The most common values are <em>K</em> = 1 or <em>K</em> = 5. For <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_16"/>instance, in a 5-way 1-shot problem, there are five classes with only one example each. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig1">Figure 3-1</a> depicts a 3-way 1-shot setting to illustrate the concept with a smaller example.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">Rather than fitting the model to the training dataset, we can think of few-shot learning as “learning to learn.” In contrast to supervised learning, few-shot learning uses not a training dataset but a so-called <em>support set</em>, from which we sample training tasks that mimic the use-case scenario during prediction. With each training task comes a query image to be classified. The model is trained on several training tasks from the support set; this is called an <em>episode</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, during testing, the model receives a new task with classes different from those seen during training. The classes encountered in training are also called <em>base classes</em>, and the support set during training is also often called the <em>base set</em>. Again, the task is to classify the query images. Test tasks are similar to training tasks, except that none of the classes during testing overlap with those encountered during training, as illustrated in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig2">Figure 3-2</a>.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_17"/></p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-2: Classes seen during training and testing</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig2">Figure 3-2</a> shows, the support and query sets contain different images from the same class during training. The same is true during testing. However, notice that the classes in the support and query sets differ from the support and query sets encountered during training.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There are many different types of few-shot learning. In the most common, <em>meta-learning</em>, training is essentially about updating the model’s parameters such that it can <em>adapt</em> well to a new task. On a high level, one few-shot learning strategy is to learn a model that produces embeddings where we can find the target class via a nearest-neighbor search among the images in the support set. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig3">Figure 3-3</a> illustrates this approach.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">The model learns how to produce good embeddings from the support set to classify the query image based on finding the most similar embedding vector.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_18"/></p>&#13;

<p class="number"><strong>3-1.</strong> MNIST (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database</a></em>) is a classic and popular machine learning dataset consisting of 50,000 handwritten digits from 10 classes corresponding to the digits 0 to 9. How can we partition the MNIST dataset for a one-shot classification context?</p>&#13;

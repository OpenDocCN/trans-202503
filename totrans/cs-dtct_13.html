<p class="noindent">What happened?” asked Officer Notation, who stood by the gate. Frank studied her as he tried to catch his breath. Was she concerned? Confused?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“We were attacked!” Socks blurted out. “We were trapped in a cell and everything was on fire! But I used a metal weakening spell so we could escape.” He looked quite pleased with himself.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Attacked?” asked Notation. “Who attacked you? Did you see them? What did they look like?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“No,” admitted Socks. “He snuck up behind me.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Frank?” asked Notation, turning to Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank shook his head. “All I saw was Socks flying at me.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I bet he was big,” offered Socks. “A giant thug. And he was stealthy. Maybe a trained assassin.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank rolled his eyes. “Sorry, kid. He was an amateur. Professional assassins don’t lock people in cells and run away.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“But the fire,” said Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Your staff started the fire,” Frank reminded him. “You dropped it on the papers.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Papers?” asked Notation. “Did you find the logs? Do you know what they were after?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_110"/>Frank and Socks looked at each other. Notation glanced from one to the other. Finally, Frank spoke, “The logs are gone. Our junior wizard here dropped his staff and <em>poof</em>—fire everywhere. Any clues are gone now.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Socks turned a deep shade of red and stared at the ground.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Gone?” asked Notation. “Everything’s gone? Are you sure?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Yeah,” said Frank. He nodded toward the smoke trickling from the door.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What about the person who attacked you?” asked Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I didn’t get a look at him,” said Frank. “I don’t suppose <em>you</em> saw anything?” he asked. The question came out sharper than he’d intended, but after being attacked, getting trapped in a burning room, and fleeing a darkened prison, he didn’t feel like pulling any punches.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“No,” she said calmly. “There was nothing around the front.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“No tracks near any of the doors?” asked Frank. “Anything that could give us a clue about our attacker?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation shook her head. “Nothing,” she said. “It looked as though no one had been around the other side in months.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank nodded, but didn’t speak. Something felt wrong. Either the attacker had cleverly slipped by Notation through the same gate they had used, or she wasn’t telling them something. How long had she been away from the gate? And why had she stayed outside? Frank decided not to press the issue. “All right. Let’s head back to the boat.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Now what?” asked Socks as they made their way toward the water.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Time to backtrack,” said Frank. “No more clues here.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Backtrack to where?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“The open clues,” Frank answered. “We investigate the leads we still have left.” He paused for a moment, weighing his options. “I think it’s time we parallelize the search.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Really?” asked Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_111"/>“Parallelize?” asked Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“It means we split up and explore different parts of the search space,” answered Notation. “Parallel algorithms divide up work and do that work in parallel—at the same time, that is. For example, the work might be distributed over different people. In this case, we can divide the leads into three sets. Then you, Frank, and I can each take a set of leads. We can investigate different leads at the same time, allowing us to work almost three times faster.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“But,” objected Socks, “I’m not an officer or a private investigator. I don’t know what to do. Shouldn’t I stay with one of you?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“No,” said Frank. “I’m still not sure what’s going on, but I have a feeling we’re working with limited time. Whoever we’re after knows we’re on the case now and knows we’ve tracked them this far. If they’re smart, they’ll start destroying the rest of the evidence.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“It’ll be late by the time we get back to Usb,” noted Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“We can split up tonight and meet at my office tomorrow morning,” said Frank. “That should give us enough time to follow leads and possibly grab some sleep.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Okay,” agreed Notation. “How do we divide up the work?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank knew the key to an efficient parallel algorithm was making sure that the benefit of using multiple workers was worth the cost of dividing up the work. Parallelizing work involves a certain amount of overhead. The problem needs to be broken into pieces. Each worker has to get a task, get ready to do it, and then actually do it. And then at the end, the work has to be recombined. Parallelizing a simple task can sometimes be more costly than just solving it outright. However, when the problem gets large enough, parallelization can greatly accelerate an algorithm.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Easy,” said Frank. “Socks, I need you to talk to your wizard friends. Ask them if they know about a group called the League of something. The thugs on the boat said they were working for a league before Rebecca Vinettee interrupted them. Judging by previous cases, the name will be something evil like the League of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_112"/>Power-Hungry Maniacs or the League of Darkness. Evil leagues tend not to be subtle with their names. Find out everything you can about this group.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“That’s not much to go on,” Socks complained.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Notation,” continued Frank. “I need you to pull all police transfer records for the last six months.” While he didn’t like the idea of leaving this lead to Notation, she was the only one who could get the records easily. If he tried to collect them himself, he would be met with suspicious looks and a small barricade of paperwork. The capital police department used paperwork with the same determination and effectiveness as roadblocks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Transfers?” asked Notation, clearly surprised. “Why?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Call it a hunch,” Frank lied. “We’ll meet at my office tomorrow morning and combine our information.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What about you?” asked Notation. Her voice now carried a note of irritation. She obviously knew Frank wasn’t telling her the whole story.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank gave her an innocent smile. “I have to go shopping.”</p>&#13;
<p class="center">_____________________</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As the <em>TCP Flyer</em> slowly cruised back to Usb, Frank found an out-of-the-way corner on the deck and sat down to think. This was the part of the investigation he hated most, when promising leads started drying up or, in this case, burning up. The loss of a crucial clue always filled Frank with a sense of dread—like he was running one step behind. Frank forced the doubts from his mind and refocused on the clues he did have. The voyage to Usb would give him time to comb through what he had seen and find connections he had missed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Oh. Sorry. Are you sleeping?” asked Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_113"/>“No. Thinking,” Frank said, and congratulated himself for not yelling. After all, the boy had saved his life.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When Socks didn’t say anything more, Frank prompted, “What do you want, Socks?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Um . . . I was curious about the search,” Socks responded.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“How so?” said Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To Frank’s dismay, Socks walked over and sat next to him.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Do you think we’ll find the criminals?” asked Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank shrugged. “We’ve still got some good leads,” he offered.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“But do you think we’ll be in time?” asked Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Alarm bells went off in Frank’s head. He swiveled and stared hard at Socks. “Time for what?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Socks nearly fell backward. His eyes darted around, as though searching for an appropriate answer. “Whatever they’re planning?” he finally stammered.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank didn’t buy it. “What else do you know?” he asked.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Nothing,” replied Socks. “At least, nothing concrete. It’s just speculation. Not mine—my mentor Gretchen’s. She has good insight into these types of things, though.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Which is?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I really shouldn’t say anything. It’s just speculation.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“<em>Which is?</em>” Frank growled.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“She thinks that whoever is behind this is going to attack the castle in a few days.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank leapt to his feet. “Why didn’t you mention this sooner?” he shouted.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“It’s just speculation,” repeated Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Unless it is a complete guess, she must have some reason,” said Frank. “Is it a guess?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“No. Not entirely,” said Socks. “It’s based on the stolen mask. Magical artifacts are most effective during the full moon, which is in two days.”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_114"/><img src="../images/f0114-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What exactly does this mask do?” asked Frank, starting to pace anxiously.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Socks hesitated for a moment. “It’s an incredibly powerful artifact,” he started. Upon seeing the angry look in Frank’s eyes, he sped up. “It’s officially called the Mask of Combinatorial Looks. It was lost hundreds of years ago during the Great Slug War. Everyone thought it was destroyed until Princess Ann recovered it during one of her quests. She found it—”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What does it <em>do</em>?” prompted Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“It allows the wearer to look like anyone else. The scholars believe that it uses a massively parallel search. Each feature runs its own search to find the best match. The nose will transform into a perfect match of the target’s nose. The eyes will transform into—”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“A perfect disguise,” offered Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Yes,” said Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank cursed. “And the castle? Why does Gretchen think they’ll attack the castle?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“She didn’t say,” admitted Socks. “Maybe that part <em>was</em> a guess,” he added without any real conviction.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank didn’t believe it either.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_115"/>“I’m sorry I didn’t mention it earlier,” offered Socks. “Since there isn’t any hard proof . . .” He trailed off, looking miserable.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What else aren’t you telling us?” asked Frank, staring down at Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Socks thought about the question for a long while before answering. “I think that’s it.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Everything?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Everything I know,” Socks qualified.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank took a deep breath and looked up at the sails, wishing they were fuller. The wind had died down within the last hour, and the <em>TCP Flyer</em> seemed to be barely inching toward their destination.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">He ran the timeline of the next few days through his head and wondered if they had enough time. Even with three of them searching in parallel, there was no guarantee they would cover enough ground. Worse, they couldn’t even begin the parallel search until the <em>TCP Flyer</em> docked. Until then, they were all stuck on the boat.</p>&#13;

<p class="sidebart"><strong>POLICE ALGORITHMS 101: PARALLEL ALGORITHMS</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="sbsub"><em><strong>Excerpt from Professor Drecker’s Lecture</strong></em></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A parallel algorithm breaks up a problem into multiple pieces, performs the computation on those pieces at (approximately) the same time, and then combines the results when all pieces are finished. It divides up the work among different workers, allowing them to complete the task faster than a single worker could. Consider our favorite example: searching an abandoned building for a suspect. The more officers you have, the more rooms you can check at the same time and the faster you can find the suspect. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_116"/>If you have 30 rooms and 30 officers, they can kick in all the doors at once.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The key to an efficient parallel algorithm is to efficiently divide the work into independent units and then recombine it. Some problems are trivial to parallelize. For example, if you are searching a large stack of scrolls for a particular clue, you can easily divide the work by giving each worker a subset of the scrolls.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">However, other algorithms are much more difficult or even impossible to parallelize. Even if you have 100 officers, you can’t question a suspect any faster. It’s an inherently serial problem. You need to base your next question on the suspect’s previous answers. And, perhaps more importantly, a suspect can answer only one question at a time. I’ve seen eight officers shouting questions at the same time. The interrogation doesn’t go any faster.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Another aspect to consider when parallelizing algorithms is whether the efficiency is even worth the overhead. A parallel algorithm requires additional setup time to divide the work, as well as completion time to merge the results back together. Individual tasks have to be assigned to different workers, often requiring some amount of communication. Consider the task of searching an unsorted array with only three values. By the time the setup is complete, a single person could have likely scanned through the array many times over.</p>&#13;

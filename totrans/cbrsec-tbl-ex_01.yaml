- en: In [Chapters 1](chapter1.xhtml) through [5](chapter5.xhtml), we will guide you
    through the tabletop exercise development process. This includes exploring the
    importance of tabletop exercises, the planning and development process, facilitation
    strategies, evaluation techniques, and steps to perform after the conclusion of
    your successful tabletop exercise. While every effort has been made to provide
    universally applicable guidance, you may need to provide minor alterations in
    order to align with your organizationâ€™s processes and cultural norms.

<p class="BodyFirst"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_30" title="30"/>Anybody interested in encryption and codebreaking should visit a museum of cryptology. In the United States, the best one is the National Cryptologic Museum, which is the doorway to NSA’s headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland. If you are in the United Kingdom, go to Bletchley Park, and in Germany, visit the Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum in Paderborn or the Deutsches Museum in Munich. These institutions exhibit fascinating cipher machines, such as the Enigma (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 15"><a href="c15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a></span>), as well as other crypto-related items.</p>
<p>Let’s turn our attention now to an object we found in the National Cryptologic Museum’s gift shop: a mug bearing an encrypted inscription (see <a href="#figure3-1" id="figureanchor3-1">Figure 3-1</a>).</p>

<p>The encryption algorithm used here is a variant of the so-called <em>pigpen cipher</em>. Also known in the last few centuries as the Freemason’s cipher, it is a very old and widespread enciphering technique.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-1" id="c03-noteref-1">1</a></sup> The following diagram shows how the pigpen cipher turns every letter of the alphabet into a symbol consisting of lines and dots:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="114" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03002.png" width="488"/></figure>
<p>Using this diagram, it becomes clear that the mug inscription decrypts to <code class="bold">NATEONAL SECURITY AGENCY</code>. (Yes, the first word contains a typo. Things like this happen, even at the NSA!)</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_31" title="31"/>There are many other variants of the pigpen cipher. For instance, the following text, written on a tombstone<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-2" id="c03-noteref-2">2</a></sup> from 1796 in New York City . . .</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="216" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03003.png" width="413"/></figure>
<p class="BodyContinued">. . . turns out to be encrypted in the following scheme:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="114" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03004.png" width="360"/></figure>
<p>The plaintext is <code class="bold">REMEMBER DEAAH</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, that second <code class="bold">A</code> should be a <code class="bold">T</code>, as clearly, the intended message was <code class="bold">REMEMBER DEATH</code>. Evidently, the stonecutter (or the tombstone designer) made a small typo, omitting the two dots! This is common in cryptography. Consider how easy it is to make typos in nonencrypted English text. The problem becomes even more pronounced with ciphertext, because it is more difficult to proofread. This can both add to and subtract from the level of difficulty for codebreakers.</p>
<p>There are many other pigpen cipher variations, such as those that change the order of the letters in the tables. For another variant, see the glossary in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix C">Appendix C</span> of this book. For an overview of crypto museums and other cryptologic sites around the world, check out the Cryptologic Travel Guide, a website operated by Klaus and the Austrian IT expert Christian Baumann, at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://cryptologictravelguide.com">https://cryptologictravelguide.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502727c03-0001"><a class="XrefDestination" id="Howsimplesubstitutioncipherswork"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c03-003"/>How simple substitution ciphers work</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The pigpen cipher and Caesar cipher are each examples of encryption methods that replace every letter of the alphabet with another letter or symbol. Ciphers of this kind are referred to as <em>simple substitution ciphers</em> or <em>monoalphabetic substitution ciphers (MASCs)</em>. A simple substitution cipher provides exactly one ciphertext letter for each plaintext letter.</p>
<p>There are two main types of simple substitution ciphers: one makes substitutions within the original alphabet, and the other transfers plaintext letters to characters in a different alphabet, which could be anything from a writing system such as the Cyrillic alphabet, to one invented by the user of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_32" title="32"/>the cipher, to a series of numbers, to a set of unusual symbols. The pigpen cipher is a simple substitution cipher of the <em>different-alphabet</em> type. So is the cipher that was used for the following text from <em>The Book of Woo</em>, as introduced in the webcomic<em> Sandra and Woo</em> in 2013:<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-3" id="c03-noteref-3">3</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-4" id="c03-noteref-4">4</a></sup></p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="112" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03005.png" width="642"/></figure>
<p>By contrast, the left-hand side of <a href="#figure3-2" id="figureanchor3-2">Figure 3-2</a> shows a message of the <em>same-alphabet</em> type. This is the title page of an encrypted book published in London in 1835.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-5" id="c03-noteref-5">5</a></sup></p>

<p class="BodyContinued">. . . this title decrypts to the text shown on the right side of the figure.</p>
<p>There are also mixtures of the two schemes. For instance, the following letter (sent in 1841 by one W.B. Tyler to Edgar Allan Poe,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-6" id="c03-noteref-6">6</a></sup> whom we will come back to in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 6"><a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a></span>) is written in both standard and nonstandard characters:</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_33" title="33"/><figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="126" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03006.png" width="343"/></figure>
<p>A different-alphabet simple substitution cipher can easily be changed into one of the same-alphabet type by randomly substituting every nonstandard character with a letter from the ordinary alphabet. This process is referred to as <em>transcription</em>, and the resulting text is called a <em>transcript</em>. For instance, the Voynich manuscript (covered in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 5"><a href="c05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a></span>), which uses a unique set of symbols (“Voynichese”), has been transcribed into the standard alphabet by several researchers in different ways.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-7" id="c03-noteref-7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>As an example of transcription, we can use the following message, which was published in Reddit’s Unsolved Codes forum in 2018 by a user named RetroSA, who said that he found it in his family’s personal effects.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-8" id="c03-noteref-8">8</a></sup> (It is still unsolved, by the way.)</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="200" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03007.png" width="499"/></figure>
<p>Another Reddit reader named NickSB2013 provided a transcript based on the following table:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="66" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03008.png" width="694"/></figure>
<p>Here’s the transcribed version of the cryptogram:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>ABCDE ABFGH ABIJKLMNO OPBD</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>OPNQAQRS ATRDH NVRDF: OSGA OQCEWKF T VFKO: PGA</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>DRQAPF OBRSADF EQWXF</code></p>
<p>Don’t be confused by the fact that the transcribed cryptogram starts with <code>ABCDE</code>. This is only because the Reddit reader transcribed the first letter appearing in the message as <code>A</code>, the second as <code>B</code>, and so on. </p>
<p>A transcribed message can be examined more easily than the original, especially if one uses a computer program. As it is possible to transfer a different-alphabet simple substitution cipher into a same-alphabet one, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_34" title="34"/>cryptanalysts usually don’t distinguish between the two. The methods used to attack a simple substitution cipher cryptogram do not depend on whether the ciphertext is written with standard letters or an alternate alphabet.</p>
<p>The American Cryptogram Association calls any same-alphabet simple substitution cipher that includes spaces (i.e., boundaries between words) an <em>Aristocrat</em>. Every issue of its newsletter, <em>The Cryptogram</em>, contains a number of Aristocrats for the user to solve. Other newspapers and magazines publish Aristocrats along with crossword puzzles and chess problems. In addition, books have been published that contain nothing but Aristocrats. Plenty of people seem to enjoy solving this kind of puzzle!</p>
<h2 id="h1-502727c03-0002"><a class="XrefDestination" id="Howtodetectasimplesubstitutioncipher"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c03-004"/>How to detect a simple substitution cipher</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">There is an easy, yet very useful, rule of thumb: in the overwhelming majority of cases, if a ciphertext is written in a nonstandard alphabet, its author used a simple substitution cipher (sometimes with a few additional tweaks). For instance, all the texts written in a pigpen alphabet we have ever encountered are encrypted this way—although it would be easy to use a pigpen alphabet along with another encryption method. Apparently, people who are clever enough to avoid a simple substitution cipher, opting for a more complex encryption system instead, also realize that using a nonstandard alphabet does not increase security.</p>
<p>There is, of course, no guarantee that a text written in a nonstandard alphabet is a simple substitution cipher. In order to make a more accurate diagnosis, we need frequency analysis and possibly other statistical methods. We’ll demonstrate this process with the encrypted postcard from 1909 depicted in <a href="#figure3-3" id="figureanchor3-3">Figure 3-3</a>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-9" id="c03-noteref-9">9</a></sup></p>

<p class="BodyContinued">. . . we create a transcribed version of the cryptogram. Note that the letters <code>U</code>, <code>V</code>, <code>W</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, and <code>Z</code> don’t appear in the transcript, as the alphabet used on the postcard only has eighteen letters:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>ABC DCEFG</code></p>

<p class="BodyCustom"><code>IJEHDO. EHHQ DCEFG</code></p>
<p>Next, we perform frequency analysis. The following report was created with the computer program CrypTool 2, but you can also figure out these frequencies manually or use the website <a class="LinkURL" href="https://dcode.fr/en">https://dcode.fr/en</a>. In this case, we are only interested in the percentage frequencies:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="162" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03010.png" width="694"/></figure>
<p>For comparison, here is a percentage frequency analysis of an ordinary English text:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="183" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03011.png" width="694"/></figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_36" title="36"/>If we look at the four most frequent and least frequent letters of the two texts, we get the following:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Ciphertext:    10.87, 10.87, 9.42, 7.97 / 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Plain English: 12.7,   9.1,  8.2,  7.5  / 0.75, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25</code></p>
<p>As you can see, there are some differences. For instance, the most frequent letter of the ciphertext has a share of 10.87%, compared to 12.7% in plain English. Apart from this, however, the numbers are quite similar. Overall, the encrypted text on the postcard is consistent with a simple substitution cipher applied to an English plaintext. Further examination shows that this is the case. This postcard is included as one of the challenges at the end of this chapter. Can you solve it?</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Let’s now look at the ciphertext in <a href="#figure3-4" id="figureanchor3-4">Figure 3-4</a>. This message is the first half of the encrypted inscription on the famous <em>Kryptos</em> sculpture at CIA headquarters, which we know does not use a simple substitution cipher (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 8"><a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a></span> and <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix A">Appendix A</span>).</p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure3-4">Figure 3-4</a>: The first half of the famous <em>Kryptos</em> sculpture does not have the statistical properties of a simple substitution cipher.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To prove this, here’s the percentage frequency analysis of this cryptogram:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="127" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03012.png" width="629"/></figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_37" title="37"/>Again, we look at the four most and least frequent letters and compare their frequencies to those in plain English:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Ciphertext:     7.18, 7.18, 6.71, 6.48 /  0.69, 1.39, 1.62, 1.85</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Plain English: 12.7,  9.1,  8.2,  7.5  /  0.75, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25</code></p>
<p>As you can see, the differences are now a lot greater. Compared to plain English, the most frequent letters of this cryptogram are too rare, while the rare ones are too frequent. The cryptogram’s frequency distribution is a lot flatter than that of English text in general. This indicates that the first half of the <em>Kryptos</em> inscription is not encrypted using a simple substitution cipher. We will come back to this famous cryptogram in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 8"><a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a></span>.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502727c03-0002"><a class="XrefDestination" id="Index-of-coincidencetechnique"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c03-006"/>Index-of-coincidence technique</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Whenever we have access to a computer, we can use another statistical method to make an educated guess about whether a certain ciphertext was created with a simple substitution cipher or not: the <em>index of coincidence</em><em> (IC</em><em>)</em>, which we define as the probability of two randomly chosen letters from a text being the same. (Other sources may describe IC differently.) The details of this important codebreaking tool are in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix B">Appendix B</span>. For the time being, know that the IC of an English plaintext encrypted using a simple substitution cipher is usually about 6.7%, while for pure random text, it is about 3.8%.</p>
<p>As calculating the IC is a laborious process to do by hand, in this example, we use the website <a class="LinkURL" href="https://dcode.fr/en">https://dcode.fr/en</a>, which provides an IC calculator. Applying this tool on the postcard message . . .</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="keyline" height="180" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03013.png" width="429"/></figure>
<p class="BodyContinued">. . . and on the <em>Kryptos</em> text, we receive the following values:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li>Index of coincidence of the postcard message: 6.4%</li>
<li>Index of coincidence of the <em>Kryptos</em> text:	  4.5%</li>
</ol>
<p>The IC of the postcard text (6.4%) is pretty close to what we would expect for English text encrypted with a simple substitution cipher (6.7%), while the IC of the <em>Kryptos</em> text (4.5%) is further from it. This confirms the (correct) conjecture that the postcard is encrypted with a simple substitution cipher, while the <em>Kryptos</em> encryption is not.</p>

<li>The word <code>KHE</code> (which we can also write as <code>KH</code><code class="bold">E</code>, as we already know that <code>E</code> probably stands for <code class="bold">E</code>) appears fourteen times in the cryptogram.

<li>The word <code>KS</code> (<code class="bold">T</code><code>S</code>) appears five times in the text.

<img alt="" class="keyline" height="158" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03017.png" width="694"/></figure>
<p>As you can see, among all the words contained in an English dictionary, only <code class="bold">ADDENDA</code> and <code class="bold">REENTER</code> fit this pattern. Which one might be correct? We can answer this question by looking at the frequency analysis calculated above. If <code class="bold">ADDENDA</code> were correct, <code class="bold">D</code> would be the most frequent letter in our text. In the case of <code class="bold">REENTER</code>, it would be <code class="bold">E</code>. The latter is by far the more likely case. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_41" title="41"/>Knowing that <code>VEERKEV</code> stands for <code class="bold">REENTER</code> thus gives us the potential plaintext equivalents of four letters. We could then substitute those potential plaintext equivalents throughout the ciphertext, then proceed to guess short words such as <code class="bold">THE</code>, <code class="bold">TO</code>, and <code class="bold">OUT</code> or look for more words with rare letter patterns.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Gary Klivans, our colleague and an expert on encryption methods used by gangs and prison inmates (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 2"><a href="c02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a></span>), is the author of the fascinating 2016 book <em>Gang Secret Codes: Deciphered</em>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-12" id="c03-noteref-12">12</a></sup> Gary provided us with an interesting encrypted note—a letter written by a New Jersey prison inmate to his girlfriend (see <a href="#figure3-6" id="figureanchor3-6">Figure 3-6</a>).<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-13" id="c03-noteref-13">13</a></sup> We have no further information about the background of this message.</p>

</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_42" title="42"/>As can be seen, the sender of this note used a nonstandard alphabet (probably of his own invention). Provided that this letter is likely encrypted using a simple substitution cipher, transcribing the text and performing a frequency analysis might be a good start to breaking it. However, Gary usually avoids the tedious process of transcribing and prefers guessing words based on letter patterns. When he combed through the ciphertext, he found the following word, which appears twice and seemed like a good candidate:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="166" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03018.png" width="273"/></figure>
<p>Gary’s guess was that it stood for <code class="bold">HOLLA</code> (a slang word with a similar meaning to “hello”). We will see that his suspicion was not entirely correct, but it proved helpful anyway. Based on his assumption, Gary could immediately identify the indefinite article <code class="bold">A</code>, which appears a few times in the text. As there is only one other common English word consisting of one letter, the pronoun <code class="bold">I</code>, the symbol representing it was easy to find, too (see the framed symbols in lines 1, 6, and 9):</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="243" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03019.png" width="389"/></figure>
<p>Gary then tried to guess the following pair of words:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="123" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03020.png" width="368"/></figure>
<p>Transcribed, the symbols are <code class="bold">OA***A* *OO****</code>, a unique pattern. Gary’s guess was that these were the words <code class="bold">OATMEAL COOKIES</code>, which proved correct. At this point he knew enough letters to easily decipher the whole text <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_43" title="43"/>(which was when he realized that the word he had first tried to decipher was not <code class="bold">HOLLA</code>, but <code class="bold">GONNA</code>). Gary finally came up with the following substitution table:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="57" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03021.png" width="694"/></figure>
<p>This leads to the following plaintext (note the two appearances of GONNA in the seventh and eighth lines):</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>WELL BEAUTIFUL,</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code> </code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>JUST FINISHED EATING LUNCH, HAD CHICKEN PATTIES, THEY</code></p>

<p class="BodyCustom"><code>I LOVE YOU!!! YOUR GONNA BE MY WIFE,</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>. . .</code></p>
<p>As far as we can tell, this is an ordinary love letter without any criminal content. The sender probably encrypted it because it contains intimate information—not because he wanted to hide something illegal.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Our colleague Kent D. Boklan is a New York–based professor of computer science and a successful codebreaker focusing on US encryptions from the nineteenth century. In addition to several Civil War ciphertexts from the 1860s, he has deciphered encrypted passages from a diary written by a doctor during the War of 1812.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-14" id="c03-noteref-14">14</a></sup> These successes are all described in articles Kent published in the scientific journal <em>Cryptologia</em>. Another broken cipher he reported in 2014 came once again from a diary.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-15" id="c03-noteref-15">15</a></sup> This diary was written by a Confederate soldier named James Malbone during the US Civil War. While most of Malbone’s diary is in cleartext, a few passages are encrypted. Here is one of the encrypted parts:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="174" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03022.png" width="519"/></figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_44" title="44"/>Between the cleartext expressions <code class="bold">Three</code> and <code class="bold">March 11th 1863</code>, Malbone wrote a few lines of ciphertext in a nonstandard (probably self-invented) alphabet. Kent supposed that Malbone had used a simple substitution cipher. The first ciphertext word consists of three letters: <code>*.£</code>. On a different page, Kent found a similar word at the end of a paragraph: <code>?*.£</code>. (In the picture below, the cleartext in the two lines above this expression is <code class="bold">May the Lord bless + be with you in my prayer.</code>)</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="183" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03023.png" width="519"/></figure>
<p>If we transcribe these two words (ignoring the rest of the ciphertext), we get <code>BCD</code> and <code>ABCD</code>. Kent realized that <code class="bold">AMEN</code> might be a good candidate for the last word of a paragraph that talks about a prayer. If this assumption were correct, the first plaintext word in the cryptogram would be <code class="bold">MEN</code> and the text would start with <code class="bold">Three MEN</code>. This made sense.</p>
<p>Knowing the letters <code class="bold">A</code>, <code class="bold">M</code>, <code class="bold">E</code>, and <code class="bold">N</code>, Kent could easily decipher the rest of the encrypted passages. The two ciphertexts shown above decrypted to the following plaintexts:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Three MEN WERE PUPLICLY WHIPT @ WHIPPING</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>POST BEFOR THE WHOLE BRIGADE March 11th, 1863</code></p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Beatrix Potter (1866–1943) was an English writer and illustrator best known for her classic 1902 children’s book <em>The Tale of Peter Rabbit</em>. Around the age of fourteen, she began to keep an encrypted diary, using a monoalphabetic cipher of her own devising. She wrote in this diary for fifteen years.</p>
<p>In 1952, nine years after Potter’s death, a relative of hers found the encrypted diary.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-16" id="c03-noteref-16">16</a></sup> As she couldn’t make sense of it, she consulted Beatrix Potter enthusiast Leslie Linder, who immediately became interested and started to work on deciphering the diary. Though Potter’s encryption method was a pure monoalphabetic cipher, the codebreaking work proved difficult. Potter’s writing was small, sometimes tiny, with thousands of words squeezed onto some of the pages (see <a href="#figure3-7" id="figureanchor3-7">Figure 3-7</a>).</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_45" title="45"/><figure>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure3-7">Figure 3-7</a>: Beatrix Potter, author of the famous 1902 children’s book <em>The Tale of Peter Ra</em><em>bbit</em>, kept an encrypted diary.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>On one page, Linder found two cleartext (unencrypted) expressions that proved very helpful: the Roman numeral <code class="bold">XVI</code> and the year <code class="bold">1793</code>. In a history book, he read that the French king Louis XVI was guillotined in 1793. This enabled him to decrypt a word he found nearby as <code class="bold">execution</code>. Linder then knew the symbols for eight letters of the alphabet, including four vowels. By the end of the same day, he had solved practically the whole of Potter’s cipher alphabet. The real labor, however, had just begun. It took Linder thirteen years to decode all the diaries.</p>
<p>Linder was painstaking in his work, careful to decipher everything correctly. If Potter wrote of a plant, Linder checked with a botanist. When she described a work of art, he verified her thoughts by consulting art books and exhibition catalogs. In addition, he would trace Potter’s journeys on a map or even travel to the particular places himself. In 1966, Linder’s results were published in a book titled <em>The Journal of Beatrix Potter: 1881–1897</em>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-17" id="c03-noteref-17">17</a></sup> Here’s the substitution table he derived:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="166" src="image_fi/502727c03/g03024.png" width="527"/></figure>
<p>In his book, Linder writes that the excerpt shown in <a href="#figure3-7">Figure 3-7</a>, from April 9, 1886, decrypts as follows:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Snow here. fog. What is to be done for the poor in such weather? Sunday March 13th.—Old Gladstone got a cold. Convenient method of ruminating on Irish measure for the 1st. of April. I don’t think any one expects it to come. Mr. Bright in London, in good health and spirits. Mr. Roth his son-in-law got into the Reform, it was feared he would not, Mr. Bright being very unpopular there.</code></p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_46" title="46"/>Potter was far from the only person to keep an encrypted diary.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-18" id="c03-noteref-18">18</a></sup> One thing of note for those who may wish to crack a diary belonging to their own ancestors is that it is very difficult to write large amounts of text with a complicated cipher. It therefore comes as no surprise that nearly all of the encrypted diaries we know of used simple substitution ciphers, though perhaps with some additional expressions here and there to make writing easier. In Potter’s case, she used <code>2</code> for the words <code class="bold">to</code> and <code class="bold">too</code>, as well as <code>3</code> for <code class="bold">the</code>. As a rule of thumb, the more handwritten encrypted text you see, the easier it will be to solve.</p>

<p>The three lines of cleartext on the card contain the name and the location of the newspaper, as well as the expression <code class="bold">CELEBRITY CYPHER</code>. A <em>celebrity cypher</em> (today usually spelled <em>celebrity cipher</em>) is a crypto puzzle (typically an Aristocrat) that, once deciphered, turns out to be a quote by a famous person. Celebrity ciphers are quite popular among the members of the American Cryptogram Association and other puzzle enthusiasts. There are entire books and web pages dedicated to celebrity ciphers. Elonka’s book <em>The Mammoth Book of Secret Codes and Cryptograms</em> contains scores of them.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-26" id="c03-noteref-26">26</a></sup></p>
<p>The copycat postcard message (referred to as the Zodiac Celebrity Cypher) has never been solved. It is, of course, possible that it encrypts a quote by a famous person, but we don’t know this for sure.</p>

There are several web pages providing information about the Zodiac Celebrity Cypher, some of which even suggest alleged solutions.

<p>The script in which this postcard is written is a mystery of its own. It could be an ordinary, yet rarely used, writing system or an invented, secret script. It could also be a kind of shorthand, except that some of the letters (e.g., the triangle-shaped symbol) are not well suited for speedy writing. At least we can tell that the author wrote fluently and was practiced in using these glyphs. Transcribing this cryptogram is difficult, as some letters are written on top of each other. Numerous skilled codebreakers, including fans of Klaus’s blog, tried their luck on this message without success. Perhaps a reader can shed light on this unusual secret?</p>

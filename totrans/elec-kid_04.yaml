    can wind that wire into a coil. The coiled wire acts like a group of wires, and
    when the magnetic field passes through it, a current flows through each coil,
    creating more power than you could with a straight wire.

    copper wire, and connect the short leg to the nail, as shown. The LED should now
    light up.

- en: Lemons aren’t super powerful batteries (you’d never see anyone with a lemon
    connected to their computer, for example), so your LED will probably be very dim.
    After you finish building your lemon-powered circuit, turn off the light in your
    room, and you should see the LED glow.

    eat them!

- en: When you’re done making lemon batteries, test to see whether you can make batteries
    out of other fruits or vegetables. For example, what about a potato battery? Are
    you able to get more voltage, or is it the same as the voltage from the lemon?

- en: If you can’t see light from your LED, even in a dark room, check to see whether
    your LED is connected the right way. The long leg should be connected to the positive
    side of the battery, which is the copper wire.

- en: Make sure the lemons are connected to each other only through the wires and
    nails. For example, if your lemons are sitting in a puddle of lemon juice, they
    could be connected through that. Just dry them off and move them somewhere else.
    Next, check that the copper wires are properly connected to the nails and that
    the nails and copper wires are actually touching the juice inside the lemons.
    Also, check that the nails and copper wires are not touching each other inside
    any of the lemons.

    other. Then, use a multimeter to check that each lemon battery has some voltage.
    Connect two lemons in series, and check that you see a higher voltage. Connect
    the third lemon, and check that the voltage has increased again. Then, connect
    the fourth lemon and check that you have even more voltage.

- en: If you see a voltage but the LED doesn’t light, then you probably just need
    some more power. Get another lemon or two, create some more batteries, and connect
    them in series with the rest.

    and chemical reactions. You made your own shake generator, and you built a lemon
    battery to power an LED.

    from an old bike. Unlike the generator you built in this chapter, a dynamo is
    a generator that gives you a DC voltage, like a battery, and dynamos are commonly
    used to power headlights on bikes. Cut some windmill blades out of some stiff
    cardboard or plastic, connect them to the dynamo, and see whether you can harvest
    energy from the wind.

    In the following chapters, you’ll learn about even more components and graduate
    to building some real electronic circuits, like lights that blink, a touch-sensitive
    switch, and even your own electronic musical instrument!

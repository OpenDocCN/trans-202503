- en: At this point, having read about (and I hope built) the 70 projects in this
    book, you should have a much deeper and broader understanding of electronics and
    the Arduino environment, along with the knowledge and confidence required to create
    more complex and useful Arduino-based projects.

- en: You’ve learned to interface with a wide variety of devices outside the Arduino
    ecosystem via data buses and different forms of wireless communication, including
    Bluetooth and the Telegram instant-messaging platform. With your newfound skills,
    you might build devices that control mains outlets via the internet, create web
    interfaces to monitor sensor data, add MP3-quality audio to your projects to generate
    user notifications, use watchdog timers to improve project operation reliability,
    and much more.

    includes the tools discussed in this book, as well as others that we didn’t cover
    but still find useful. Although this isn’t a complete catalog of the many options
    you could include in your IoT hacking arsenal, it can act as a guide for getting

    with I²C, SPI, JTAG, and UART. The main downside to it is that the headers don’t
    come pre-soldered. It’s based on FT232H, which is the chip that Attify Badge,
    the Shikra, and Bus Blaster use (although the Bus Blaster uses the dual channel
    version, FT2232H). You can get it at [https://www.adafruit.com/product/2264](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2264).

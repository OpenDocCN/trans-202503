    rendered on a screen and blurred to make it look like you’re flying through them.
    Stars far away move slowly, and those close to you zoom by. Many people know of
    this effect from the Windows 3.1 screensaver, but it’s been around since at least
    the late ’70s. In this project, we’ll create a starfield demo using a 32 × 32
    LED matrix, with a SmartMatrix SD Shield to act as intermediate hardware between
    the microcontroller and the LEDs. This shield microcontroller handles most of
    the complexity involved in driving all those LEDs.'

    that are close should be brighter and move faster than the stars that are far
    away. All of the stars should move radially out from the center.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To make the starfield effect in software, we’ll create a list of stars and randomly
    distribute them as points in 3D space with a coordinate system. We’ll represent
    each point as three coordinate values, like (*x*, *y*, *z*), where *x* represents
    the horizontal axis, *y* represents the vertical axis, and *z* represents depth.
    You can imagine *z* as the distance from you—the higher the *z* value, the farther
    away the point will appear. Our *eye*, the default point in the 3D space, is at
    the origin, or (0, 0, 0).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once we’ve completed our list of randomly placed stars, we have to overcome
    the problem of drawing a point in 3D space on a 2D display. Imagine drawing a
    region of space as a four-sided pyramid with the top and bottom cut off. This
    is called a *view frustum* and is illustrated here.

    This means that a point at (0, 0, 0) is in the middle of the display, a point
    at (–8, –8, 0) is in the middle of the lower-left corner, and a point at (8, 8,
    0) is in the middle of the top-right corner of the LED panel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also need to account for the *z* distance. A point at (8, 8, 100) shouldn’t
    be drawn in the middle of the top-right corner of our LED panel. It should be
    closer to the middle of the display than the point (8, 8, 0), because it is farther
    away from the camera. In other words, the x- and y-coordinates need to move closer
    to the eye as the z-coordinate gets bigger.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To translate from 3D coordinates to our 2D coordinates, we divide each of the
    x- and y-coordinates by *z*. Try thinking about the 2D coordinates as percentages
    of the total frame size at that particular depth (or *z*). Dividing the x- and
    y-coordinates by *z* gets us a 45-degree angle on our frustum edges, so that for
    every step in *z*, we can see an additional step in *x* and *y*. We can experiment
    with different factors, like dividing by double *z*, or dividing by half of *z*,
    and that changes the slope of the edges of our view frustum.

    brightness of the LED is relative to the distance: the stars that are the farthest
    away from us are at the minimum brightness, and the stars that are at the front
    of the frustum in the very center are at the maximum brightness. To make it simpler
    in the program, we scale based only on the z-value.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Phew! The programming is much shorter than the explanation! Now that we know
    how to draw the stars on our display, we need to move! We want to fly through
    the stars, but instead of moving the eye forward in *z*, we’re going to move all
    the stars toward the eye in *z*. It makes the programming easier. Once a star
    advances past our eye, we certainly can’t see it anymore, so we’ll recreate it
    back at the maximum distance away from us.

    information in our sketch. Structs can make it easier to see the intent of your
    code by grouping related information together. We make a bunch of star structs
    at the beginning of the program. When a star has advanced behind our eye or outside
    our viewing range, we randomize that star’s coordinates and then set it far away
    from us so we can encounter it again ➋. This lets us reuse the structs rather
    than needing an infinite quantity.

    The Arduino doesn’t have a real random-number generator, so we initialize the
    system by reading a disconnected pin at ➍ to get different pseudorandom numbers
    each time. Reading a disconnected pin is not a very good “random seed,” so if
    you run it multiple times you may see it start up the same way. There are ways
    to make this more random, but we’ve kept it simple for clarity.

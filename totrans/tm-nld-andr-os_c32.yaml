    on the tripod and fire the gun faster than you could normally, because he had
    a more powerful motor.”

    guard was posted outside. The electricians cut out the drywall behind the plate,

- en: Behind the wall plate was . . . nothing. It was just a USB port embedded in
    the wall. It was a prank. Or, rather, it was engineers (specifically, Brian Jones,
    Joe Onorato, and Bruce Gay) with more hardware than plans. They carefully cut
    a hole in the drywall, and with a mixture of hot glue and inspiration, they inserted
    a USB port borrowed from an old workstation. Bruce added a label to make it look
    more official. They had no plans for anything more elaborate; they just thought
    it was funny sitting there, doing nothing. Google Security didn’t share that feeling.

    especially around Brian Jones’s desk. So Joe and Brian scrounged around for the
    parts that resulted in a switch to control the internet.

    the switch to buzz (the team found some haptic hardware to make the plate vibrate
    when it was switched off).

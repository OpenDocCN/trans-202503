<p class="chapterintro">Batch is an ideal tool for interrogating Windows directories. What files or types of files are in a directory? Are some directories filling up? Where’s a lost file? You can answer such questions and many more with some Batch code.</p>
<p class="tx">In this chapter, you’ll learn how to create directories, delete directories, and retrieve a plethora of information about existing directories. Before long, you’ll be able to quickly generate a report detailing the contents of a directory, including filenames, subdirectories, and all the contents of any subdirectories. The information can include the size, last modified date, and attributes of all files, or even just select files. Eventually, you’ll learn how to process these files and directories one by one in a bat file, but I’ll start by sharing how to retrieve this useful data. I’ll also explore how to easily determine the existence of a specific file or file mask.</p>
<p class="tx">Finally, you’ll learn how to map local and network directories to drive letters. Nearly anyone who works on a Windows computer can alleviate some day-to-day drudgery and become more efficient with a few tips from this chapter coded into a simple bat file.</p>

<p class="tni">A <i class="calibre6">directory</i> is a mapped location on a computer’s disk drive that can house files and other directories or subdirectories. On a Windows computer, a directory is represented by a folder; in fact, the terms <i class="calibre6">directory</i> and <i class="calibre6">folder</i> are often used interchangeably. In Windows Explorer, you can create and delete subdirectories and files in a directory with just a few mouse clicks. You can do the same with a bat file, maybe more easily.</p>

<h4 class="h1" id="sec2"><span id="h2-38"/><span class="sans_futura_std_heavy_oblique_bi_">Creating Directories</span></h4>
<p class="tni">To create a directory, Batch uses the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">md</span> and <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">mkdir</span> commands. Both stand for <i class="calibre6">make directory</i>, and they’re actually the same command (Batch synonyms).</p>
<p class="tx">The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">md</span> command accepts no options, and its only argument is the directory to be created:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">md C:\Batch\MakeMe\</code></pre>
<p class="tx">This useful yet simple command accepts multiple directories to be created, but when you use a single command for each directory, the return code of each command clearly tells you which directories were and were not successfully created. The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">md</span> command works with or without the trailing slash, but I recommend using it, for no other reason than its presence makes the argument look like a directory.</p>

<h4 class="h1" id="sec3"><span id="h2-39"/><span class="sans_futura_std_heavy_oblique_bi_">Deleting Directories</span></h4>
<p class="tni">The counterpart to the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">md</span> command is the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">rd</span> command, for <i class="calibre6">remove directory</i>, which deletes a directory and any files that might be in it. It also has a Batch synonym, <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">rmdir</span>, and it has only two options, both of which I always use: <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/Q</span> invokes <i class="calibre6">quiet</i> mode, and <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/S</span> deletes any <i class="calibre6">subdirectories</i> and their contents:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">rd /Q /S C:\DeleteMe\</code></pre>
<p class="tx">This command also accepts one-to-many directories as arguments, with or without a trailing slash. If there are no subdirectories, the command works with or without the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/S</span> option, but if there’s one or more subdirectories, nothing at all is deleted without the option. I haven’t yet been able to conceptualize what it means to delete a directory but not its subdirectories, so I always use the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/S</span> option.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="sec4"><span id="h1-97"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Retrieving Directory Information</span></h3>
<p class="tni">Batch has two commands for retrieving detailed information about directories and the files they contain, one far more useful than the other. I’ll start with the indispensable one.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec5" epub:type="division">
<h4 class="h1" id="sec5"><span id="h2-40"/><span aria-label=" Page 143. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_143" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="sans_futura_std_heavy_oblique_bi_">The dir Command</span></h4>
<p class="tni">One immensely helpful tool is the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span> command, which is short for <i class="calibre6">directory</i>. Many will use it at the command prompt to display information to the console. When used alone in a bat file, that information is simply dumped to stdout, which usually means it’s subsumed by everything else contained in stdout, so it isn’t all that useful. However, you’ll typically use the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span> in one of two fashions.</p>
<p class="tx">First, with what you learned in <span class="xref"><a href="chapter12.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 12</a></span>, you can redirect the output of the command to a file to be read by a program, a human, or eventually a bat file. Second, and even more impressive, I’ll show how to feed the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span> command into a <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">for</span> command, skipping the step of creating the file. That’ll come in <span class="xref"><a href="part2.xhtml" class="calibre3">Part II</a></span>, but before you use <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span> in a <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">for</span> command, you need to understand the complexities of the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span> command itself.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec6" epub:type="division">
<h5 class="h2" id="sec6"><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Without Options</span></h5>
<p class="tni">The simplest <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span> command accepts a single argument: a directory or folder. The double quotes are optional if the path has no embedded spaces:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">dir "C:\Important Stuff\"</code></pre>
<p class="tx">For the purpose of demonstration, assume that this directory holds electronic copies of some important personal documents and a couple of subdirectories with other important stuff. The result of the command might be the nicely formatted report written to stdout shown in <a href="#Lis13-1" class="calibre3">Listing 13-1</a>.</p>

<p class="listingcaption"><span class="futura_std_book_oblique_i_">Listing 13-1: Sample output of an optionless dir command</span></p>
<p class="tx">After three header lines, the first two <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">&lt;DIR&gt;</span> entries signify that this is a subdirectory and not a root folder associated with a drive letter; these two lines don’t appear for the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir C:\</span> command. More interesting, all of the files in this folder are clearly shown, each with its last modified date and time along with the file size. Subdirectories are also clearly delineated.</p>
<p class="tx"><span aria-label=" Page 144. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_144" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Notice that the files and subdirectories are intermingled, sorted alphabetically by default, but as you’ll soon see, this command is extremely customizable with its options, giving you much control over this output.</p>
<p class="tx">You can even list multiple directories in a single command:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">dir "C:\Important Stuff\" C:\Batch\</code></pre>
<p class="tni">This command displays all the files and subdirectories under the first folder, followed by similar information for the second folders under another heading: <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Directory of C:\Batch</span>.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="sec7" epub:type="division">
<h5 class="h2" id="sec7"><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Some Useful Options</span></h5>
<p class="tni">The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span> command has no shortage of useful options; a couple options even have options of their own. I’ll discuss the ones I’ve used often, but as always, find the full list in the help, <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir /?</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/O</span> option controls the sort <i class="calibre6">order</i>, but it works a little differently from most options you’ve seen at this point. Additional characters define the sort order. For instance, <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/OG</span> groups the directories before the files, and a dash reverses the sort order so that <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/O-G</span> groups the files before the directories. (Painfully, <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">G</span> represents <i class="calibre6">group directories first</i>.) The option <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/OEN</span> orders by <i class="calibre6">extension</i> and then by <i class="calibre6">name</i>, while <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/O-E-N</span> reverses the order. Some may find it <i class="calibre6">odious</i>, but <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/ODS</span> sorts by modified date and time followed by file size:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">dir "C:\Important Stuff\" /ODS</code></pre>
<p class="tx">The <i class="calibre6">attributes</i> option, <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/A</span>, limits what’s displayed. The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/AH</span> option lists only hidden files, while <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/A-H</span> omits hidden files from the list; <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/AD</span> shows only directories, while <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/A-D</span> doesn’t display directories. There really should be an option for files only, but the no directories option accomplishes the task as only Batch can.</p>
<p class="tx">By default, the file sizes are displayed with commas, which is great for readability (for humans), but if we want to do any arithmetic on these numbers, the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/-C</span> option removes the commas. Quite often, the coder wants to produce a simple list of filenames without any clutter. The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/B</span> option, which stands for <i class="calibre6">bare</i>, does the job nicely.</p>
<p class="tx">Putting a few of these options together, the following command skips the directories (<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/A-D</span>), orders by size from smallest to largest (<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/OS</span>), and shows only the filenames sans their respective paths (<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/B</span>):</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">dir "C:\Important Stuff\" /B /A-D /OS</code></pre>
<p class="tx">This command without any options produced the report in <a href="#Lis13-1" class="calibre3">Listing 13-1</a>. With these options, the result is far more succinct, just a simple list of filenames:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11"><span aria-label=" Page 145. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_145" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Passport.png
SSI Card.png
Car Title.pdf
Birth Certificate.jpg
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">Notice from <a href="#Lis13-1" class="calibre3">Listing 13-1</a> that the passport is the smallest file and the birth certificate is the largest, thus showing that the files are still ordered by size even though their byte counts aren’t displayed. The succinct output might look like a downgrade; true, it isn’t as informative for humans, but in <span class="xref"><a href="part2.xhtml" class="calibre3">Part II</a></span> this will be ideal data to feed into a <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">for</span> command that’ll process one file at a time.</p>
<p class="tx">Another useful option is <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/S</span>, which stands for <i class="calibre6">subdirectory</i>. It essentially runs a <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span> command on a directory, and then it runs it again on all of its subdirectories, returning a well-formatted report with subheadings for each. The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir C:\ /S</span> command provides a report on every folder on your computer, but it won’t be quick, and the result will likely be longer than this book. When used in conjunction with <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/B</span>, each bare filename is prepended with its path—which might seem like a contradiction but not after you consider that each file could be in any number of directories.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec8" epub:type="division">
<h5 class="h2" id="sec8"><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Default Set of Options</span></h5>
<p class="tni">If you’re planning to run multiple <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span> commands, all with the same options, those options don’t need to be repeated for every command. Instead, you can load one or more options into the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dircmd</span> pseudo-environment variable. Once it’s set, all subsequent <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span> commands will use the options in the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dircmd</span> variable by default.</p>
<p class="tx">For example, the following code executes both <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span> commands showing bare filenames (<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/B</span>), no directories (<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/A-D</span>), and sorted by extension (<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/OE</span>):</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">set dircmd=/B /A-D /OE
dir "C:\Important Stuff\"
dir "C:\Some Other Folder\"
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">You can override one or more of the options in the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dircmd</span> variable for a particular <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span> command. Assume that the next <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span> command follows the previous code where <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dircmd</span> was set:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">dir "C:\Important Stuff\" /O-E</code></pre>
<p class="tni">This still uses the options for the bare format of files only, but the sort order is reversed.</p>
<p class="tx">At any point, you can turn this feature off by setting <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dircmd</span> to null or nothing at all.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="sec9" epub:type="division">
<h4 class="h1" id="sec9"><span id="h2-41"/><span class="sans_futura_std_heavy_oblique_bi_">The where Command</span></h4>
<p class="tni">The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">where</span> command is similar to the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span> command; it searches one or more directories to find <i class="calibre6">where</i> a file exists. If you’re shrugging your shoulders as <span aria-label=" Page 146. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_146" role="doc-pagebreak"/>you read this asking, “Doesn’t the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span> command do that and a whole lot more?” my answer would most definitely be in the affirmative. Most anything you can do with <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">where</span>, you can do with <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span>, only better.</p>
<p class="tx">However, the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">where</span> command performs one task far more efficiently than the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span> command ever could. With the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/Q</span> option, the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">where</span> command returns an exit code indicating success or failure in lieu of a list of files found, making it easy to determine whether a particular file exists or whether at least one file matching a file mask is present. (The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/Q</span> option stands for <i class="calibre6">quiet</i> mode like some others you’ve seen, but quiet for this command means something slightly different. For the others, a prompt is suppressed, but here the output is suppressed.)</p>
<p class="tx">The following command looks for at least one file starting with the text <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">FindMe</span>, case-insensitive, in the folder <i class="calibre6">C:\Batch\</i> and sets <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">errorlevel</span> based on the result:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">where /Q C:\Batch\:FindMe*</code></pre>
<p class="tni">The return code will be <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">0</span> if at least one file fits the mask, <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">1</span> if not, or <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">2</span> if the syntax is incorrect.</p>
<p class="tx">If you look closely, there appears to be a problem with the path and file mask; there’s what looks to be an extraneous colon between the two. The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span> command rightly accepts a path and filename (or mask) together as one argument. The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">where</span> command treats them as separate arguments delimited by a colon. This does allow you to enter multiple semicolon-delimited paths with a single filename or mask, but that’s of little consolation. To make matters even more confusing, the colon is dropped in favor of a space when using the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/R</span> option—which stands for <i class="calibre6">recursive</i>, meaning that it also searches subdirectories:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">where /Q /R C:\Batch\ FindMe*</code></pre>
<p class="tx">I’m begrudgingly including this command. The syntax is just plain wrong, but it does have one worthwhile function. Think of it as an <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">if exist</span> command with a return code. Use it for this narrow task, but otherwise stick with the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span>.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="sec10"><span id="h1-98"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Mapping Drive Letters</span></h3>
<p class="tni">Batch has two very useful commands for mapping drive letters. One maps local paths to drive letters, and the other maps network paths and shares to drive letters. If you’re a noncoder—first off, I’m giving you a slow clap, congrats on getting to the 13th chapter—but more to the point, if this sounds like something that only coders can use, that isn’t the case.</p>
<p class="tx">Mapping paths is a great tool if you often work in various specific paths on your computer or network throughout the day. Navigating to them might take some time, especially if these paths are several folders deep. Another challenge, especially if you work from home, is that you probably <span aria-label=" Page 147. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_147" role="doc-pagebreak"/>won’t be able to see the network paths until you connect to a virtual private network (VPN). To make all of this easier, write a short bat file and run it each morning, perhaps after connecting to the network, and you can access these paths with ease throughout the day. After the mapping is done, access each path by clicking a drive letter in Windows Explorer.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec11" epub:type="division">
<h4 class="h1" id="sec11"><span id="h2-42"/><span class="sans_futura_std_heavy_oblique_bi_">The subst Command</span></h4>
<p class="tni">The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">subst</span> command maps a local directory, or any folder on your Windows computer, to a drive letter. The command name is short for <i class="calibre6">substitute</i> because after using it, you can substitute a drive letter for a directory. (No, it isn’t used for substringing.) The following command maps <i class="calibre6">Z:\</i> to the path shown, although it’ll fail if the path doesn’t exist or if the drive letter is already mapped to another path:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">subst Z: C:\ParentFolder\ChildFolder\GrandchildFolder\</code></pre>
<p class="tx">After this command executes, you’ll find <i class="calibre6">Z:\</i> in Windows Explorer as an alias of the <i class="calibre6">C:\ParentFolder\ChildFolder\GrandchildFolder\</i> path. Now the bat file can access anything in that path by invoking only the drive letter. For example, after the previous command executes, the following command creates an empty file in the <i class="calibre6">GrandchildFolder\</i> directory, with an economy of typing:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">copy nul Z:\EmptyFile.txt</code></pre>
<p class="tx">The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">subst</span> command with neither arguments nor options displays all folders currently mapped by earlier <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">subst</span> commands. If a certain other folder had already been mapped prior to the earlier <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">subst</span> command, the succinct command</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">subst</code></pre>
<p class="tni">might generate the following output:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">Y:\: =&gt; C:\Certain\Other\Folder\
Z:\: =&gt; C:\ParentFolder\ChildFolder\GrandchildFolder\
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">The mapping of <i class="calibre6">Z:\</i> will now be in effect on the machine, even to other processes (bats and humans alike) until the machine is logged off or unless the following command is run to <i class="calibre6">delete</i> or disconnect the mapping via the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/D</span> option:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">subst Z: /D</code></pre>
<p class="tx">This command maps only local directories; it doesn’t map directories on other computers, but there’s another command for that.</p>

<p class="tni">The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">net use</span> command maps network directories and shares as the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">subst</span> command maps local directories. The following command maps <i class="calibre6">Y:\</i> to a share on a remote server:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">net use Y: \\RemoteServer\ShareName\</code></pre>
<p class="tx">You can now use the drive letter <i class="calibre6">Y:\</i> to access this path on another machine, again by both bats and humans, until the mapping is deleted or the machine is shut down. Like the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">subst</span> command, <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">net use</span> has an option to disconnect or delete the mapping, but it’s more verbose:</p>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">net use Y: /DELETE</code></pre>
<p class="tx">The creators of the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/D</span> and <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/DELETE</span> options were at least subconsciously honoring the famous quote, “a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.” Ralph Waldo Emerson might disapprove, but in a nod to foolish consistency, I’ve capitalized the verbose option as I have the others because that’s my convention, but not without reservations. My primary driver behind this convention is to minimize capitalizations, but when an option, which is usually a single character, grows to six characters, it begs to be lowercase. Do what feels right to you.</p>
<p class="tx">Much like the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">subst</span> command, the command with no additional arguments, <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">net use</span>, produces the complete list of directories and drives mapped by earlier <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">net use</span> commands.</p>

<p class="warning-txt"><i class="calibre6">I need to head off some hate mail here. This is actually the net command with use being its first argument. The command has more than a dozen other first arguments—for instance, share creates a file share. But due to the popularity of use, coders commonly refer to the net use command. In fact, the help, net use /?, details information on it like any other command.</i></p>

<h3 class="h" id="sec13"><span id="h1-99"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Summary</span></h3>
<p class="tni">In this chapter, you learned how to create and delete directories. I detailed the all-important <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dir</span> command, which you’ll see again before long, and the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">where</span> command, which you’ll not see again in this book because of reasons stated earlier. You now can pull up an incredible amount of information on a directory and all of its contents, and in <span class="xref"><a href="part2.xhtml" class="calibre3">Part II</a></span>, I’ll demonstrate how to enumerate through this data so that you can perform a task on each file or directory. You also learned how to map local and network directories, a skill that’s incredibly useful for anyone, not just coders, who works often on a Windows computer.</p>
<p class="tx">Changing gears, I’ll next delve into the concept of escaping. To some this might be the most confusing title in the book; what’s escaping, what’s being escaped, and what are we trying to escape? Those questions and more will be answered in the next chapter.</p>

<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="OpenerCap"><img src="Images/Alphabet-I.png" alt="Alphabet-I" class="dropcap"/></span>n the last chapter, you saw that computers can be trained to recognize different characteristics of writing. For that project, you trained an ML model to recognize compliments and insults. Computers can also learn to recognize lots of other styles of writing as well.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="104" id="Page_104"/>For example, you can train an ML model to recognize the differences between formal writing and casual writing in the same way—by training it to recognize patterns in the words that people choose and the phrasing they use. </p>
<p>Different newspapers and news websites use words and phrases in different ways to describe the same stories. In this chapter, you’ll train a computer to recognize the way that language is used in media by creating an ML model that can identify the type of newspaper a headline has come from (see <a id="figureanchor8-1" href="#figure8-1">Figure 8-1</a>). </p>

</figure>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="h1-500563c08-0001">Build Your Project</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The aim of this project is to see whether a computer can learn to recognize the way that newspapers use language. For the screenshots in this chapter, I trained an ML model to recognize headlines from <em>tabloids</em> (smaller newspapers with gossip stories and lots of photos) compared to <em>broadsheets</em> (traditional, full-size newspapers with more serious articles). </p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="105" id="Page_105"/>You can do the same topic as well, or you can design your own project. If you choose to design your own project, you should choose <em>one</em> characteristic to train the computer to recognize. There are lots of things that you could investigate. For example, you could base your project on the following:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li><span class="RunInHead">UK newspapers (versus US newspapers)</span>  Do American newspapers use language differently than British newspapers?</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">Headlines in the summer (compared with winter headlines)</span>  Are the front-page headlines written differently at different times of year?</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">National newspapers (versus local newspapers)</span>  Are the headlines in national papers written differently than the headlines in your local paper?</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">Weekend headlines (versus weekday headlines)</span>  Do newspapers use language differently on work and school days than on the weekend?</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">Articles from two different newspapers </span>  If you pick two specific newspapers, can you train the computer to recognize an article from one of them?</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">Headlines from the 1950s (compared with headlines today)</span>  Are headlines written differently today from how they used to be?</li>
</ol>
<p>You’ll need examples of the types of newspaper articles or headlines that you want to train the ML model to recognize. There are lots of websites you can use to find examples. Here are a few suggestions:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li><a href="https://www.thepaperboy.com/" class="LinkURL">https://www.thepaperboy.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ukpressonline.co.uk/" class="LinkURL">https://www.ukpressonline.co.uk/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.time.com/vault/" class="LinkURL">https://www.time.com/vault/</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Think about what comparison you would find interesting and then see if you can find enough examples to make it easy to do.</p>
<p>You’ll need two groups to train the ML model: </p>
<ul>
<li>Examples of the type of newspaper article/headline that you want the model to recognize</li>
<li>Examples of newspaper articles/headlines that <em>don’t</em> have that characteristic</li>
</ul>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="106" id="Page_106"/>Try to change only one characteristic in the second group. For example, the category <em>headlines from UK tabloids in the 1970s</em> has three variables: country (UK), newspaper type (tabloids), and time period (1970s). What would you put in the second group? </p>
<p>You could fill it with examples of headlines from US tabloids in the 1970s, so the computer learns to recognize the difference between 1970s UK and US tabloid headlines. Or, you could fill it with examples of headlines from UK tabloids from today, so the computer learns to recognize the difference between UK tabloid headlines from the 1970s and now.</p>
<p>What you should <em>not</em> do is use, for example, headlines from current US broadsheets. That would change all three variables, which would make it harder for the model to recognize a consistent pattern.</p>

<h2><span class="NoteHead">Note	</span></h2>
<p>Choose <em>one thing</em> that you want the computer to learn to recognize and try to keep everything else the same in both groups of examples. </p>
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>
</section>
</aside>
<p>As another example, if you want to train the computer to recognize the way that articles are written in the <em>Daily Times</em>, in the second group you could include articles from different newspapers from the same day. Even better, you could try to pick articles about the same subject. Then your ML model won’t be learning to recognize the article subject, but rather the patterns in the way the<em> Daily Times</em> describes the same subjects.</p>
<p>To train my ML model to recognize headlines from tabloids, I compared examples of tabloid headlines with headlines from broadsheet newspapers. Here’s what I kept the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>I used newspapers from the <em>same time period</em>: March 2015 through April 2015.</li>
<li>I used the <em>same section</em> of each newspaper: the headline in the biggest text on the front page. </li>
<li>I used the <em>same type</em> of newspapers: national, weekday newspapers.</li>
<li>I used newspapers from the <em>same country</em>: the UK.</li>
</ul>

<p class="BodyFirst">Accuracy is a useful measure, and possibly the most well-known one. But it’s often not enough, so it’s normally not the only measure used for real-world ML systems.</p>
<p>Can you think of any problems with accuracy?</p>
<p>What if my ML model thought that everything was a headline from a broadsheet newspaper, as in <a id="figureanchor8-22" href="#figure8-22">Figure 8-22</a>?</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure8-22" href="#figureanchor8-22">Figure 8-22:</a> Classifying every headline as broadsheet </p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The accuracy would be 50 percent, as the model would put all 10 broadsheet newspapers in the right place but all 10 tabloid newspapers in the wrong place.</p>
<p>But “50 percent accuracy” isn’t a good description of a system that gives the same answer to any question. We need a better way to describe our ML model’s performance, one that avoids this sort of misleading result.</p>
<p>A <em>confusion matrix</em>is a tool where you count the number of things that the ML model gets correct and the number of things that it gets wrong and then arrange those results in a table. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="122" id="Page_122"/>Create four more variables with <b>for all sprites</b> selected and name them <code class="bold">true positive</code>, <code class="bold">true negative</code>, <code class="bold">false positive</code>, and <code class="bold">false negative</code>.

<p>It’s a useful way to describe the performance of an ML model that tells us more than accuracy can by itself.</p>
<p>If my ML model thought everything was from a broadsheet newspaper, the confusion matrix would look like <a id="figureanchor8-28" href="#figure8-28">Figure 8-28</a>.</p>

<h3 id="h2-500563c08-0005"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="126" id="Page_126"/>Measuring Performance: Precision and Recall</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Another way that we describe the performance of ML models is using <em>precision</em><em/> and <em>recall</em><em/>.</p>
<p>Precision is calculated as <code class="bold">true positive / (true positive + false positive)</code>.</p>
<p>Recall is calculated as <code class="bold">true positive / (true positive + false negative)</code>.</p>
<p>You can update your script to include the calculations shown in <a id="figureanchor8-29" href="#figure8-29">Figure 8-29</a>. Add them to the end of the <code class="bold">when I start as a clone</code> script for the second sprite, after the <code class="bold">say</code> block.</p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure8-29" href="#figureanchor8-29">Figure 8-29:</a> Calculating precision and recall in Scratch </p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I added this calculation to the script for my ML model. <a id="figureanchor8-30" href="#figure8-30">Figure 8-30</a> shows the results I got.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/f08030.png" alt="f08030"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure8-30" href="#figureanchor8-30">Figure 8-30:</a> Displaying precision and recall in Scratch</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="127" id="Page_127"/>The precision score means that when my ML model thinks something is a tabloid headline, it is right 78 percent of the time.</p>
<p>The recall score means that it found 70 percent of the tabloid headlines in the test set.</p>
<p>The accuracy score means that 75 percent of the answers the ML model gave were correct.</p>
<p>Precision, recall, and accuracy all help to give a good description of an ML model’s performance. </p>
<p>For example, <a id="figureanchor8-31" href="#figure8-31">Figure 8-31</a> shows results from two different ML models that both have an accuracy score of 50 percent. The other scores help to describe the differences in the way the models are working.</p>

<p>In comparison to the way we tested your project in the last chapter, which was by manually entering test values and getting a feel for how many times the model is correct, using measurement values is a more consistent and effective way to describe the performance of ML models. We’ll look at another use of performance measurements for image recognition projects in the next chapter.</p>
<h3 id="h2-500563c08-0006">Improving Your ML Model</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Try adding another 10 examples to each of your two training buckets from the Train phase and use them to train a new ML model from the Learn &amp; Test phase.</p>
<p>Rerun your Scratch script once the new ML model has finished training.</p>
<p>What does the increased number of training examples do to your precision, recall, and accuracy scores?</p>
<h2 id="h1-500563c08-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="128" id="Page_128"/>What You Learned</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">You’ve seen from all of your own projects that ML isn’t perfect and can make mistakes. ML doesn’t need to be perfect to be useful, however. ML systems make up for their mistakes by working so quickly, analyzing massive amounts of text that would take a lifetime for a person to read. Even if it makes mistakes 10 percent of the time, an ML system can still be useful at finding things that need attention. But it’s important to know how many mistakes an ML system is making to measure how well it is performing.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you learned that there are many ways of testing ML systems and measuring how well they’re performing, which can help us decide how to use the results they give us.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, you’ll learn about solving more complex problems by breaking them up into separate pieces for an ML model to recognize, and you’ll use a confusion matrix again to see how well this works.</p>

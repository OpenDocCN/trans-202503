<p>This penchant for robotics and gadgets of all types played itself out in early Android in different ways.</p>
<p>One robotics project Andy worked on was a barista; he built a robot to create latté art. It’s not clear if he got it completely working, but there was an area in one of the upstairs micro-kitchens in building 45 that housed an odd-looking machine. The area was roped off for protection (of potential customers<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c33-footnote-1" id="c33-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup>).</p>

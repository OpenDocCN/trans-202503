- en: Digital camera technology in 2003 was becoming interesting; digital single-lens
    reflex cameras (DSLRs) combined high-quality lenses with increasingly large sensors
    to capture more and more detail in digital image files. But the software for these
    cameras was . . . not great.

- en: Andy Rubin, who had founded and recently left the mobile phone manufacturer
    Danger, was looking for a new project. Along with Chris White, a former colleague
    at WebTV, he started a new company to make better camera software. With Andy as
    CEO and Chris as CTO, they founded FotoFarm in late 2003 to provide an operating
    system for digital cameras. The software they envisioned would enable better UIs
    and networking, along with the ability to run apps. Combined with superior camera
    hardware, they would push the boundaries of photographic and imaging functionality
    and experience.

  zh: 安迪·鲁宾曾创办并刚刚离开了手机制造商Danger，他在寻找新的项目。与前WebTV同事克里斯·怀特一起，他们成立了一家公司，目标是制作更好的相机软件。安迪担任CEO，克里斯担任CTO，他们在2003年底创立了FotoFarm，为数码相机提供操作系统。他们设想的软件将提供更好的用户界面和网络功能，还能运行应用程序。结合更强大的相机硬件，他们将推动摄影和成像功能与体验的极限。
- en: Chris told Andy he thought they could come up with a better name than “FotoFarm.”
    Andy already had the URL android.com, so they changed the name to Android and
    hired the design firm Character to help create their corporate identity, including
    their logo and business cards.

- en: Andy invited Nick Sears to meet with him at Android’s offices in Palo Alto to
    pitch the camera OS. The two had worked closely together on Danger’s phone, the
    T-Mobile Sidekick. Nick had decided to leave T-Mobile, but to continue working
    on mobile phones. He wanted to build a consumer smartphone that went beyond what
    they had been able to build at Danger. Nick felt that one of the reasons Danger
    hadn’t succeeded as much as they’d hoped was the interface and form factor of
    the device itself. “Everybody looked at it as this iconic device, but we knew
    that the form factor wasn’t small enough yet that people wanted to carry it in
    their hands. It was still a thick device and had to have the screen as a separate
    thing.”

  zh: 安迪邀请尼克·西尔斯到Android位于帕洛阿尔托的办公室，向他推销相机操作系统。两人曾在Danger的T-Mobile Sidekick手机项目中紧密合作过。尼克决定离开T-Mobile，但仍希望继续从事手机领域的工作。他想打造一款比他们在Danger所做的更先进的消费类智能手机。尼克认为，Danger未能达到预期成功的原因之一，是设备本身的界面和形态设计。“每个人都把它看作是一款标志性设备，但我们知道它的形态设计还不够小，无法让人们想要随身携带。它仍然是一款厚重的设备，屏幕也是一个独立的部分。”
- en: Android’s vision didn’t appeal to Nick; he wasn’t interested in cameras. Phones
    were where his experience and his interests were. He told Andy, “If you change
    your mind and end up doing phones, give me a call.”

  zh: Android的愿景并没有吸引尼克，他对相机不感兴趣。手机才是他经验和兴趣的所在。他告诉安迪，“如果你改变主意，做手机的话，给我打个电话。”
- en: 'Soon after that conversation, Andy spoke with another colleague from the Danger
    days: Rich Miner. Rich, on behalf of his employer, the mobile carrier Orange,
    was an early investor in Danger. After getting to know Andy through that experience,
    Rich kept in touch to see what else he’d do in the future.'

  zh: 在那次谈话后不久，安迪与另一位来自Danger时期的同事里奇·迈纳进行了交谈。里奇代表他的雇主——移动运营商Orange，成为Danger的早期投资者。通过与安迪的合作，里奇了解了他，并一直保持联系，想看看他将来会做什么。
- en: Rich, like Nick, suggested that Andy’s startup should consider building mobile
    phones instead of cameras. Rich had a long history with the mobile phone market
    and saw an opportunity for Android to make a difference there. Chris was also
    talking to Andy about that possibility. But Andy was still resistant.

  zh: Rich和Nick一样，建议安迪的初创公司应该考虑制造手机，而不是相机。Rich在手机市场有着悠久的历史，他看到了Android在该领域改变局势的机会。Chris也在和Andy讨论这个可能性。但Andy仍然心存抗拒。
- en: Andy didn’t *want* to do phones again. He was ultimately frustrated by his experiences
    at Danger, which hadn’t turned out as well as he had hoped. But at the same time,
    he was pitching the camera idea to venture capitalists (VCs) and not getting any
    interest. Also, he was looking at the realities of the camera market and saw that
    sales at the time were going down, as manufacturers started to put cameras in
    mobile phones.

  zh: 安迪*不想*再做手机了。他最终对在Danger的经历感到失望，因为那并没有按照他预期的方式发展。但与此同时，他向风险投资家（VCs）推销相机的想法，却没有得到任何兴趣。而且，他也看到了相机市场的现实，当时的销量开始下滑，因为制造商们开始将相机集成到手机中。
- en: In November of 2004, Andy was at another meeting with VCs. His pitch for the
    camera OS met with the same lack of interest. So he mentioned phones as a possibility
    and saw ears in the room perk up.

  zh: 2004年11月，安迪又一次与风险投资家开会。他推销相机操作系统时依然没有引起兴趣。所以他提到了手机作为一个可能性，结果房间里的人开始关注起来。

    2005, they joined Android as co-founders.

  zh: 这正是Rich和Nick所需要的。他们开始与Andy一起合作，制定关于手机操作系统的商业计划和推介资料。在2005年初，他们作为共同创始人加入了Android。
- en: Andy didn’t get to build his camera OS. But given how critical the camera is
    on phones today, you could argue that he created the most widely used camera OS
    ever; he just did it in a roundabout way.

  zh: 安迪没有建成自己的相机操作系统。但鉴于今天手机上相机的重要性，你可以说他创造了史上最广泛使用的相机操作系统；他只是通过间接的方式做到了这一点。

    DSLRs. These things were getting more powerful, but the UIs were terrible.

- en: Digital camera technology in 2003 was becoming interesting; digital single-lens
    reflex cameras (DSLRs) combined high-quality lenses with increasingly large sensors
    to capture more and more detail in digital image files. But the software for these
    cameras was . . . not great.

- en: Andy Rubin, who had founded and recently left the mobile phone manufacturer
    Danger, was looking for a new project. Along with Chris White, a former colleague
    at WebTV, he started a new company to make better camera software. With Andy as
    CEO and Chris as CTO, they founded FotoFarm in late 2003 to provide an operating
    system for digital cameras. The software they envisioned would enable better UIs
    and networking, along with the ability to run apps. Combined with superior camera
    hardware, they would push the boundaries of photographic and imaging functionality
    and experience.

    Andy already had the URL android.com, so they changed the name to Android and
    hired the design firm Character to help create their corporate identity, including
    their logo and business cards.

    platform. But nobody else cared about cameras; everyone wanted to talk about phones.

- en: Andy invited Nick Sears to meet with him at Android’s offices in Palo Alto to
    pitch the camera OS. The two had worked closely together on Danger’s phone, the
    T-Mobile Sidekick. Nick had decided to leave T-Mobile, but to continue working
    on mobile phones. He wanted to build a consumer smartphone that went beyond what
    they had been able to build at Danger. Nick felt that one of the reasons Danger
    hadn’t succeeded as much as they’d hoped was the interface and form factor of
    the device itself. “Everybody looked at it as this iconic device, but we knew
    that the form factor wasn’t small enough yet that people wanted to carry it in
    their hands. It was still a thick device and had to have the screen as a separate
    thing.”

    were where his experience and his interests were. He told Andy, “If you change
    your mind and end up doing phones, give me a call.”

    days: Rich Miner. Rich, on behalf of his employer, the mobile carrier Orange,
    was an early investor in Danger. After getting to know Andy through that experience,
    Rich kept in touch to see what else he’d do in the future.'

    phones instead of cameras. Rich had a long history with the mobile phone market
    and saw an opportunity for Android to make a difference there. Chris was also
    talking to Andy about that possibility. But Andy was still resistant.

- en: Andy didn’t *want* to do phones again. He was ultimately frustrated by his experiences
    at Danger, which hadn’t turned out as well as he had hoped. But at the same time,
    he was pitching the camera idea to venture capitalists (VCs) and not getting any
    interest. Also, he was looking at the realities of the camera market and saw that
    sales at the time were going down, as manufacturers started to put cameras in
    mobile phones.

- en: In November of 2004, Andy was at another meeting with VCs. His pitch for the
    camera OS met with the same lack of interest. So he mentioned phones as a possibility
    and saw ears in the room perk up.

    to pull together a business plan and a pitch deck around a phone OS. And in early
    2005, they joined Android as co-founders.

    on phones today, you could argue that he created the most widely used camera OS
    ever; he just did it in a roundabout way.

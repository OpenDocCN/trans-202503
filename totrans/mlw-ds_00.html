<p class="noindent">If you’re working in security, chances are you’re using data science more than ever before, even if you may not realize it. For example, your antivirus product uses data science algorithms to detect malware. Your firewall vendor may have data science algorithms detecting suspicious network activity. Your security information and event management (SIEM) software probably uses data science to identify suspicious trends in your data. Whether conspicuously or not, the entire security industry is moving toward incorporating more data science into security products.</p>
<p class="indent">Advanced IT security professionals are incorporating their own custom machine learning algorithms into their workflows. For example, in recent conference presentations and news articles, security analysts at Target, Mastercard, and Wells Fargo all described developing custom data science <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxii"/>technologies that they use as part of their security workflows.<a id="introfn_1"/><a href="footnote.xhtml#introfn1"><sup>1</sup></a> If you’re not already on the data science bandwagon, there’s no better time to upgrade your skills to include data science into your security practice.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev1"><strong>What Is Data Science?</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Data science</em> is a growing set of algorithmic tools that allow us to understand and make predictions about data using statistics, mathematics, and artful statistical data visualizations. More specific definitions exist, but generally, data science has three subcomponents: machine learning, data mining, and data visualization.</p>
<p class="indent">In the security context, machine learning algorithms learn from training data to detect new threats. These methods have been proven to detect malware that flies under the radar of traditional detection techniques like signatures. Data mining algorithms search security data for interesting patterns (such as relationships between threat actors) that might help us discern attack campaigns targeting our organizations. Finally, data visualization renders sterile, tabular data into graphical format to make it easier for people to spot interesting and suspicious trends. I cover all three areas in depth in this book and show you how to apply them.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev2"><strong>Why Data Science Matters for Security</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Data science is critically important for the future of cybersecurity for three reasons: first, security is <em>all about data</em>. When we seek to detect cyber threats, we’re analyzing data in the form of files, logs, network packets, and other artifacts. Traditionally, security professionals didn’t use data science techniques to make detections based on these data sources. Instead, they used file hashes, custom-written rules like signatures, and manually defined heuristics. Although these techniques have their merits, they required handcrafted techniques for each type of attack, necessitating too much manual work to keep up with the changing cyber threat landscape. In recent years, data science techniques have become crucial in bolstering our ability to detect threats.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, data science is important to cybersecurity because the number of cyberattacks on the internet has grown dramatically. Take the growth of the malware underworld as an example. In 2008, there were about 1 million unique malware executables known to the security community. By 2012, there were 100 million. As this book goes to press in 2018, there are more than 700 million malicious executables known to the security community (<em><a href="https://www.av-test.org/en/statistics/malware/">https://www.av-test.org/en/statistics/malware/</a></em>), and this number is likely to grow.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiii"/>Due to the sheer volume of malware, manual detection techniques such as signatures are no longer a reasonable method for detecting all cyberattacks. Because data science techniques automate much of the work that goes into detecting cyberattacks, and vastly decrease the memory usage needed to detect such attacks, they hold tremendous promise in defending networks and users as cyber threats grow.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, data science matters for security because data science is <em>the</em> technical trend of the decade, both inside and outside of the security industry, and it will likely remain so through the next decade. Indeed, you’ve probably seen applications of data science everywhere—in personal voice assistants (Amazon Echo, Siri, and Google Home), self-driving cars, ad recommendation systems, web search engines, medical image analysis systems, and fitness tracking apps.</p>
<p class="indent">We can expect data science–driven systems to have major impacts in legal services, education, and other areas. Because data science has become a key enabler across the technical landscape, universities, major companies (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM), and governments are investing billions of dollars to improve data science tools. Thanks to these investments, data science tools will become even more adept at solving hard attack-detection problems.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev3"><strong>Applying Data Science to Malware</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">This book focuses on data science as it applies to <em>malware</em>, which we define as executable programs written with malicious intent, because malware continues to be the primary means by which threat actors gain a foothold on networks and subsequently achieve their goals. For example, in the ransomware scourge that has emerged in recent years, attackers typically send users malicious email attachments that download ransomware executables (malware) to users’ machines, which then encrypt users’ data and ask them for a ransom to decrypt the data. Although skilled attackers working for governments sometimes avoid using malware altogether to fly under the radar of detection systems, malware continues to be the major enabling technology in cyberattacks today.</p>
<p class="indent">By homing in on a specific application of security data science rather than attempting to cover security data science broadly, this book aims to show more thoroughly how data science techniques can be applied to a major security problem. By understanding malware data science, you’ll be better equipped to apply data science to other areas of security, like detecting network attacks, phishing emails, or suspicious user behavior. Indeed, almost all the techniques you’ll learn in this book apply to building data science detection and intelligence systems in general, not just for malware.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiv"/><strong>Who Should Read This Book?</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">This book is aimed toward security professionals who are interested in learning more about how to apply data science to computer security problems. If computer security <em>and</em> data science are new to you, you might find yourself having to look up terms to give yourself a little bit of context, but you can still read this book successfully. If you’re only interested in data science, but not security, this book is probably not for you.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev5"><strong>About This Book</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The first part of the book consists of three chapters that cover basic reverse engineering concepts necessary for understanding the malware data science techniques discussed later in the book. If you’re new to malware, read the first three chapters first. If you’re an old hand at malware reverse engineering, you can skip these chapters.</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a>: Basic Static Malware Analysis</strong> covers static analysis techniques for picking apart malware files and discovering how they achieve malicious ends on our computers.</li>
<li class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>: Beyond Basic Static Analysis: x86 Disassembly</strong> gives you a brief overview of x86 assembly language and how to disassemble and reverse engineer malware.</li>
<li class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>: A Brief Introduction to Dynamic Analysis</strong> concludes the reverse engineering section of the book by discussing dynamic analysis, which involves running malware in controlled environments to learn about its behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The next two chapters of the book, <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapters 4</a> and <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">5</a>, focus on malware relationship analysis, which involves looking at similarities and differences between collections of malware to identify malware campaigns against your organization, such as a ransomware campaign controlled by a group of cybercriminals, or a concerted, targeted attack on your organization. These stand-alone chapters are for readers who are interested not only in detecting malware, but also in extracting valuable threat intelligence to learn who is attacking their network. If you’re less interested in threat intelligence and more interested in data science–driven malware detection, you can safely skip these chapters.</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>: Identifying Attack Campaigns Using Malware Networks</strong> shows you how to analyze and visualize malware based on shared attributes, such as the hostnames that malware programs call out to.</li>
<li class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5</a>: Shared Code Analysis</strong> explains how to identify and visualize shared code relationships between malware samples, which can help you identify whether groups of malware samples came from one or multiple criminal groups.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxv"/>The next four chapters cover everything you need to know to understand, apply, and implement machine learning–based malware detection systems. These chapters also provide a foundation for applying machine learning to other security contexts.</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06">Chapter 6</a>: Understanding Machine Learning–Based Malware Detectors</strong> is an accessible, intuitive, and non-mathematical introduction to basic machine learning concepts. If you have a history with machine learning, this chapter will provide a convenient refresher.</li>
<li class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7</a>: Evaluating Malware Detection Systems</strong> shows you how to evaluate the accuracy of your machine learning systems using basic statistical methods so that you can select the best possible approach.</li>
<li class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8</a>: Building Machine Learning Detectors</strong> introduces open source machine learning tools you can use to build your own machine learning systems and explains how to use them.</li>
<li class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9</a>: Visualizing Malware Trends</strong> covers how to visualize malware threat data to reveal attack campaigns and trends using Python, and how to integrate data visualization into your day-to-day workflow when analyzing security data.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The last three chapters introduce deep learning, an advanced area of machine learning that involves a bit more math. Deep learning is a hot growth area within security data science, and these chapters provide enough to get you started.</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a>: Deep Learning Basics</strong> covers the basic concepts that underlie deep learning.</li>
<li class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>: Building a Neural Network Malware Detector with Keras</strong> explains how to implement deep learning–based malware detection systems in Python using open source tools.</li>

<li class="noindent"><strong>Appendix: An Overview of Datasets and Tools</strong> describes the data and example tool implementations accompanying the book.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev6"><strong>How to Use the Sample Code and Data</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">No good programming book is complete without sample code to play with and extend on your own. Sample code and data accompany each chapter of this book and are described exhaustively in the appendix. All the code targets Python 2.7 in Linux environments. To access the code and data, you can download a VirtualBox Linux virtual machine, which has the code, data, and supporting open source tools all set up and ready to go, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxvi"/>and run it within your own VirtualBox environment. You can download the book’s accompanying data at <em><a href="http://www.malwaredatascience.com/">http://www.malwaredatascience.com/</a></em>, and you can download the VirtualBox for free at <em><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a></em>. The code has been tested on Linux, but if you prefer to work outside of the Linux VirtualBox, the same code should work almost as well on MacOS, and to a lesser extent on Windows machines.</p>
<p class="indent">If you’d rather install the code and data in your own Linux environment, you can download them here: <em><a href="http://www.malwaredatascience.com/">http://www.malwaredatascience.com/</a></em>. You’ll find a directory for each chapter in the downloadable archive, and within each chapter’s directory there are <em>code/</em> and <em>data/</em> directories that contain the corresponding code and data. Code files correspond to chapter listings or sections, whichever makes more sense for the application at hand. Some code files are exactly like the listings, whereas others have been changed slightly to make it easier for you to play with parameters and other options. Code directories come with pip <em>requirements.txt</em> files, which give the open source libraries that the code in that chapter depends on to run. To install these libraries on your machine, simply type <span class="codestrong">pip -r requirements.txt</span> in each chapter’s <em>code/</em> directory.</p>
<p class="indent">Now that you have access to the code and data for this book, let’s get started.</p>

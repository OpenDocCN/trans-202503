    improve the truck’s ability to tow heavy loads, the speedometer was thrown off
    because of the change in gear ratio, the transmission was shifting too late, and
    the antilock braking system was inoperable. The engine computer had to be reprogrammed
    to make the speedometer read correctly, and the transmission controller needed
    to be reprogrammed to make the truck shift properly. After proper calibration,
    the truck was able to work correctly.

- en: If performance tuning is powerful and offers so many benefits, why don’t cars
    come from the factory with the best possible settings? The short answer is that
    there is no best setting; there are only trade-offs and compromises, which depend
    on what you want from any particular vehicle. There’s always an interplay between
    settings. For example, the settings for getting the most horsepower out of a vehicle
    are not the same as the settings that deliver the best fuel economy. There’s a
    similar trade-off between lowest emissions, maximum fuel economy, and maximum
    power. In order to simultaneously increase fuel economy and power output, it is
    necessary to increase the average pressure from combustion, which means the engine
    will be operating closer to the edge of safe operating conditions. Tuning is a
    game of compromises in which the engine is configured to achieve a specific goal
    without self-destructing.

- en: That said, it is actually possible to gain more power *and* improve fuel economy—by
    raising the brake mean effective pressure (BMEP). The BMEP is essentially the
    average pressure applied to the pistons during engine operation. The trade-off
    here, however, is that it’s hard to raise BMEP significantly without also increasing
    the peak cylinder pressure during a combustion event, and so increasing the chance
    of detonation. There are firm limits on the maximum peak pressure in a given situation
    due to the motor’s physical construction, the fuel being used, and physical and
    material factors. Increasing peak cylinder pressure beyond a certain limit will
    generally result in combustion without spark due to *autoignition*, also known
    as *detonation*, which will typically destroy engines quickly.

    tuning. Most performance modifications are designed to change an engine’s physical
    operation, which often requires a corresponding change to the calibration of the
    engine computer to achieve optimal operation. Sometimes this recalibration requires
    physically modifying a computer by removing and reprogramming chips, known as
    *chip tuning*. In other cases, it’s possible to reprogram the ECU by communicating
    with it using a special protocol instead of physically modifyng it, which is called

- en: Chip tuning is the oldest form of engine computer modification. Most early engine
    controllers used dedicated ROM memory chips. In order to change a chip’s operation,
    you had to physically remove the chip, reprogram it outside the ECU, and then
    reinstall it—a process called *chipping*. Users who expect to make repeated modifications
    on older vehicles often install sockets in place of the ROM to allow easier insertion
    and removal of chips.

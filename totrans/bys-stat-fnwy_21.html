<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/common.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16">Chapter 16</a>, we used the Bayes factor and posterior odds to find out how many times better one hypothesis was than a competing one. But these tools of Bayesian reasoning can do even more than just compare ideas. In this chapter, we’ll use the Bayes factor and posterior odds to quantify how much evidence it should take to convince someone of a hypothesis. We’ll also see how to estimate the strength of someone else’s prior belief in a certain hypothesis. We’ll do all of this using a famous episode of the classic TV series <em>The Twilight Zone</em>.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch17lev1sec1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_168"/><strong>Bayesian Reasoning in the Twilight Zone</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">One of my favorite episodes of <em>The Twilight Zone</em> is called “The Nick of Time.” In this episode, a young, newly married couple, Don and Pat, wait in a small-town diner while a mechanic repairs their car. In the diner, they come across a fortune-telling machine called the Mystic Seer that accepts yes or no questions and, for a penny, spits out cards with answers to each question.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Don, who is very superstitious, asks the Mystic Seer a series of questions. When the machine answers correctly, he begins to believe in its supernatural powers. However, Pat remains skeptical of the machine’s powers, even as the Seer continues to provide correct answers.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Although Don and Pat are looking at the same data, they come to different conclusions. How can we explain why they reason differently when given the same evidence? We can use the Bayes factor to get deeper insight into how these two characters are thinking about the data.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch17lev1sec2"><strong>Using the Bayes Factor to Understand the Mystic Seer</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In the episode, we are faced with two competing hypotheses. Let’s call them <em>H</em> and <img alt="Image" class="middle" src="../images/h-bar.jpg"/> (or “not <em>H</em>”), since one hypothesis is the negation of the other:</p>&#13;
<p class="hangt"><em><strong>H</strong></em> The Mystic Seer truly can predict the future.</p>&#13;
<p class="hangb"><img alt="Image" class="middle" src="../images/h-bar.jpg"/> The Mystic Seer just got lucky.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Our data, <em>D</em>, in this case is the sequence of <em>n</em> correct answers the Mystic Seer provides. The greater <em>n</em> is, the stronger the evidence in favor of <em>H</em>. The major assumption in the <em>Twilight Zone</em> episode is that the Mystic Seer <em>is</em> correct every time, so the question is: is this result supernatural, or is it merely a coincidence? For us, <em>D</em>, our data, always represents a sequence of <em>n</em> correct answers. Now we can assess our likelihoods, or the probability of getting our data given each hypothesis.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>P</em>(<em>D</em> | <em>H</em>) is the probability of getting <em>n</em> correct answers in a row given that the Mystic Seer can predict the future. This likelihood will always be 1, no matter the number of questions asked. This is because, if the Mystic Seer is supernatural, it will always pick the right answer, whether it is asked one question or a thousand. Of course, this also means that if the Mystic Seer gets a single answer wrong, the probability for this hypothesis will drop to 0, because a psychic machine wouldn’t ever guess incorrectly. In that case, we might want to come up with a weaker hypothesis—for example, that the Mystic Seer is correct 90 percent of the time (we’ll explore a similar problem in <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19">Chapter 19</a>).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>P</em>(<em>D</em> | <img alt="Image" class="middle" src="../images/h-bar.jpg"/>) is the probability of getting <em>n</em> correct answers in a row if the Mystic Seer is randomly spitting out answers. Here, <em>P</em>(<em>D</em> | <img alt="Image" class="middle" src="../images/h-bar.jpg"/>) is 0.5<em><sup>n</sup></em>. In other words, if the machine is just guessing, then each answer has a 0.5 chance of being correct.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_169"/>To compare these hypotheses, let’s look at the ratio of the two likelihoods:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0169-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">As a reminder, this ratio measures how many times more likely the data is, given <em>H</em> as opposed to <img alt="Image" class="middle" src="../images/h-bar.jpg"/>, when we assume both hypotheses are equally likely. Now let’s see how these ideas compare.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch17lev2sec1"><strong><em>Measuring the Bayes Factor</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">As we did in the preceding chapter, we’ll temporarily ignore the ratio of our prior odds and concentrate on comparing the ratio of the likelihoods, or the Bayes factor. We’re assuming (for the time being) that the Mystic Seer has an equal chance of being supernatural as it does of being simply lucky.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this example, our numerator, <em>P</em>(<em>D</em> | <em>H</em>), is always 1, so for any value of <em>n</em> we have:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0169-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s imagine the Mystic Seer has given three correct answers so far. At this point, <em>P</em>(<em>D</em><sub>3</sub> | <em>H</em>) = 1, and <em>P</em>(<em>D</em> | <em>H</em>) = 0.5<sup>3</sup> = 0.125. Clearly <em>H</em> explains the data better, but certainly nobody—not even superstitious Don—will be convinced by only three correct guesses. Assuming the prior odds are the same, our Bayes factor for three questions is:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0169-03.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">We can use the same guidelines we used for evaluating posterior odds in <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16tab01">Table 16-1</a> to evaluate Bayes factors here (if we assume each hypothesis is equally likely), as shown in <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17tab01">Table 17-1</a>. As you can see, a Bayes factor (BF) of 8 is far from conclusive.</p>&#13;

</table>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_170"/>So, at three questions answered correctly and with BF = 8, we should at least be curious about the power of the Mystic Seer, though we shouldn’t be convinced yet.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But by this point in the episode, Don already seems pretty sure that the Mystic Seer is psychic. It takes only four correct answers for him to feel certain of it. On the other hand, it takes 14 questions for Pat to even <em>start considering</em> the possibility seriously, resulting in a Bayes factor of 16,384—way more evidence than she should need.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Calculating the Bayes factor doesn’t explain why Don and Pat form different beliefs about the evidence, though. What’s going on there?</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch17lev2sec2"><strong><em>Accounting for Prior Beliefs</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The element missing in our model is each character’s prior belief in the hypotheses. Remember that Don is extremely superstitious, while Pat is a skeptic. Clearly, Don and Pat are using extra information in their mental models, because each of them arrives at a conclusion of a different strength, and at very different times. This is fairly common in everyday reasoning: two people often respond differently to the exact same facts.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We can model this phenomenon by simply imagining the initial odds of <em>P</em>(<em>H</em>) and <em>P</em>(<img alt="Image" class="middle" src="../images/h-bar.jpg"/>) given no additional information. We call this the <em>prior odds ratio</em>, as you saw in <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16">Chapter 16</a>:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0170-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The concept of prior beliefs in relation to the Bayes factor is actually pretty intuitive. Say we walk into the diner from <em>The Twilight Zone</em>, and I ask you, “What are the odds that the Mystic Seer is psychic?” You might reply, “Uh, one in a million! There’s no way that thing is supernatural.” Mathematically, we can express this as:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0170-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now let’s combine this prior belief with our data. To do this, we’ll multiply our prior odds with the results of the likelihood ratio to get our posterior odds for the hypothesis, given the data we’ve observed:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0170-03.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Thinking there’s only a one in a million chance the Mystic Seer is psychic before looking at any evidence is pretty strong skepticism. The Bayesian approach reflects this skepticism quite well. If you think the hypothesis that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_171"/>the Mystic Seer is supernatural is extremely unlikely from the start, then you’ll require significantly more data to be convinced otherwise. Suppose the Mystic Seer gets five answers correct. Our Bayes factor then becomes:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0171-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">A Bayes factor of 32 is a reasonably strong belief that the Mystic Seer is truly supernatural. However, if we add in our very skeptical prior odds to calculate our posterior odds, we get the following results:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0171-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now our posterior odds tell us it’s extremely unlikely that the machine is psychic. This result corresponds quite well with our intuition. Again, if you really don’t believe in a hypothesis from the start, it’s going to take a lot of evidence to convince you otherwise.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In fact, if we work backward, posterior odds can help us figure out how much evidence we’d need to make you believe <em>H</em>. At a posterior odds of 2, you’d just be starting to consider the supernatural hypothesis. So, if we solve for a posterior odds of greater than 2, we can determine what it would take to convince you.</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0171-03.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">If we solve for <em>n</em> to the nearest whole number, we get:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>n</em> &gt; 21</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">At 21 correct answers in a row, even a strong skeptic should start to think that the Seer may, in fact, be psychic.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Thus, our prior odds can do much more than tell us how strongly we believe something given our background. It can also help us quantify exactly how much evidence we would need to be convinced of a hypothesis. The reverse is true, too; if, after 21 correct answers in a row, you find yourself believing strongly in <em>H</em>, you might want to weaken your prior odds.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch17lev1sec3"><strong>Developing Our Own Psychic Powers</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">At this point, we’ve learned how to compare hypotheses and calculate how much favorable evidence it would take to convince us of <em>H</em>, given our prior belief in <em>H</em>. Now we’ll look at one more trick we can do with posterior odds: quantifying Don and Pat’s prior beliefs based on their reactions to the evidence.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_172"/>We don’t know exactly how strongly Don and Pat believe in the possibility that the Mystic Seer is psychic when they first walk into the diner. But we <em>do</em> know it takes Don about seven correct questions to become essentially certain of the Mystic Seer’s supernatural abilities. We can estimate that at this point Don’s posterior odds are 150—the threshold for <em>very strong</em> beliefs, according to <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17tab01">Table 17-1</a>. Now we can write out everything we know, except for <em>O</em>(<em>H</em>), which we’ll be solving for:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0172-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Solving this for <em>O</em>(<em>H</em>) gives us:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>O</em>(<em>H</em>)<sub>Don</sub> = 1.17</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">What we have now is a quantitative model for Don’s superstitious beliefs. Because his initial odds ratio is greater than 1, Don walks into the diner being slightly more willing than not to believe that the Mystic Seer is supernatural, before collecting any data at all. This makes sense, of course, given his superstitious nature.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now on to Pat. At around 14 correct answers, Pat grows nervous, calling the Mystic Seer “a stupid piece of junk!” Although she has begun to suspect that the Mystic Seer might be psychic, she’s not nearly as certain as Don. I would estimate that her posterior odds are 5—the point at which she might start thinking, “Maybe the Mystic Seer <em>could have</em> psychic powers . . .” Now we can create the posterior odds for Pat’s beliefs in the same way:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0172-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">When we solve for <em>O</em>(<em>H</em>), we can model Pat’s skepticism as:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>O</em>(<em>H</em>)<sub>Pat</sub> = 0.0003</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In other words, Pat, walking into the diner, would claim that the Seer has about a 1 in 3,000 chance of being supernatural. Again, this corresponds to our intuition; Pat begins with the very strong belief that the fortune-telling machine is nothing more than a fun game to play while she and Don wait for food.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">What we’ve done here is remarkable. We’ve used our rules of probability to come up with a quantitative statement about what someone believes. In essence, we have become mind readers!</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch17lev1sec4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_173"/><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, we explored three ways of using Bayes factors and posterior odds in order to reason about problems probabilistically. We started by revisiting what we learned in the previous chapter: that we can use posterior odds as a way to compare two ideas. Then we saw that if we know our prior belief in the odds of one hypothesis versus another, we can calculate exactly how much evidence it will take to convince us that we should change our beliefs. Finally, we used posterior odds to assign a value for each person’s prior beliefs by looking at how much evidence it takes to convince them. In the end, posterior odds is far more than just a way to test ideas. It provides us with a framework for thinking about reasoning under uncertainty.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can now use your own “mystic” powers of Bayesian reasoning to answer the exercises below:</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch17lev1sec5"><strong>Exercises</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Try answering the following questions to see how well you understand quantifying the amount of evidence it should take to convince someone of a hypothesis and estimating the strength of someone else’s prior belief. The solutions can be found at <em><a href="https://nostarch.com/learnbayes/">https://nostarch.com/learnbayes/</a></em>.</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Every time you and your friend get together to watch movies, you flip a coin to determine who gets to choose the movie. Your friend always picks heads, and every Friday for 10 weeks, the coin lands on heads. You develop a hypothesis that the coin has two heads sides, rather than both a heads side and a tails side. Set up a Bayes factor for the hypothesis that the coin is a trick coin over the hypothesis that the coin is fair. What does this ratio alone suggest about whether or not your friend is cheating you?</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Now imagine three cases: that your friend is a bit of a prankster, that your friend is honest most of the time but can occasionally be sneaky, and that your friend is very trustworthy. In each case, estimate some prior odds ratios for your hypothesis and compute the posterior odds.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Suppose you trust this friend deeply. Make the prior odds of them cheating 1/10,000. How many times would the coin have to land on heads before you feel unsure about their innocence—say, a posterior odds of 1?</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Another friend of yours also hangs out with this same friend and, after only four weeks of the coin landing on heads, feels certain you’re both being cheated. This confidence implies a posterior odds of about 100. What value would you assign to this other friend’s prior belief that the first friend is a cheater?<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_174"/></li>&#13;

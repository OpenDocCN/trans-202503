<p class="ChapterIntro">Congratulations! You’ve learned a great deal about MySQL development and you’ve applied that new knowledge to real-world projects.</p>
<p>One concept I hope has come through in this book is that there are many ways to skin a MySQL cat. There’s plenty of room for creativity in designing and developing databases. You can use your knowledge of MySQL to build highly customized systems for your particular needs and interests, from your favorite baseball statistics to your startup’s customer list to a massive web-facing database of corporate takeovers.</p>
<p>To dig deeper into MySQL development, you can load public datasets of interest into your own MySQL database. Websites like <a href="https://data.gov" class="LinkURL">https://data.gov</a> and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com" class="LinkURL">https://www.kaggle.com</a> contain data that’s free to use. (Remember to check the terms of the particular datasets you’d like to work with, however.) See if you can load datasets from different sources into MySQL tables and join them in a way that produces new or interesting insights.</p>
<p>I congratulate you on how far you’ve come. Learning to think in rows and columns is no small feat. I hope you’ll continue to take the time to learn new skills all throughout your life. Knowledge is definitely power.</p>

- en: We hope you’ve enjoyed building the projects in this book. It was a lot of fun
    for us to come up with different project ideas that incorporated cardboard, paper,
    ping-pong balls, and other common materials, as well as the basic electronics.
    But the projects in this book are just a start. We hope they inspire you and help
    unleash your inner inventor! We encourage you to combine and mash up components
    and concepts from each of these chapters to create your own *Franken-duino* project!
    If you have comments or ideas that you’d like to share with us, please send us
    a note at *[ArduinoInventorsGuide@sparkfun.com](mailto:ArduinoInventorsGuide@sparkfun.com)*.

    everyone at SparkFun, and our amazing editors at No Starch Press. The ideas and
    projects that we’ve assembled in this book are attributed to all of these people
    and the many whiteboard brainstorming sessions, emails, and side conversations
    that we’ve had over the past few years. We also want to thank our families—Zondra,
    Bear, Bridge, Mariela, Mia, and Maeva—for the support that they have provided
    during the testing, prototyping, and writing process. Thank you!

    interacts with the world around you. With the Processing programming language
    and a little imagination, you’ll scale detailed pixel art to epic proportions,
    record and sample audio to create your own soundboard, and create visualizations
    that reflect changes in sound, light, temperature, and time.'

    interact with the world using motors, LEDs, sensors, and more as you build these

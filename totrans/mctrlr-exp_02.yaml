- en: 'Reported privately in Goodspeed (2012) to ST Microelectronics, this chapter
    is the first public description of a remote code execution exploit for the STM32F217,
    STM32F407, and other chips in the family with mask ROM implementations of the
    USB device firmware update (DFU) protocol. This bug is nice because it’s so straightforward:
    the DFU implementation restricts access to reading and writing memory of a locked
    chip, but changing the target address and executing the application are both freely
    allowed.'

- en: To dump a locked chip’s memory, we’ll first use JTAG to place some shellcode
    into unused SRAM, then reset the chip and use DFU over USB to execute that shellcode,
    dumping all of memory out of the GPIO pins. The bootloader’s dialect of the DFU
    protocol is documented in STMicro (2010); be sure to keep that handy as you read
    this.

    levels: 0, 1, and 2\. Level 0 is unprotected, and if a device is in this level,
    you can simply read out the firmware and close this book. Level 2 allows no debugging
    of any kind, and devices in that level are often attacked by first downgrading
    protection to Level 1.'

- en: Level 1 is a middle ground, and the one you’ll most often find in production
    devices. In this mode, attaching a JTAG debugger will disable access to flash
    memory but preserve access to the CPU, to RAM, and to ROM. There is also the ability
    to downgrade from Level 1 to Level 0, at the cost of mass erasing flash memory
    and destroying whatever might be held there. Developers like this mode because
    failure analysis remains possible, but they are still told that their firmware
    will remain safe against extraction.^([1](footnotes.xhtml#ch2fn1))

- en: The STM32F217 also has three bootloaders in ROM, one each for accepting firmware
    updates by UART, USB DFU, and CAN bus. These three bootloaders share very little
    code with one another, and they implement the Level 1 protections in *software*,
    rather than relying on the hardware protections that exist when connecting a JTAG
    debugger. This is good for us, because it means that if we can trick any one of
    these three bootloaders into reading flash memory, we’ll be able to choose that
    bootloader and dump the chip’s firmware.

    `Detach`, `Download`, `Upload`, `Get Status`, `Clear Status`, `Get State`, and
    `Abort`. Addressing is handled by a block index, rather than an address, and this
    block index is relative to an address pointer.'

- en: Block indexes begin at 2 for data transactions, rather than 0 or 1 as we might
    expect. If you upload 32 bytes to index 2, they will be written to the address
    pointer. Uploading 32 bytes to index 3 will write them 32 bytes after the address
    pointer, and uploading 64 bytes to the same index will write them 64 bytes after
    the address pointer.

- en: An index of 1 is never used. Index 0 indicates a special block, where the first
    byte is one of a few secret commands. Downloading `[0x41]` will mass erase all
    flash memory. An empty string, `[]`, will detach the DFU session and execute the
    application at the target address. Downloading `[0x21, 0x1c, 0x32, 0x00, 0x08]`
    will set the target address pointer to `0x0800321c`. Downloading `[0x92]` will
    first mass erase all of memory, then also unlock the chip to RDP Level 0.^([3](footnotes.xhtml#ch2fn3))

    to the special zero block.

    particular interest is that you may still set the address pointer, and you may
    exit the DFU ROM.'

- en: After all that background information, the bug itself isn’t complicated. First,
    JTAG allows us to write an application into unused SRAM, where it will persist
    after a reset of the chip re-connects flash memory and begins to execute the DFU
    bootloader from ROM. Second, the DFU bootloader allows us to set the address pointer
    despite the lock, and when we exit the bootloader, execution continues to the
    application at the target of the pointer!
  id: totrans-25

- en: In practical terms, this means that if the address pointer is set to `0x20003000`,
    the bootloader will jump at exit to the value stored in `0x20003004`. This address
    was chosen because it happens to be in SRAM and unused by the DFU bootloader,
    so that it won’t be overwritten by the bootloader’s stack or global variables.

    memory in a loop using the SPI protocol, with pin PG6 as MOSI and pin PG8 as CLK.
    This is nice and easy to capture with a logic analyzer, as shown in [Figure 2.6](ch02.xhtml#ch2fig6).
    If these pins also have LEDs, they will blink to indicate a successful exploit.

    of your target’s ROM might be a good idea to verify that the bug is present. A

    executing the part of them that is not clobbered by shorter commands.

<p class="noindent">Frank swore aloud when he saw the police horse tied outside Crannock’s house. Since the captain had gone so far as to hire Frank in person, he hadn’t expected to run into any officers. If the captain didn’t trust his officers, either they were under suspicion—so he’d shuffle them to some case far across the city—or they simply weren’t good enough. But, from the looks of it, someone was on the case and Frank was already behind.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">He slid through the open front door and joined the officer and Mr. Crannock in the foyer. Mr. Crannock shot him a disgusted look but didn’t seem surprised to see him. The officer, however, seemed caught off guard.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Who are you?” she demanded, turning on him with parchment and quill in hand.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank ignored her. “Mr. Crannock,” he said. “So wonderful to see you again.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Come to harass us, too?” Crannock asked. “You’re not welcome here, Frank.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I’m not looking for a welcome,” replied Frank. “I’m looking for your wife. I have a few simple questions for her.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_18"/>The officer stared at him. “Frank?” she asked. “Frank Runtime? Former detective turned private eye? What are you doing here? Someone lose a pet dragon?” she scoffed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank ignored her again. “Your wife, Mr. Crannock. Where can I find her?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The old man threw up his hands. “She didn’t do anything! She’s gone straight, you know. For real this time.” His acting wasn’t half-bad for an amateur.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank smiled; he knew its effect was unnerving. Sure enough, Crannock cringed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I know that, Mr. Crannock. I’m here to tap her professional knowledge. Or I could just leave the conversation to . . .”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Officer Notation,” the young officer snapped. “And this is <em>my</em> investigation.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">That was a lie. Officers always worked these investigations in pairs. More importantly, Frank recognized Notation’s name from the duty roster the captain had given him. She had been at the station on the night of the crime.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Officer Notation,” Frank said. “Who said I’m here on an investigation? Maybe I’m simply searching for a lost dragon.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">She scowled.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There was a commotion coming from the back of the house. Someone called for Crannock, but was cut off by a loud braying noise. “My wife is with the horses,” Mr. Crannock said impatiently. “Barn #2. Now go on, get out of my house!” Crannock waved them toward the front door and scurried away through the back.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Thank you,” Frank called as he turned to leave. “Always a pleasure, Mr. Crannock.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Officer Notation followed Frank across the yard. She walked hard, stomping her anger into the ground. “Do you know where you’re going?” she asked.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Barn #2,” answered Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I know that,” seethed Notation. “But where is barn #2?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_19"/>Frank stopped and turned to her. “Just out of the academy, Notation?” he asked.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Only a rookie would ask a search question like that. Didn’t you take Police Procedures and Data Structures? Or have they replaced that course with something less rigorous—Introduction to Turtle Graphics, perhaps?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation seemed taken aback. “Of course I took Police Procedures and Data Structures,” she said, though she sounded uncertain. “But what I meant was—”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank cut her off, “Then you know about arrays and indexes.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Yes, but—” started Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Finding a barn on a farm is a simple enough search task,” Frank interrupted again. “We could use an exhaustive search to check each building. <em>FOR EACH building on the farm: check if it is barn #2</em>. Back in my day, you learned that search on the first day of Police Algorithms.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“But we can do better here. The Crannocks have six barns in a nice line—just like a giant array. Mr. Crannock was kind enough to supply us with the barn number, the index into that array. All we have to do is walk to the corresponding barn.”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0019-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">“That’s not what I meant!” shouted Notation, waving her arms. “I know how to use the index of an array. I know that we only have to walk up to the barn with a giant #2 outside. I graduated first in my class in both Data Structures <em>and</em> Police Algorithms, so don’t lecture me on the correct use of arrays.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Well, you asked,” Frank replied.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What I was asking is: Do you know where this wonderful array of barns is located?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_20"/>“Of course you were,” said Frank. He began walking again. “You still sound like a rookie, though, quoting class rank.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Where are the barns?” shouted the officer, stamping to catch up.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank shot her a smile over his shoulder. “Over this hill.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As Frank had learned years ago, the Crannock family embraced the concept of arrays with an almost fanatical devotion. They organized everything into linear structures with clearly labeled indexes for each element. As he passed barn #0, Frank noted 15 pig troughs, each capable of storing one serving of food. A farm hand was iterating down the line and ladling out the next meal into each array location.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank and Officer Notation moved on to barn #2, labeled with a sign outside its door. Mrs. Crannock’s icy greeting was almost pleasant, compared to previous encounters; she hadn’t even thrown anything . . . yet.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What do you want?” Mrs. Crannock demanded.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Mrs. Crannock,” Notation cut in before Frank could steal her witness. “I was hoping I could ask you a few questions.”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0020-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_21"/>Frank let Officer Notation ask the questions. Billy’s clue hadn’t yielded anything more than a lead to the farm, but Notation appeared to be working from a better collection of clues.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Mrs. Crannock sneered and spat on the ground. “I didn’t do anything,” she said. “I’ve gone straight, you know.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I’m not here to arrest you,” said Notation. “I need to ask you about a certain donkey cart—the ArrayCart?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A flicker of doubt went through Frank. Could Officer Notation be here for a different case? He doubted it. His gut told him that she was after the lost documents, and he had learned to trust his gut.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“The ArrayCart,” said Mrs. Crannock suspiciously, though with the barest note of pride. “My own invention. Based it off of an array. It’s got individual storage pens for our animals. Each pen stores exactly one animal. Since they all have separate doors, you can walk up to any pen and take an animal out or put one in. Easy access to any storage location. Saves hours of wrangling.”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0021-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">“It’s quite ingenious,” Officer Notation conceded. “You’ve found a way to apply the concept of arrays and indexes to livestock transportation.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“And that’s just the beginning,” added Mrs. Crannock. “I’m working with a certain <em>wizard</em> on a completely new type of ArrayCart—one with magical pointers! I bet they’d be perfect for the police force. Tell your captain that I can give him a good price.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_22"/>Frank had to hand it to Notation. The surest way to get a Crannock talking was to bring up arrays.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“You have a few ArrayCarts that you rent out now. Is that correct?” probed Officer Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Mrs. Crannock’s eyes became instantly cold. “It’s a legitimate business. We pay our taxes.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank held back a derisive snort.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Did you happen to rent an ArrayCart to anyone two nights ago?” pressed Officer Notation. “A smaller model with six pens.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I might’ve,” said Mrs. Crannock. Her cold demeanor was creeping toward hostile.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Do you have a record of who rented it?” asked the officer.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“No,” said Mrs. Crannock. “We shred the records once the carts are returned. I don’t happen to recall who rented that one.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It seemed like Billy’s hint had paid off. If you were a criminal in need of transportation, there were few places that would rent you a cart, and fewer still that would forget your name afterward. Mrs. Crannock may have claimed to have gone straight, but apparently she still, at the very least, provided a valuable service to her former associates.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Are you sure you don’t remember anything about your customer?” prompted Officer Notation, but Frank knew it was pointless. He had once questioned her for three hours about a stolen yak. She hadn’t given him a single peep, despite being the one who had been robbed. Mrs. Crannock wouldn’t talk.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">While Officer Notation tried a few variations of the same question, Frank quietly slipped out of the barn and found the cart lot. As he expected, the lot was organized as an array with 10 labeled parking spots. Only spots #2, #4, and #8 were occupied. The carts in positions #2 and #4 had 10 pens apiece, so were too large to fit Notation’s description. But slot #8 held a six-pen ArrayCart, its wheels still coated with fresh mud.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_23"/><img src="../images/f0023-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">After a quick glance around, Frank heaved himself into the back of the six-pen ArrayCart. A scattering of straw covered the floor, but the cart was otherwise empty. Frank opened each pen in turn, scanning the empty storage spaces for any clues. Then, getting down on his hands and knees, he sifted through the straw until he found a few scraps of parchment.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">He collected six tiny pieces in all, probably corners that had caught on nails as the scrolls were unloaded. Only two of the pieces contained writing, and those appeared to be from ledgers. It wasn’t exactly a solid lead, but it tied the cart to the crime.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank moved his search to the front of the cart, carefully inspecting everything around the driver’s seat. The seat itself gave him his first real clue. There he found a few black and orange threads caught by the seat’s splintered wood. From the vividness of the colors alone, Frank could tell the cloak must have been new. Satisfied, he pocketed the threads and stepped down from the cart.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Only when a gust of fresh air hit him did he notice he’d been holding his breath. Around the cart was a stench of rotting fish. He sniffed lightly, following the smell, and arrived at the mud-caked wheels. He took a great, deep sniff and immediately regretted it. The smell of rotting eel emanating from the mud was as unmistakable as it was unpleasant.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank half-smiled, half-gagged as he staggered back from the cart. He might not know who had rented it, but now he knew where it had been.</p>&#13;

<p class="sbsub"><em><strong>Excerpt from Professor Drecker’s Lecture</strong></em></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Arrays are simple data structures that allow you to store multiple values. An array is like a row of bins. Each bin can store a single piece of information, such as a number or a character.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0024-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The structure of an array means you can access any value (or element) within the array, whether to write to it or read from it, by specifying its location, or <em>index</em>, within the array. Many programming languages use 0-indexed arrays, which means the first value of the array resides at index 0, the second at index 1, and so forth. Commonly, you reference the value at index <em>i</em> of array <em>A</em> as <em>A</em>[<em>i</em>]; for example, the third element of array <em>A</em> would be <em>A</em>[2] and equal to 19.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You likely recognize this structure from your introductory tour of the holding cells in the capital’s police station yesterday. The king personally suggested the use of indexed, single-person cells to streamline the retrieval of prisoners. Each station is equipped with an array of four to eight holding cells, depending on the size of the local criminal population.</p>&#13;

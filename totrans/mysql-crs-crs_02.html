<p class="ChapterIntro">To begin working with databases, you’ll install the free version of MySQL, called <em>MySQL Community Server </em>(also known as <em>MySQL Community Edition</em>), and two handy tools: MySQL Workbench and the MySQL command line client. This software can be downloaded for free from the MySQL website. You will use these tools to work on projects and exercises later in this book.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">MySQL uses a <em>client/server architecture</em>, as shown in <a href="#figure1-1" id="figureanchor1-1">Figure 1-1</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>The server side of this architecture hosts and manages resources or services that the client side needs to access. This means that, in a live production environment, the server software (MySQL Community Server) would run on a dedicated computer housing the MySQL database. The tools used to access the database, MySQL Workbench and the MySQL command line client, would reside on the user’s computer.</p>
<p>Because you’re setting up a development environment for learning purposes, you’ll install both the MySQL client tools and the MySQL Community Server software on the same computer. In other words, your computer will act as both the client and the server.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Instructions for installing MySQL are available at <a href="https://dev.mysql.com" class="LinkURL">https://dev.mysql.com</a>. Click <b>MySQL Documentation</b>, and under the MySQL Server heading, click <b>MySQL Reference Manual</b> and select the most recent version. You’ll then be taken to the reference manual for that version. On the left-hand menu, click <b>Installing and Upgrading MySQL</b>. Find your operating system in the table of contents and follow the instructions to download and install MySQL Community Server.</p>
<p>There are countless ways to install MySQL—for example, from a ZIP archive, the source code, or a MySQL installer program. The instructions vary based on your operating system and which MySQL products you want <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="5" id="Page_5"/>to use, so the best and most current resource for installation is always the MySQL website. However, I’ll offer a few tips:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>When you install MySQL, it creates a database user called <code>root</code> and asks you to choose a password. <em>Don’t lose this password</em>; you’ll need it later.</li>
<li>In general, I’ve found it easier to use an installer program, like MySQL Installer, if one is available.</li>
<li>If you’re using Windows, you’ll be given the option of two different installers: a web installer or a full bundle installer. However, it’s not obvious which one is which, as shown in <a href="#figure1-2" id="figureanchor1-2">Figure 1-2</a>.

<figcaption><p><a id="figure1-2">Figure 1-2</a>: Selecting the web installer for Windows</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="ListBody">The web installer has a much smaller file size and its filename contains the word <em>web</em>, as highlighted in the figure. I recommend choosing this option because it allows you to select the MySQL products you want to install, and it downloads them from the web. The full bundle installer contains all MySQL products, which shouldn’t be necessary.</p>
<p class="ListBody">As of this writing, both installers appear on this web page as 32-bit. This refers to the installation application, not MySQL itself. Either installer can install 64-bit binaries. In fact, on Windows, MySQL is available only for 64-bit operating systems.</p></li>
<li>You can download MySQL without creating an account if you prefer. On the web page shown in <a href="#figure1-3" id="figureanchor1-3">Figure 1-3</a>, select <b>No Thanks, Just Start My Download</b> at the bottom of the screen.</li>
</ul>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure1-3">Figure 1-3</a>: Downloading MySQL without creating an account</p></figcaption>

<p>From here, your next step is to download MySQL Workbench, a graphical tool used to access MySQL databases. With this tool, you can explore your database, run SQL statements against that database, and review the data that gets returned. To download MySQL Workbench, go to <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/" class="LinkURL">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/</a>. This takes you directly to the MySQL Workbench reference manual. Click <b>Installation</b> in the left-hand menu, choose your operating system, and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>When you install MySQL Community Server or MySQL Workbench on your computer, the MySQL command line client should be installed automatically. This client allows you to connect to a MySQL database from the <em>command line interface</em> of your computer (also called the<em> console</em>, <em>command prompt</em>, or <em>terminal</em>). You can use this tool to run a SQL statement, or many SQL statements saved in a script file, against a MySQL database. The MySQL command line client is useful in situations where you don’t need to see your results in a nicely formatted graphical user interface.</p>
<p>You’ll use these three MySQL products for most of what you do in MySQL, including the exercises in this book.</p>
<p>Now that your computer is set up with MySQL, you can start creating databases!</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, you installed MySQL, MySQL Workbench, and the MySQL command line client from the official website. You located the MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench reference manuals, which contain tons of useful information. I recommend using these if you get stuck, have questions, or want to learn more.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to view and create MySQL databases and tables.</p>

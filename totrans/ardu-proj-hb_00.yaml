- en: The Arduino is a small, inexpensive computer that can be programmed to control
    endless creations limited only by your imagination. As you’ll soon see, the Arduino
    can be used to make a whole host of projects, like a ghost detector, joystick-controlled
    laser, electronic die, laser trip wire alarm, motion sensor alarm, keypad entry
    system, and many others. All of these projects are easy to build and have one
    thing in common—they use the power of the Arduino.

    *Gadgets and Gizmos*, hidden away in a local bookstore. The projects were simple
    ones like making a working lighthouse using flashlight bulbs and building a revolving
    display table using an old clock. The ideas in that book sparked my imagination,
    and I’ve been creating ever since.

    and find out how they worked. I usually struggled to put them back together but
    amassed a good selection of components to tinker with. (This is a great way of
    gathering lots of parts, by the way.)

    for my Subbuteo table-top soccer game and creating a loudspeaker system to blast
    out music at the halftime break in a game. I even managed to extract some LEDs
    from a Star Wars toy, only to burn them out because I didn’t understand what a
    resistor was at the time. I used small motors, buzzers, and solar cells to create
    burglar alarms and super whizzy cars, and I burned out a few motors too!

    the ZX Spectrum 48k microcomputer, introducing home computing to the UK mass market.
    (The United States had its Commodore 64.) While intended as a serious computer,
    the ZX Spectrum inadvertently lent itself more to gaming due to its inclusion
    of the simple programming language BASIC. As a result, software houses sprouted
    in bedrooms across the country as people rushed to build games for the ZX.

    my two passions. Physical computing, where software and hardware react to the
    physical world, was around in the ’80s but confined to the realm of very high-end
    computing and robotics, way out of reach of most households. Now, some 30 years
    later, with the introduction of the Arduino, I find myself tinkering again with
    electronics, but this time I can use programming to bring the projects to life.

- en: In simple terms, the Arduino is a small computer that can be programmed to connect
    and control various electronic parts. The Arduino has a number of pins that can
    be set as either *input*, which means they can receive data from items such as
    switches, buttons, and sensors, or *output*, which means they send data to control
    items such as motors, lights, and buzzers. This type of programmable development
    board is better known as a *microcontroller*.

- en: The Arduino project began in Ivrea, Italy, in 2005 with the goal of creating
    a device to control student-built interactive design projects that would be less
    expensive than other prototyping systems available at the time. Founders Massimo
    Banzi and David Cuartielles named the project after a local bar called Arduino
    (an Italian masculine first name meaning “strong friend”).

    which is the brain of the board, and the software that you’ll use to send your
    program to the brain. The software, called the Arduino *integrated development
    environment (IDE)*, is available free for download.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The IDE is a simple interface that runs on a computer running Windows, OS X,
    or Linux. You use the IDE to create a *sketch* (an Arduino program) that you then
    upload to the Arduino board using a PC and USB cable. The sketch tells the hardware
    what to do. I’ll go into both the hardware and software in more detail in the
    next couple of chapters.

    the Arduino is programmed, it can be disconnected from your computer and will
    run independently using a power supply or batteries.

- en: What was it that encouraged me to write this book? The Internet is bursting
    with tutorials, videos, and articles covering the Arduino and potential projects,
    but many lack detailed visuals or the code required to build these projects. Like
    the *Gizmos and Gadgets* book that inspired me many years ago, this book is intended
    to help you build simple projects that will inspire you to create your own contraptions
    using the skills and techniques that you’ll learn.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book you’ll concentrate on creating your project on a breadboard. This
    is the best way to learn about how circuits work, because the connections are
    not permanent; if you make a mistake, you can just unplug the wire or component
    and try again. Each project has step-by-step instructions for connecting the main
    components, along with photographs to help you with layout. Tables are used in
    most projects for quick reference.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The projects will have a circuit diagram to show the connections clearly, like
    that in [Figure 1](intro.xhtml#intfig01). These have been created with the Fritzing
    program (*[http://www.fritzing.org/](http://www.fritzing.org/)*), a free, open
    source program for creating visual schematics of your projects.

- en: Each project also has the code required to program your Arduino, so you don’t
    need to worry about learning to program before you begin. The early projects provide
    simple explanations of what’s happening in the code, to help you understand the
    process of programming enough to make your own modifications if you want to. If
    you don’t want to type all the code, you can download the programs from *[http://www.nostarch.com/arduinohandbook/](http://www.nostarch.com/arduinohandbook/)*.

- en: The projects in this book begin with the basics and progress steadily to more
    complex designs. That said, this book won’t go deeply into electronics theory
    or programming, but I will give you a good starting point. I’ve written this book
    to teach you how to create your own gadgets. By giving you the technical know-how,
    I allow you to focus on the creative design element. The idea is that learning
    the function of circuits can open up your imagination to ways of using those circuits
    practically.
  prefs: []

- en: This book gives practical information so you can, for example, reference the
    pin connections and replicate them when needed in a different project. You can
    also combine projects to make more complicated and interesting gadgets.

- en: A lot of Arduino books focus on the programming element, and that’s great for
    a certain kind of learning, but I think there is a place for plug-and-play electronics.
    By following the steps in the projects, you will learn as you go.

    simple LEDs with buttons and variable resistors, and then combine components to

    your servo with buttons on the remote.'

    like and feel confident enough to take it on, you can skip to it. I recommend
    you try out some of the earlier projects first, though, as you’ll find information
    there that’s useful for more complicated builds.

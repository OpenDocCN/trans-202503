<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">T</span>he Android team consisted, from the beginning, of people with the right skills and drive to build what was needed. Creating an entire platform, along with the applications, services, and infrastructure that Android needed, was a huge effort, and demanded strenuous effort by people who could dive in quickly to make things work. </p>
<p>It wasn’t a large team . . . but it was the right team.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c48-0001">The Right Experience</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Most of the team came in with exactly the right experience, which allowed them to hit the ground running. Having worked on related platform and mobile projects at companies like Be, Danger, PalmSource, WebTV, and Microsoft, gave them the technical grounding in exactly the right domains to know how to approach similar problems that Android presented.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c48-0002">The Right Attitude</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The Android team grew as it approached 1.0, but only to a size of about 100 people by the time of that first release. This meant that everyone had more than enough work to do to ship the product. But people did what they needed to do to move the work forward, including individuals owning large areas of functionality as well as working across multiple areas, wherever help was needed. Coupled with the startup environment that pushed everyone to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_360" title="360"/>work insanely hard in those early years, the team was able to write Android from scratch and deliver a robust platform and device in time to become relevant in the nascent smartphone industry.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c48-0003">The Right Size</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The small size of the team meant that everyone had to work incredibly hard to finish the project, but it also meant that they were much more efficient.</p>
<p>Ficus talked with Brian Swetland after he started leading the Play Store team, years after 1.0: “He asked how big my team was. I told him 300 people. His eyes popped out, ‘With 300 people you could do a new Android!’</p>
<p>“I said ‘No. With 300 people, you couldn’t—you need 20 people.’ That larger team is riding on the code and practices built by the individuals that had consensus by default. In the early days, with all of the communication and coordination. . . . If you start with a big team, you spend all of your time debating.”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c48-0004">The Right Leadership</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Great teams benefit from great leadership to help everyone gel and drive forward together. One aspect of that leadership was sheltering Android and running it like a startup inside the big mothership of Google. Another aspect was having decisions being made by a single person, not by a group of people.</p>
<p>San Mehat said, “Much like Apple, it really helped to have that visionary asshole type. The one person. Not a committee. Not five people. One person that was like, ‘This is the way I want it, and that’s the way it’s going to be and I don’t care.’ </p>
<p>“Having a single person at the top making these decisions resulted in the team and the product continuing to move toward the goal. It was making a decision, even if it’s not the right one, but just a decision to move the ball forward. You can’t steer if you’re not moving.”</p>

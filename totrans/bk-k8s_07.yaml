- en: Computers have finite processing, storage, and memory, and are built of parts
    that fail, especially at the wrong time. To build a scalable, reliable application,
    we can’t be limited by the resources of a single host or dependent on a single
    point of failure. At the same time, we don’t want to give up the modularity and
    flexibility that containers provide. In [Part II](part02.xhtml#part02), we’ll
    see how Kubernetes meets the essential requirements to run containers across a
    cluster of machines, with cross-host container networking, scalability, automated
    failover, and distributed storage.

<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">A</span>nother boost to the browser team came from across the ocean.</p>
<p>Google’s London engineering office was originally started to work on mobile projects . . . but not on Android. The engineers in London made Google apps and services work on the plethora of mobile platforms and devices available at the time. Prior to the iPhone and Android (and for the first couple of years after they launched), there were many phone platforms being used in the world, and Google wanted to make its apps available on them.</p>
<p>The mobile effort initially began in Mountain View, and attracted engineers such as Cédric Beust,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c18-footnote-1" id="c18-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> who led a team getting Gmail to work on mobile devices. But eventually, Google started a new office in London, with the charge of creating software for Symbian and Windows Mobile, two of the most prevalent mobile OSes at the time.</p>
<p>Andrei Popescu, who worked on that early team,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c18-footnote-2" id="c18-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup> talked about why London was chosen for this work: “In 2007, the core mobile expertise was in Europe, not the US. Europe had 3G well before the US. If you look at the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_182" title="182"/>mobile OSes developed at the time, the center of excellence was in Europe. Symbian<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c18-footnote-3" id="c18-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup> was developed in London, Series 60 and UIQ<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c18-footnote-4" id="c18-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup> were things developed on top of Symbian by Nokia and Ericsson. So Google made a conscious decision to create a mobile center of excellence in London.</p>
<p>“We also did a good job at hiring—London is an excellent place to hire. We can attract talent from all over the world, and there are excellent computer science schools across Europe. And geographically it makes sense,” since London is one of the closest major European cities to California (where Google’s headquarters are located) and there are direct flights between the two.</p>
<p>But the site needed a lead for the mobile effort, so in early 2007 Google hired Dave Burke.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c18-0001">Dave Burke and the London Mobile Team</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Dave Burke was into computers at a young age. He combined a joystick, a photoelectric cell, the magnifying glass from a family projector, a tape recorder, a speech synthesizer, and some code he wrote and created a device that would fire a rubber band at anyone who entered his room. “I was hooked. My poor sister.”</p>
<p>He studied electrical engineering through undergrad and a PhD, after which he ran the engineering team at a startup. By 2007, he decided he wanted more experience than he could get at that small company, so he took a job at Google leading the new mobile team. He wanted to move to Silicon Valley at the time, but London was where the opportunity was.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c18-footnote-5" id="c18-footnoteref-5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2007, there were two distinct mobile efforts happening in London: Mobile search and browser-related work. The team made Google’s software in these areas work on a variety of non-Android devices. On the side, Dave started playing around with Android, learning the APIs and how to program Android apps.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_183" title="183"/>Nine months after Dave joined, the Android SDK went live. There was going to be a large event in London, and Rich Miner asked Dave to give a talk about Android, introducing the SDK to that audience. So Dave did some live coding<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c18-footnote-6" id="c18-footnoteref-6">6</a></sup> in front of the crowd, creating a simple web browser application in eight minutes.</p>
<p>The talk went well and Dave was feeling pretty good about it until the next day. “I got an email from Andy Rubin, going ‘Who the hell is this guy and why is he talking about my project publicly?’” Apparently, Rich hadn’t gotten around to telling Andy that he’d asked Dave to do this.</p>
<p>Dave said, “My relationship with Andy started at a low level. I figured it could only get better from there.” </p>
<p>Over time, the London team started doing more projects for Android. Meanwhile, the apps that Dave’s team was working on were eventually subsumed by the product teams directly (like YouTube). The mobile team was dissolved and Dave’s organization moved into Android.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c18-0002">Andrei Popescu and the London Browser Team</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Andrei Popescu’s team was responsible for London’s mobile browser efforts. He was a natural choice for that project, since that’s what Andrei had worked on at Nokia.</p>
<p>After getting his undergraduate degree in computer science in Bucharest, Romania, Andrei left his home country to get a master’s degree in Helsinki, Finland. He figured he would return to Romania after he got his degree. That was over twenty years ago: “I’m still on that journey.”</p>
<p>After he finished graduate school, in 2002, Andrei landed a job at Nokia, in Helsinki. He was working on an MMS<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c18-footnote-7" id="c18-footnoteref-7">7</a></sup> editor. “I was very depressed: I’d done all this studying in two countries, gotten a master’s degree, and here I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_184" title="184"/>was programming this shitty little thing, couldn’t do much, in a really weird variant of C++ on an operating system that seemed already, for those times, very arcane and bizarre. At the time, I didn’t have the foresight to appreciate that I was working on a technology (mobile) that was going to change the world and also shape my career for the next decades.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, he met Antti Koivisto at Nokia, who was working on something more interesting. “He was working under the radar on a full web browser for Nokia phones, for Symbian, based on a library called WebKit.” They got this working and shipped a full browser application to a very large audience of Nokia users.</p>
<p>After that project, Andrei wanted to move to London. He didn’t care what the job was, he just wanted to relocate. “Google was kind of a dream. But for me, the one motivation at the time was to move to London. I sent hundreds of applications and got one reply: Google.”</p>
<p>Andrei started at Google on the Mobile team in January of 2007. Initially, he worked on a project to get Google Maps working on Nokia phones. But soon he started a project called Lithium, which was meant to be a full web browser for Windows Mobile.</p>
<p>On Andrei’s team were Ben Murdoch (then an intern<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c18-footnote-8" id="c18-footnoteref-8">8</a></sup>), Steve Block, and Nicolas Roard.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c18-0003">Nicolas Roard, Gearing Up</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">After going to university and working at a startup in France, Nicolas began a PhD program in Wales. Eventually the money ran out on the research grant, and “I still needed to feed myself.” So, PhD in hand, Nicolas applied to Google in London and started there in April of 2007, working on Andrei’s Lithium project.</p>
<p>Lithium was an application built on top of the WebKit browser engine. Imagine if the browser you use on your phone didn’t come with the phone, but had to be downloaded as a separate application. The prototype was promising, but . . . huge. Lithium required users to download what was a very large (especially for that time) binary for their phones. The project was killed and Andrei’s team started working on Google Gears instead.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_185" title="185"/>Google Gears was an effort at Google to provide richer capabilities for browsers at that time, such as local storage and geolocation.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c18-footnote-9" id="c18-footnoteref-9">9</a></sup> Gears was eventually discontinued when these capabilities became standard in browsers with HTML5. Gears launched for desktops in 2007, and Andrei’s team made it work on mobile browsers.</p>
<p>At first, the team ported Gears to Windows Mobile. By this time, when the Android SDK launched, it was clear that the Android platform and product would exist at least to some extent. So the team worked on porting Gears to the Android browser. Gears continued to ship as part of the browser until it was finally deprecated in the Donut release, in late 2009; it made more sense to integrate those features directly into the browser instead.</p>
<p>In the early days of Android, Google engineers outside the Android team didn’t just casually contribute code to Android. In fact, they couldn’t; nobody outside of the Android team even had the rights or permission to do so.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c18-footnote-10" id="c18-footnoteref-10">10</a></sup> But the work on Andrei’s team was important enough to the Android platform to include them. Andy granted Andrei’s team full source code access, making them the only team outside of Android with access at that time.</p>
<p>The more that the team worked with the Android browser, the more they just became part of the overall browser team. Andrei’s team focused primarily on forward-looking browser features. For example, they worked on creating and implementing the web standard for geolocation. They also made the video element<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c18-footnote-11" id="c18-footnoteref-11">11</a></sup> (another feature in HTML5) work in the browser.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_186" title="186"/>In 2008, during the run-up to Android 1.0, the VP of the mobile team (Vic Gundotra) disbanded the mobile effort, including Dave Burke’s London team. Mobile projects were absorbed into the individual product teams instead. The landscape of mobile computing and devices had changed radically since the time that the mobile effort was first begun. The iPhone had been out (and popular) since mid-2007, and Android was launching soon. Smartphones were ushering in a new world where mobile apps were going to be increasingly important for the company, and the company was incorporating mobile capabilities more directly into its products.</p>
<p>Dave’s team had proven to be successful and useful to Android, so with the help of Hiroshi Lockheimer, they convinced Andy to bring them all into Android. They dropped the work that they were doing for other platforms and focused entirely on Android engineering efforts.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c18-0004">Android and Web Apps</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Android’s browser and web technology continued to improve, and the team continued to dedicate increasing effort and people to the project. In 2013, the Android browser (and WebView) was replaced by Chrome on Android, when the company decided that having multiple teams and projects focused on similar technology goals probably didn’t make sense. WebView and the browser are still an important part of the mobile technology stack, allowing users to browse rich websites and allowing developers to write applications using web technologies.</p>

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c18-footnoteref-6" id="c18-footnote-6">6.</a></sup>  Writing code live, in real time, is not the typical way people present. It’s much easier to just paste code onto slides and explain it, rather than writing the code and either boring the audience (if there is a lot of it to write) or failing (because the author forgets something simple and ends up with compiler errors that have to be tediously fixed in front of an increasingly frustrated and restless audience). But it can be a great way to demonstrate how simple something is, which was Dave’s goal with that presentation.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c18-footnoteref-7" id="c18-footnote-7">7.</a></sup>  MMS = Multimedia Messaging Service: this is the protocol used whenever pictures are sent in text messages.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c18-footnoteref-8" id="c18-footnote-8">8.</a></sup>  Ben was eventually hired full time and has worked in the London office on Android-related projects ever since.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c18-footnoteref-9" id="c18-footnote-9">9.</a></sup>  Geolocation allows the browser to use the user’s location, if the user grants that permission. It’s useful for things like navigation in mapping apps (if you want to know how to get somewhere, it’s good to know where to start).</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c18-footnoteref-10" id="c18-footnote-10">10.</a></sup>  It’s important to realize that this walled-off situation of Android code was sharply different from code in the rest of Google. For the most part, software at Google is in a single, shared repository, and engineers can easily see, and even contribute to, code in other projects. But the Android code existed elsewhere and was not even viewable, much less changeable, by people who were not on the team.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c18-footnoteref-11" id="c18-footnote-11">11.</a></sup>  The video element allows video content (such as that on YouTube) to play in a browser. This feature was an important change for web browsers, as the main way of playing video in browsers prior to this was through the Adobe Flash plugin. Having video capability built directly into the browser meant that users wouldn’t have to have a plugin installed to watch video content. This was particularly important in mobile devices, where browser plugins like Flash would not necessarily work.</p></aside>

</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="ChapterIntro">While Hollywood depictions typically show ninjas brandishing throwing stars or a katana, real shinobi developed a vast and eclectic array of tools and weapons, and they were instructed to take great care choosing the right tool for the job.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c08-noteref-56" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-56">1</a></sup> All three shinobi scrolls dedicate substantial space to describing secret tools, many of which were innovative technology for their time. <em>Bansenshūkai</em> alone includes five sizeable volumes about tools. It states, among other directives, that the best tools can be used for multiple purposes, are quiet, and are not bulky.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c08-noteref-57" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-57">2</a></sup> <em>Shōninki</em> advises shinobi to limit the number of tools they carry, as any piece of equipment has the potential to arouse <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="64" id="Page_64"/>suspicion if it seems out of place.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c08-noteref-58" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-58">3</a></sup> The scroll also recommends that shinobi seek out and sabotage the tools and weapons of their targets; such instruments were of central importance to a shinobi’s capabilities.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c08-noteref-59" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-59">4</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p>Of course, shinobi did not acquire their tools from any big-box shinobi supply store. Instead, according to the guidance of the scrolls, they made effective tools from items that were easily bought, found, or made. This approach had several advantages. Such everyday items could be carried without attracting much suspicion<sup class="endnote"><a id="c08-noteref-60" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-60">5</a></sup> and even act as corroborating props for shinobi disguises. For example, several rulers, including Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Oda Nobunaga, called for sword hunts—mass confiscations of all swords and other weapons from civilians—in an effort to reduce the ability of rebels to attack the ruling army.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c08-noteref-61" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-61">6</a></sup> Under these conditions, any non-samurai who wore a sword or other armaments in public could expect to have their weapons seized. To bypass this tactic, shinobi discreetly modified common farm implements to be used as weapons, as there was no edict against carrying sharp farm tools in public. In the hands of a trained shinobi, everyday farm tools became lethal.</p>&#13;
<p>For all their practicality, <em>Bansenshūkai</em> asserts that the essential principle of using tools is not simply to wield them but to have an enlightened, Zen-like understanding of their purpose.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c08-noteref-62" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-62">7</a></sup> Shinobi contemplated their tools’ usefulness deeply and frequently, constantly training with them and reimagining their uses in the field. As a result, shinobi regularly improved existing tools, invented new ones, and passed this knowledge on to other, allied shinobi.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c08-noteref-63" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-63">8</a></sup><sup> </sup></p>&#13;
<p>In this chapter, we will contemplate tools. We’ll touch on the dual nature of tools—how the same tool has the capability to do good or bad, depending on its operator. This binary <em>in-yo</em>, or <em>ying-yang</em>, concept is a useful model to understand how a hacker approaches digital tools. For example, consider how a tool designed to help a user might be used for malicious purposes. </p>&#13;
<p>In addition to possessing good-bad potential, each tool can also be repurposed or applied in different ways. Take a moment to think of a dozen or so ways one can use a hammer. Simple thought exercises like this can help deepen your understanding of what exactly a hammer is, how a hammer might be improved, and how a new type of hammer might be invented to accomplish something novel. These same creative skills can be applied to recoding digital and software-based tools. At the highest levels of mastery, this creative repurposing is analogous to the work of a master blacksmith. The blacksmith can forge new tools, machines, and systems that can dramatically change how they think <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="65" id="Page_65"/>about their own craft; open up new possibilities around what they can build; and enhance their capabilities to develop new weapons, defenses, and tools. </p>&#13;
<p>To be clear, the adversarial use of tools is likely a threat we will never fully escape. That said, in this chapter, I will describe the security best practices regarding tools, as well as some enhanced controls that may mitigate attacks. </p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-500549c08-0001">Living Off the Land</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In cybersecurity, <em>tools</em> are any instruments that aid the manual or automated operation of a task. If that sounds like a widely inclusive definition, that’s because it is. There are physical tools, such as BadUSBs, Wi-Fi sniffers, and lockpicks, and there are software tools, such as platforms, exploits, code, scripts, and executables. An entire computer system itself is a tool. A tool can have a legitimate use but, in the hands of a hacker, become a weapon. Think, for example, of the SSH client an administrator uses to perform remote maintenance on systems, which an attacker can use for reverse SSH tunneling to attack systems and bypass firewalls.</p>&#13;
<p>Much like shinobi, cyberadversaries rely heavily on tools to achieve their goals, and they continuously develop, customize, hone, and test their tools against existing technology in the wild. Sophisticated threat groups employ full-time, dedicated tool and capability developers to maintain and improve their tool set. In response, enterprising cyberdefenders work to reverse engineer these custom tools so they can build countermeasures, implement useful security policies and detection signatures, test malicious tool capabilities in sandbox environments, and create application whitelists that identify and block dangerous tools. In some cases, new defenses are so well applied that adversaries cannot download or install their tools to the target system, as the host-based security immediately quarantines the tools, blocks access to them, and alerts security personnel to their presence.</p>&#13;
<p>Because host-based security systems can detect and block specialized tools and malware, many adversaries now practice an infiltration tactic called “living off the land.” Using this approach, attackers first gather intelligence on the software and tools already in use on the target system. Then, they build their attack using only those applications, since the host system’s defenses do not consider those applications harmful. A living-off-the-land attack can use any file on the victim machine’s disk, including the task scheduler, web browser, and Windows Management <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="66" id="Page_66"/>Instrumentation (WMI) Command-Line Utility, as well as scripting engines such as cmd/bat, JavaScript, Lua, Python, and VBScript. Much as shinobi appropriated common items in the target environment, like farm tools, which they knew would be readily available and blend in, hackers, by co-opting what already exists on the target machine, can turn everyday user and admin tools, applications, and operating system files into tools for their purposes. </p>&#13;
<p>One common tool susceptible to exploitation on Windows machines is Microsoft’s potent PowerShell framework. Even Microsoft acknowledges that threat actors regularly target PowerShell to infiltrate systems, perform unauthorized actions, and otherwise compromise an organization’s systems. In turn, Microsoft offers security and mitigation capabilities, such as Privilege Access Management (PAM) to enforce Just Enough Administration (JEA) in combination with Just in Time (JIT) administration. Unfortunately, JEA/JIT turns PowerShell’s ubiquity into an access control nightmare for human IT administrators. How? I’ll spare you the more technical details. Just imagine a technician who is called to come troubleshoot a problem, but is only allowed to bring a screwdriver and can only access that screwdriver between 1:00 and 2:00 <span class="KeyCaps">pm</span>.</p>&#13;
<p>Using access control measures to lock down tools works only if an IT team is willing to severely restrict its own effectiveness. Even then, there’s an inherent danger when these everyday tools exist on the target system—cybersecurity professionals have observed threat actors freeing tools from their local lock with ease. A fact of cybersecurity is this: as long as these sophisticated tools exist, so does the potential to abuse them. </p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-500549c08-0002">Securing Tools</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">The paradox of having tools is that you need them to operate, but so does the adversary. One approach to this challenge is to reduce the number of tools—in terms of quantity, function, access, and availability—to the bare minimum. While this strategy will make it somewhat difficult for you to operate inside your own environment, with adequate security controls, it should make it even <em>more</em> difficult for a potential adversary. One downside to this approach is that you are weakening the resiliency and robustness of your capabilities to remotely manage your environment. So, if an adversary compromises essential tools by removing or breaking them, your own protections may sabotage your ability <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="67" id="Page_67"/>to manage and repair the system. For securing tools, the following steps are a good start:</p>&#13;
<ol class="decimal">&#13;
<li value="1"><em>Determine your baseline.</em> Conduct role-based employee surveys and perform software inventory audits across all systems in your organization. Document a comprehensive list of users, version numbers, and system locations for every tool in your environment, including all software/applications, scripts, libraries, systems, and roles. This includes OS and system files, such as the following:&#13;

</table></li>&#13;
<li value="2"><em>Review your findings and assess your needs. </em>Evaluate every tool to determine which users need it, as well as how, where, and when it is used. For every tool, conduct a risk assessment to determine the potential impact if an adversary gains access. Document how you could restrict a tool’s capabilities to increase security while incorporating justifiable compromises for business operations—for example, disabling macros in Microsoft Word and Excel.</li>&#13;
<li value="3"><em>Implement restrictions.</em> Restrict availability, access, and authorization for unnecessarily risky tools. Document any exceptions and plan to revisit the exceptions every quarter to make users request a renewal of their approval. You could even set temporary access that automatically revokes or deletes tools after a period of time. Establish a whitelist of approved tools so that any unrecognized or unauthorized tools are blocked automatically from being delivered to your systems. Consider physically locking all USB, media, Thunderbolt, FireWire, console, and external ports on all systems, with written approval required to unlock and use them.&#13;

<h2><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="68" id="Page_68"/>Castle Theory Thought Exercise</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Consider the scenario in which you are the ruler of a medieval castle with valuable assets inside. Your estate produces rare, proprietary threads that are necessary for onsite textile construction and repair. They are also sold for considerable sums—income that keeps your domain profitable. You receive credible threat intelligence that a shinobi plans to infiltrate your castle and poison the spindle needle on a spinning wheel, but it is unclear whom they are targeting and what their objective is.</p>&#13;
<p>Model threat scenarios in which someone could be pricked by a spindle needle. Then develop mitigations to lower the probability and impact of the prick. For example, you might dull the needles or make people wear protective gloves in the spinning room. Could you reposition the spinning wheel to make it harder for workers to accidentally bump or graze the needle? What access controls could you place on transporting spindle needles within the castle, and what supply chain protections could you implement on new needles coming in? How many ways can you come up with to prevent the poisoned needle from being used for malicious purposes? What other sharp tools might workers substitute for needles, and should you remove access to them? Could you even redesign the spindle wheel to operate without a needle? </p>&#13;

<h2 id="h1-500549c08-0003">Recommended Security Controls and Mitigations</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Where relevant, recommendations are presented with applicable security controls from the NIST 800-53 standard. Each should be evaluated with the concept of tools in mind.</p>&#13;
<ol class="decimal">&#13;
<li value="1">Evaluate your technical capability to enforce the “principle of least functionality” by disabling, deleting, and restricting access to unnecessary software and system functions in your environment. [CM-7: Least Functionality]</li>&#13;
<li value="2">Conduct periodic reviews of the functions, tools, and software used for each role and system to determine whether they are necessary or whether they could be removed or disabled. Establish a system to register, track, and manage these tools. [CM-7: Least Functionality | (1) Periodic Review | (3) Registration Compliance] </li>&#13;
<li value="3">After documenting every tool that a user or system could leverage, restrict users from putting those tools to use for functions <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="69" id="Page_69"/>outside the user’s role in the organization. [CM-7: Least Functionality | (2) Prevent Program Execution]</li>&#13;
<li value="4">Implement a whitelist or blacklist (or both) of software, applications, and other tools. [CM-7: Least Functionality | (4) Unauthorized Software/Blacklisting | (5) Authorized Software/Whitelisting]</li>&#13;
<li value="5">Implement physical and network boundary restrictions on hardware and software tools. For example, restrict sensitive tools to a segregated management-net file server or in portable locked media devices, to be accessed only when needed and in combination with JEA/JIT access controls. [MA-3: Maintenance Tools | (1) Inspect Tools | (3) Prevent Unauthorized Removal | (4) Restricted Tool Use; SC-7: Boundary Protection | (13) Isolation of Security Tools/Mechanisms/Support Components]</li>&#13;
<li value="6">Evaluate all installed software to determine which imports, APIs, functional calls, and hooks are used by applications known to be safe. Consider using malcode protections to block any tools that use these implementations or others that normal software does not use. Consider your options to restrict, disable, and remove OS functions, modules, components, and libraries that are not used for business operations.

<h2 id="h1-500549c08-0004">Debrief</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, you learned about tools—how powerful they are and why it’s important to keep them safe. You learned about “living off the land” and the complexity of making systems both defensible and functional. You may have also started to ponder the distinctions between tools and malware, as well as how one might program a tool to identify the differences between the two. The thought exercise of the poisoned spindle challenged you to outwit the enemy who’s invading an environment you control. </p>&#13;
<p>In the following chapter, we will discuss different techniques used by shinobi scouts—smelling, seeing, and hearing—and what we can learn from them, particularly as we apply different types of digital sensors in our cyber environment. </p>&#13;

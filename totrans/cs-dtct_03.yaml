- en: Frank shook off Officer Notation and left through the back gate of the farm,
    where a large sign faced the road. For years the Crannocks had used this sign
    to broadcast coded messages about various illegal activities. These days it was
    something of a tourist attraction for visiting criminals—a place thugs took their
    younger protégés and gathered to reminisce about stories that invariably began
    “Back in my day . . .”

- en: The sign itself was an AnyText model. It held 3 arrays of letters, each array
    with 12 slots. Each letter, space, or punctuation mark took up a single slot in
    an array, meaning the board could hold a total of 36 individual characters—enough
    to advertise a whole range of illegal activities. Every Monday morning, one of
    the Crannocks would drag a basket of letters to the sign and individually place
    the appropriate character in each slot of the array.

- en: During his first week on the force, Frank’s partner had brought him out here
    to “check the board.” The message at the time—*Apple picker wanted. Got slugs?*—sounded
    innocuous enough to Frank. The Crannocks were looking for an apple picker to help
    with the harvest and were offering to get rid of people’s slugs. When he said
    this to his partner, a 20-year veteran, she laughed.

    to look beyond the obvious meaning and see what the criminal mind would see. In
    this case, *Apple picker wanted* indicates that they are trying to hire a petty
    thief. Someone who would steal apples from a cart or such.”

    You’ll get to know that one.”

- en: Thus, Frank had learned to check the Crannocks’ board weekly to get a pulse
    on the criminal world. After the first few months, he had learned to decipher
    most of the codes. *Farmhands* meant henchmen, with additional modifiers if strength,
    brutality, or just plain numbers were needed. A *print artist* referred to a forger,
    while a *vocal artist* was a con man, and so forth. The phrase *a flock of chickens*
    had stumped Frank for a few days before Rossile translated it as “a large number
    of warm bodies to run around noisily and cause a distraction; no intelligence
    required.”

- en: By the end of his first year, Frank had become an expert at reading the board.
    The only time in the past few years that Frank had a hard time deciphering a criminal
    tip from the board was during the wizard Exponentious’s attack on the kingdom.
    Exponentious had unleashed the Spell of Incorrect Indexes on all the kingdom’s
    ArrayDesignBoards. As its name implied, the spell changed the indexes, so the
    locations Mrs. Crannock thought she was setting the letters to were wrong. For
    a week, the Crannocks’ board held gibberish.

    was implemented as three separate arrays, Frank had to unscramble each line individually.
    He puzzled out the message: *Defensive wizard wanted*.'

- en: Today, though, the message was clear. In fact, it was the least subtle message
    he had ever seen on the Crannocks’ board. It read *ArrayCarts for rent. No questions*.

- en: Arrays don’t just store lists of numbers; they can also be used to store strings
    of text characters. Many programming languages implement strings using arrays.
    Each block in the array holds a single character, which can be a letter, number,
    symbol, or space. As with arrays of other data, characters in these strings can
    be accessed directly through their index in the array.

    of text *very* well. All standard police forms require officers to record their
    names within a 32-block array at the top of *each* page. In a typical month, you
    will fill in over 400 such arrays.

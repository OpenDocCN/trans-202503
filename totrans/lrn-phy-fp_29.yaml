    such as those in our homes and offices, consists of charge flowing along a wire,
    but it’s also useful to consider the possibility of charge flowing across a surface
    or throughout a volume. These three current distributions—line, surface, and volume—are
    the subject of this chapter.

    the ideas of current, surface current density, and volume current density. We’ll
    then define a data type for current distribution capable of representing a line
    current, a surface current, a volume current, or any combination of these. As
    electric charge is the source of electric fields, so electric current is the source
    of magnetic fields. We’ll show how to calculate the magnetic dipole moment of
    any current distribution, and we’ll discuss similarities and differences with
    the electric dipole moment of a charge distribution. Having a good language for
    current distributions prepares us for the next chapter, in which we’ll find the
    magnetic field produced by a current distribution.

    But in 1820, Hans Christian Oersted showed that current was also a magnetic phenomenon,
    establishing the first connection between electricity and magnetism. Modern electromagnetic
    theory views current as the fundamental source of magnetic field.

- en: In other words, electric current is the fundamental quantity responsible for
    magnetic effects (although this took thousands of years to discover after magnetic
    phenomena were first observed) and plays a key role in electromagnetic theory.
    We use three types of current distributions. First, there is current flowing along
    a one-dimensional path such as a line or a curve, which we often refer to simply
    as *current*. The SI unit for current is the ampere, or amp (A). An ampere of
    current in a wire means that 1 Coulomb of charge is passing a fixed point on the
    wire in each second. We typically use the symbol *I* for current. By convention,
    current is the flow of positive charge. The convention was established before
    people knew that it’s the negatively charged electrons in metals that are free
    to move and conduct current. Electrons that are flowing to the left produce a
    current to the right in our convention.

    In this case, we speak of the *surface current density* **K**, meaning the current
    per unit of cross-sectional length. The SI unit for surface current density is
    the ampere per meter (A/m).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, there is current flowing throughout a three-dimensional volume. In this
    case, we speak of the *volume current density* **J**, meaning the current per
    unit of cross-sectional area. The SI unit for volume current density is the ampere
    per square meter (A/m²). [Table 26-1](ch26.xhtml#ch26tab1) summarizes these current
    distributions.

    the parameter *ϕ* must go through 2*πnL* radians from start to finish. We set
    the limits for *ϕ* to be from – *πnL* to *πnL* so that the solenoid will be centered

    the current in one wire times the number of turns per unit length. The direction
    of the surface current density is ![Image](Images/sdcap.jpg), so the surface current
    density is ![Image](Images/511equ01.jpg), which is given in the code as `\r ->
    (n*i) *^ phiHat r`. The surface is a cylinder, parameterized by the cylindrical
    coordinates *ϕ* and *z*. The limits for *ϕ* are 0 to 2*π*, although we could have
    chosen – *π* to *π* and achieved the same result. The limits for *z* are – *L*/2
    to *L*/2\. We need to use the function `const` because a surface requires limits
    on the second parameter that are functions of the first parameter. If the turns
    are close together, the wire solenoid will produce a very similar magnetic field

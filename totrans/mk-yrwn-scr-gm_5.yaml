    sure you have a favorite song! People have been making music and noise for thousands
    of years, and in this chapter, you’ll learn how to do some amazing things with
    music and sound in your games. So how do games use sound?

    collected a treasure or gotten chomped by a monster? In *Weird Bug Chowdown* in
    [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#ch02), whenever the bug touches something, good or bad,
    the game plays a sound effect. Sound lets the player know something important
    has taken place. It also shapes how they feel about what’s happened. That’s why
    eating a berry produces a hearty “chomp” sound and touching a bad berry or a poop
    produces an “eww.”'

    movie. What was the music like? Was it fast and energetic? Did it make you feel
    excited? What about the music in a sad scene? Was it slow and moody? Music affects
    how we feel about what happens while we’re listening to it, and the same is true
    in games. Many of the games you play probably have light, boppy music that creates
    a playful mood. Would you feel differently about what was happening in these games
    if the music was heavy and sad?'

    effects with sfxr. Third, you’ll learn how to compose short music loops using
    Drum Circle.

    waveforms, more options, and more features in general. One useful bfxr feature
    is that it keeps track of all the new sounds you create using the Generator and
    Randomize buttons. So if you want to go back to a sound you generated earlier,
    you can. You probably won’t need most of the new options in bfxr unless sfxr doesn’t
    provide enough features for the sounds you want to create. You can download the
    tool at *[https://www.bfxr.net/](https://www.bfxr.net/)*.

    jam is probably only a couple of minutes long. In games, it’s often impossible
    to tell how long a song needs to play. Each player takes a different amount of
    time to finish the game. Some will finish very quickly, and others will spend
    a long time exploring.
  prefs: []

    Instead, it wraps back around to the beginning and keeps going. That way, the

    an old submarine radar screen. (Maybe you’ve seen one in a movie.) As the line
    (or *sweep* in radar parlance) moves around the circle, it plays the notes that
    it touches. By placing notes in the circle, you decide which notes are played.

    innermost circle has 4 spots (a quarter of 16 and half of 8). These inner spots
    are guidelines that will help us make our loop. If we play a note 16 times in
    the outer circle, it produces a very fast beat. If we play a note 8 times in the
    second circle, it’ll be slower, playing it half as often. Playing a note 4 times
    in the inner circle is slowest of all.

    the snare drum, which looks like a hammer with legs and is immediately to the
    left of the hand clap. Because we want a beat that’s not too fast or too slow,
    let’s add our snare to the middle circle, the one with 8 dots. Drag a snare icon
    to each of the 8 dots.

    dots. Try adding a snare right before one of the snares we already have.

    per loop, every 8 steps (or every 4 drum beats). *Dum, dum, dum, dah-dum, dum,
    dum, dum, dah-dum*. That divides our loop into two halves, which gives us a good
    starting place to add more sounds.

    add them to the loop. After the *dah-dum* is a good place. We use the hand clap

    The GNU project is the oldest free software project in the world, and, in fact,
    this project founded the concept of free software. Initiated in 1983 by Richard
    M. Stallman, who desired a Unix-like operating system without any constraint regarding
    its freedom of use, change, and distribution, the project began by building all
    the necessary components but the kernel. This last has since been supplied by
    the Linux kernel. The intended GNU kernel, called Hurd, is still in alpha state.
    Remember that GIMP is an acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program.'

    This software was initially the GIMP Toolkit, the widget toolkit used in implementing
    GIMP. Since its beginning, it has developed to the point of being one of the most
    important toolkits in GNU/Linux. For example, it is the basis of the GNOME desktop
    environment and is now object oriented (hence the name GTK+), and it has been
    ported to other operating systems like Windows and Mac OS X.'

    General Public License (GPL), the most widely used license in the world of free
    software. A software product licensed using the GPL offers the four fundamental
    freedoms: freedom to run the program for any purpose, freedom to study how the
    program works and adapt it to your own needs, freedom to redistribute copies so
    you can help your neighbor, and freedom to improve the program and release your
    improvements to the public so the whole community benefits. Importantly, these
    freedoms cannot be denied by somebody redistributing the program.'

- en: '*[www.gegl.org](http://www.gegl.org)* is the official site of the Generic Graphic
    Library, a graph-based image-processing framework. In the current version of GIMP,
    images are represented as arrays of pixels. When you edit an image, you change
    the pixels, and there is no way to return to the unchanged image other than opening
    a previously saved copy: This is called *destructive editing*. With GEGL, images
    are represented as graphs, in which the edges are image components and nodes are
    operations on these components. By changing the structure of the graph, you can
    perform nondestructive editing. Moreover, this representation offers provisions
    for representing images in higher bit depth than the current 8 bits. GEGL operations
    are already usable in GIMP 2.8, but only GIMP 2.10 or 3.0 will fully benefit from
    the incorporation of GEGL.'

			</header>
			<p class="BodyFirst"><span class="DropCap">S</span>oftware development should be planned and tracked. Your teammates want to know what you’re working on so they can collaborate with you effectively. Teams need to track progress so they can plan future work and course-correct as new information is discovered during development. Without a deliberate process, projects drag on, outside demands steal focus, and operational issues distract developers.</p>
			<p><em>Agile development</em>, a software development methodology, is widely adopted to deliver quality software quickly. Understanding the core philosophy and the goals of common Agile processes such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, reviews, and retrospectives will help you use them effectively. This chapter introduces you to Agile planning basics and key practices of Scrum (a commonly adopted Agile framework), so you can hit the ground running.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c12-0001"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_218" title="218"/>The Agile Manifesto</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">To make sense of Agile development practices, you must first understand the Agile philosophy. Agile was born in 2001 from collaboration between leaders in previous development processes such as Extreme Programming, Scrum, Feature-Driven Development, and Pragmatic Programming. The creators of the Agile process wrote the <em>Agile Manifesto</em> (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">https://agilemanifesto.org/</a>) to describe the core tenets that undergird the process:</p>
			<blockquote class="blockquote trade">
				<p class="Blockquote">We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:</p>
				<p class="Blockquote2"><b>Individuals and interactions</b> over processes and tools</p>
				<p class="Blockquote2"><b>Working software</b> over comprehensive documentation</p>
				<p class="Blockquote2"><b>Customer collaboration</b> over contract negotiation</p>
				<p class="Blockquote2"><b>Responding to change</b> over following a plan</p>
				<p class="Blockquote">That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				The manifesto sounds a little quirky, but it gets at some important points. Agile practices focus on collaboration with teammates and customers; recognizing, accepting, and incorporating change; and focusing on iterative improvement over big-bang development releases. Agile is usually contrasted with <em>Waterfall</em>, an out-of-fashion practice where projects get exhaustively planned at their inception.</p>
			<p>Ironically, once Agile became popular, black-belt ninjas, certifications, and process consultants overran some organizations. People got obsessed with the “right” way to “do Agile,” often to the detriment of the very first principle: “individuals and interactions over processes and tools.”</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c12-0002">Agile Planning Frameworks</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Scrum and Kanban are the two most common Agile planning frameworks. <em>Scrum</em>, the most popular, encourages short iterations with frequent <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_219" title="219"/>checkpoints to adjust plans. Development work is broken into <em>sprints</em>. Sprint length varies, with two weeks being most common. At the beginning of a sprint, each team has a <em>sprint planning</em> meeting to divvy up work, which is captured in <em>user stories</em> or <em>tasks</em>. After planning, developers start on their work. Progress is tracked in a <em>ticketing</em> or <em>issue</em> system. A brief <em>stand-up</em> meeting takes place every day to share updates and call out problems. After each sprint, teams perform a <em>retrospective</em> to review finished work, discuss new findings, look at key metrics, and fine-tune the process. <em>Retrospectives (retros)</em> inform the next sprint’s planning session, creating a feedback cycle from plan to development to retrospective and back to plan.</p>
			<p><em>Kanban</em> does not use fixed-length sprints like Scrum. Instead, Kanban defines workflow stages through which all work items transition (for example, backlog, planning, implementation, testing, deployment, rollout). Teams often customize Kanban stages to fit their needs. Kanban limits <em>work in progress (WIP)</em> by limiting the number of tasks in each stage. By limiting ticket count, teams are forced to finish existing tasks before taking on new work. Kanban boards are dashboards with vertical columns for each workflow stage. Tasks, represented by titled boxes, are moved between columns as status changes. Kanban boards visualize in-flight work and identify problems like piled-up work in a certain stage. If the board shows that a lot of work is stuck in the testing stage, for example, the team might make an adjustment by shifting some of the development work to a backlog, freeing up engineers to help with testing. Kanban works best for teams like support engineers and SREs that handle a large number of incoming requests rather than longer-term projects.</p>
			<p>
				Teams rarely implement the “platonic ideal” of Scrum or Kanban; they pick and choose some practices and alter or ignore others. Whether your organization practices Scrum, Kanban, a mashup of the two called <em>Scrumban</em> (that’s a real thing!), or some other variant of Agile, the planning process should be in service of delivering useful software to happy customers. Stay focused on the goals rather than the mechanics. Experiment and measure the results; keep what works and drop the rest.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c12-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_220" title="220"/>Scrum</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Most software teams practice some form of Scrum, so you’ll need to understand how it works. All planning usually begins with prework. Developers and product managers create new <em>user stories</em>, and tickets from the <em>backlog</em> are <em>triaged</em>. Stories are assigned <em>story points</em> to estimate their complexity and are broken into <em>tasks</em>. Larger stories are designed and researched with <em>spike</em> stories. During <em>sprint planning</em>, the team chooses which stories to complete during the next sprint, using story points to prevent overcommitting.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c12-0001">User Stories</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">A user story is a specific kind of ticket that defines a feature request from a user’s perspective, in the format “As a &lt;user&gt;, I &lt;want to&gt; &lt;so that&gt;.” Here’s an example: “As an administrator, I want to grant viewer permissions to my accountants so that they can see incoming billing statements.” Writing user-centric descriptions keeps the focus on delivering user value.</p>
			<p>A common misuse of user stories is to jam a regular task description into a story, as in “As a developer, I need to upgrade the shader plugin to version 8.7” or “As a user, I want the privacy policy to show up in the footer.” A story like this misses the whole point. Why does the shader plugin need to be updated, what is the value this brings, and who wants it? Does a “user” want the policy, or does the compliance officer? If you are going to bother writing stories as opposed to tasks, write good ones.</p>
			<p>
				Stories usually have attributes beside their title and description. The two most common are <em>estimates</em> and <em>acceptance criteria</em>. User story estimates are a guess at the effort a story takes to implement. Acceptance criteria define when a story is complete. Acceptance criteria keep developers, product managers, QA, and users on the same page. Try to write explicit tests for each acceptance criteria.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The administrator permission page lists the “billing statements” option.</li>
				<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_221" title="221"/>Nonadministrator-granted “billing statements” viewer permission can see all of the account’s billing statements.</li>
				<li>The Edit button is hidden on the billing statement page for nonadministrator accounts.</li>
				<li>Nonadministrators with viewer permission are unable to edit billing statements.</li>
				<li>Nonadministrators with editor and viewer billing statement permissions are able to both see and edit billing statements.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Small stories often double as work tickets, while larger stories are linked to implementation tickets or subtasks. Stories that are ambiguous or need design are spiked. A spike is a time-bounded investigation that enables other stories to be completed. Spikes deliver a design doc, a build-versus-buy decision, an assessment of trade-offs, and so on. See Chapter 10 for more on design.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c12-0002">Tasks</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">A single story may need to be broken down into smaller tasks to estimate how long it will take, to share the work between multiple developers, and to track implementation progress. A good trick for breaking down work is to write very detailed descriptions. Read over the description and find all of the tasks.</p>
			<blockquote class="blockquote trade">
				<p class="Blockquote">We need to add a <var>retry</var> parameter to <var>postProfile</var>. Right now, profiles don’t update if a network timeout occurs. We’ll probably want to cap the retries and add exponential backoff so we don’t block for too long; need to talk with product to find out how long they’re willing to wait for a profile post to complete.</p>
				<p class="Blockquote">Once implemented, we should do both unit and integration tests. We should simulate real network timeouts in the integration tests to verify backoff is working correctly.</p>
				<p class="Blockquote"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_222" title="222"/>After testing, we need to deploy to our testing environment, then production. In production, we should probably split the traffic and ramp the retry behavior slowly, since <var>postProfile</var> is pretty sensitive.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Something as simple as adding a <code>retry</code> parameter to a network post actually has many steps: solidifying the specification with product managers, coding, unit testing, integration testing, deploying, and ramping. Breaking this work into subtasks helps track and coordinate all the steps.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c12-0003">Story Points</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The team’s work capacity is measured in <em>story points</em>, an agreed-upon sizing unit (measured in hours, days, or “complexity”). A sprint’s capacity is the number of developers multiplied by the story points per developer; for example, a team with 4 engineers and 10 points per engineer would have a 40-point capacity. User-story time estimates are also defined in story points; the sum of all story points in a sprint should not be greater than a sprint’s capacity.</p>
			<p>Many teams use time-based allocations where a single point amounts to one workday. Day-based estimates usually account for nontask work—meetings, interruptions, code reviews, and so on—by defining a workday as four hours long.</p>
			<p>Others define story points by task complexity, using a T-shirt size approach: one point is extra small, two points is small, three points is medium, five points is large, and eight points is extra large. Recognize the pattern? It’s the Fibonacci sequence! Incrementing story points according to the Fibonacci sequence helps remove some of the quibbling about 3 versus 3.5 points. Having some gaps between point values also forces teams to make harder decisions about whether an item is big or small, not mediumish. The increase in the size of gaps for more complex tasks accounts for estimation inaccuracy in larger work.</p>
			<p>
				Agile framework doctrine frowns upon time-based estimations. Practitioners claim that dates have emotional attachment and don’t <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_223" title="223"/>represent complexity. Nontime units can make it easier to express uncertainty. Changing a single method might seem like a small amount of work, but if that method is incredibly complex, it might require a lot of effort. It’s mentally easier to say “This is a medium-complexity task” than “This will take me three full days of work.”</p>
			<p>People get very passionate about using time versus complexity for points, as well as their overall usefulness. We haven’t found arguments on this topic to be very productive and recommend adopting whatever is most effective for your team.</p>
			<p>
				Estimating story points is subjective; people tend to be poor estimators. One way to improve estimation accuracy is to use <em>relative sizing</em> to derive the values. Relative sizing is done by defining story points for tasks that have already been finished and then comparing the finished task to one that hasn’t yet been worked on. If the unfinished task is less work, then it’s probably fewer points; more work is probably more points; and if the tasks are similar, then they should be assigned the same value. Processes like <em>planning poker</em> are sometimes used, but even if you don’t take part in them, looking at finished work will give you a feel for your team’s story point values.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c12-0004">Backlog Triage</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Backlog triage</em> or <em>grooming</em> (in the tree-trimming sense) usually takes place before planning meetings. The backlog is a list of candidate stories. Triage is used to keep it fresh, relevant, and prioritized. Product managers read over the backlog with the engineering manager and sometimes with the developers. New stories are added, outdated stories are closed, incomplete stories are updated, and high-priority work is moved to the top of the backlog. A well-groomed backlog will drive planning meeting discussions.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c12-0005">Sprint Planning</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">A sprint planning meeting is held once prework is done. Planning meetings are collaborative; engineering teams work with product managers to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_224" title="224"/>decide what to work on. Prioritized stories are discussed, and engineers work with product managers to determine what will fit into the sprint’s capacity.</p>
			<p>Sprint capacity is determined by looking at how much was completed in previous sprints. Each sprint capacity is further refined during sprint planning as team members join or leave, go on vacation, or enter or exit on-call rotations.</p>
			<p>The most important feature of a sprint is that it’s short—usually two weeks. Short sprints make pushing out work doable since the work need only be pushed out at most a week or two. Small sprints force teams to break down large tasks into smaller ones. Small tasks are better because they’re easier to understand and estimate. Breaking work into small tasks also allows more than one developer to work on a project simultaneously. Smaller development cycles with frequent touch points—stand-ups and reviews—mean problems surface earlier.</p>
			<p>Sprints are considered locked once sprint planning is done. New work that surfaces during the sprint should not be pulled in; it should be pushed to the backlog and planned for a future sprint. Locking sprints lets developers focus on their work and brings predictability. When unplanned work does get pulled in, the team is expected to look into the reasons during the retrospective, with an eye to reducing unplanned work in the future.</p>
			<p>Strict adherence to sprint planning practices is uncommon. Most teams pick and choose what they do; some do prework in the sprint planning meeting, and others have no product managers—developers define all work. Many teams don’t use user stories, opting instead for task or bug tickets with more open-ended formats. Expect variation from team to team.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c12-0004">Stand-ups</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">After sprint planning is complete, work begins, and the team holds <em>stand-up meetings</em>, also called <em>scrum meetings</em> or <em>huddles</em>. Stand-ups keep everyone apprised of your progress, keep you accountable and focused, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_225" title="225"/>and give the team an opportunity to react to anything that puts sprint goals in danger.</p>
			<p>Stand-ups are usually 15-minute meetings scheduled every morning (quick enough to stand through, though actual standing is optional). In the meeting format, teammates go around a circle and give an update on what they have worked on since the last stand-up, what they plan to work on going forward, and whether they’ve found any issues that can delay or derail the sprint. Though in-person stand-ups are the most common, some teams adopt an asynchronous format. In an asynchronous stand-up, the same update is submitted to a chatbot or group email on a daily cadence.</p>
			<p>
				Stand-ups are a regular system check—the glance at your car’s dashboard to ensure that you have gas and that its mysterious “check engine” light is not on. Updates should be fast; they are not a place for troubleshooting. Try to limit your comments on progress to just the bare essentials and raise any issues that you have. Announce discoveries, too; bugs that you discovered, unexpected behavior you found, and so on. Discussion about your discoveries can then happen in the <em>parking lot</em> (not the literal parking lot, of course).</p>
			<p>If your team holds synchronous stand-ups, do your best to be on time. If your stand-ups involve updating the status on tickets or issues, try your best to update tickets assigned to you beforehand. When reading or listening to others’ updates, you’re looking for opportunities to help de-risk sprint completion: if someone says that a ticket is taking longer than expected, volunteer to help if you have spare time.</p>
			<p>Parking lot discussions happen after the meeting. It’s a way to keep the stand-ups brief and make sure that the discussions are relevant to everyone attending. When someone says to “save it for the parking lot,” they’re saying to stop the discussion and pick it up after the stand-up with interested parties.</p>
			<p>Skipping the meeting when scheduling conflicts arise is acceptable. Ask your manager how to provide and get updates if you need to miss a stand-up. Asynchronous stand-ups are skipped less often.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_226" title="226"/>There are many variations of stand-ups and scrums. You might catch phrases like <em>scrum of scrums</em> or <em>Scrumban</em>. Scrum of scrums is a model where a leader from each individual scrum meeting is selected to go to a second scrum where all the teams get together to report on their team progress and call out interdependencies between each other. Scrum of scrums are common in operations, where each team sends an engineer (usually the on-call) to an operations scrum to keep apprised of operational issues. Scrumban is an amalgamation of Scrum and Kanban. The important thing with all of this is to understand how your team and organization work, and to work within that framework.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c12-0005">Reviews</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">A review happens between each sprint. Reviews are usually broken into two parts: demonstrations and project review. During demonstrations, everyone on the team shows the progress they’ve made in the sprint. Afterward, the current sprint is evaluated against its goal. Successful sprints will meet their goals and have a high story-completion rate.</p>
			<p>Review meeting structures vary widely. For some teams, demonstrations are the emphasis of the meeting, while other teams focus only on project status reviews. Many teams don’t even have reviews. If your team has review meetings, take them seriously; provide real feedback and take pride in the work you’ve done. The value you get from reviews matches the effort you put into them.</p>
			<p>It’s standard to keep reviews to no more than one hour per sprint week—a two-week sprint would have a two-hour sprint review. Everyone gathers around desks or in a conference room for demonstrations. Teammates take turns showing what they’ve worked on. The meeting is kept informal. Afterward, sprint goals are reviewed and evaluated for completion.</p>
			<p>
				Don’t overprepare for sprint reviews. Spend a few minutes figuring out what you’re going to show, and make sure your ticket statuses are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_227" title="227"/>accurate. Demonstrations are informal, so avoid formal presentations or speeches.</p>
			<p>Reviews celebrate team wins, create unity, give feedback opportunities, and keep teams honest about progress. Not all developers in a team work on the same set of projects, so reviews help teammates keep up with what others are doing. Keeping teammates in sync gives everyone the opportunity to give feedback and to recognize great work; it creates cohesion. Project status reviews also help teams agree on what is truly “done” and how they are progressing toward their goals. Issues that are discovered can be discussed in sprint retrospectives.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c12-0006">Retrospectives</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">One of the 12 principles in the Agile Manifesto says, “At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.” Retrospective meetings address this principle.</p>
			<p>In a retrospective, a team gets together to talk about what has and hasn’t gone well since the last retrospective. The meeting normally has three phases: sharing, prioritization, and problem solving.</p>
			<p>
				The leader (or <em>scrum master</em>) will kick off a retrospective by asking everyone to share what worked and what didn’t during the last sprint. Everyone participates, and the scrum master keeps a list on the whiteboard or in a shared document. Teammates then discuss the priority of the items that haven’t worked well—which are causing the most pain? Finally, the team brainstorms ways to address the highest priority problems.</p>
			<p>Don’t be afraid to change things. Agile development practices are meant to be malleable; it’s in the manifesto: “Individuals and interactions over process and tools.” Spend a few minutes before each retrospective to think about what would make your team better. Share your thoughts at the meeting.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_228" title="228"/>Retrospectives and reviews often get confused. Reviews are focused on the work done in a sprint, while retrospectives focus on process and tooling. Retrospectives normally take place between sprints, often right after review meetings. Many teams combine a review, a retrospective, and a sprint planning meeting into a single meeting at the beginning of each sprint. A combined meeting is fine as long as each step—review, retro, and planning—is discretely addressed.</p>
			<p>Retrospectives are also one of the reasons Agile comes in so many flavors. Teams are encouraged to reevaluate and adjust their processes frequently. Constant adjustment means no two teams practice Agile quite the same way.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c12-0007">Roadmaps</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Two-week sprints are a good way to get small- and medium-sized work done, but larger projects need more advanced planning. Customers have delivery dates that developers need to stick to, the business needs to know which teams need more engineers, and large technical projects need to be broken down, planned, and coordinated.</p>
			<p>Managers use product roadmaps for long-term planning. Roadmaps are typically broken into quarters: January through March, April through June, July through September, and October through December.</p>
			<p>Planning takes place before each quarter begins. Engineering managers, product managers, engineers, and other stakeholders all convene to discuss upcoming goals and work. Planning usually involves a series of meetings and multiple rounds of discussion.</p>
			<p>
				According to <em>The Papers of Dwight David Eisenhower</em>, Volume XI, Eisenhower said, “In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable” (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1984). This applies to roadmaps. We’ve never seen a yearly or even quarterly roadmap be 100 percent accurate; this isn’t the point. Roadmaps should encourage everyone to think long-term about what the team <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_229" title="229"/>is building; they’re not meant to be static and reliable documents about what the team will build nine months later. Quarters that are farther away should be fuzzier, while quarters that are closer should be more accurate. Don’t fool yourself into thinking any quarter is 100 percent accurate.</p>
			<p>Unlike sprints, which are locked, roadmaps are meant to evolve. Customer requirements will change, and new technical problems will arise. This is where sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives help; they let you adjust your plan based on new information. Communication is critical when changing roadmaps. Dependent teams should be notified early that work is getting shuffled or dropped.</p>
			<p>Many companies go through yearly planning cycles. Managers spend the last quarter of each year trying to plan the next four quarters of work for the upcoming year. Yearly planning is mostly theater—horse-trading and negotiating. Nonetheless, yearly planning cycles often drive “resource allocation” or “head count numbers”—corporate speak for where newly hired engineers end up. Annual planning usually focuses on large projects that account for a significant percentage of a team’s time. Don’t stress out if a project you are excited about isn’t mentioned; ask your manager where the project stands at the end of the planning process.</p>

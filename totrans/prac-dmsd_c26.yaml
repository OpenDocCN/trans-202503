- en: This may seem like an oddly militaristic introduction to self-defense, but what’s
    true for large armies also holds true for individuals. Very few people who threaten
    to harm others actually have violence as their goal; it’s a means to an end, and
    given the inherent risks of combat, it’s one they’d often rather *not* exercise.
    If a mugger or a home invader brings a weapon with them, it’s almost always just
    to make the victims turn over their belongings without too much of a fuss. It
    follows that to turn the tables on an assailant, the victim usually doesn’t need
    to resort to lethal force. Displaying a reciprocal ability to cause serious harm
    can be enough. This demonstration can be purely visual too; for example, seeing
    the muzzle of a gun or the blade of a kitchen knife is sufficient to make most
    burglars reconsider their plans.

    your bluff, the situation can quickly take a turn for the worse. As such, when
    you signal the willingness to cause harm in self-defense, even if just to dissuade
    a potential attack, you should carefully evaluate the odds and be ready to follow
    through—and ideally, know how to do so within the bounds of the law.

- en: In most situations, it’s unlawful to use force, or credibly threaten to use
    force, to harm another person. That said, legal systems around the world recognize
    that the defense of life and limb is a valid excuse for taking many actions that
    would otherwise violate the law, possibly all the way to homicide.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the same time, in most jurisdictions, several fairly specific conditions
    must be met in order for such a legal excuse to succeed. The first nearly universal
    requirement is *innocence.* The situation that led to the use of force must not
    be a consequence of your own unlawful or reckless behavior—say, deliberately starting
    a fight. Of course, this rule is applied with considerable nuance. For example,
    in some places, if you try to disengage and walk away from a brawl of your doing,
    those pursuing you may now be in the wrong, and you might be able to lawfully
    fend them off. Still, it’s best not to put yourself in situations where your freedom
    would hinge on finer legal points of this sort.
  prefs: []

- en: The second component of lawful self-defense is a rational fear of *imminent
    harm*. You must reasonably believe that there’s an immediate and serious risk
    of injury or death. In many jurisdictions, especially in the United States, you
    don’t need to be objectively right. If you mistook a toy pistol for a real gun,
    for example, you might still be cleared in court. On the other hand, you can’t
    beat up another person just because they voiced a vague threat (“I’ll kill you!”)
    but didn’t start making good on that plan.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third prong present in most legal systems is *proportionality.* Your actions
    must be commensurate with the severity of the threat and must cease once the immediate
    danger ends. A grown man can’t viciously beat a small child; a fleeing robber
    typically can’t be shot in the back. Beyond such egregious examples, in the United
    States, this rule is usually applied in a fairly relaxed fashion, recognizing
    that not every decision is perfectly measured in the heat of the moment. As a
    morbid example, few people get in trouble for emptying half a magazine into an
    armed felon, even if a single shot might have theoretically stopped the threat.
    In countries with a dimmer view of self-defense, such as the United Kingdom, proportionality
    is often dissected with much greater zeal.

- en: The final element, found only in some judicial systems, is the *duty to retreat.*
    The law may compel the victim to try to get away from the assailant, allowing
    the use of force only if there’s no safe way to escape. In the United States,
    such laws are fairly rare. As far as I can tell, no state requires you to run
    away from your own home, but a limited duty to retreat in other situations is
    present in several states in the Northeast, plus in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Nebraska,
    and Hawaii.

    the right to posses or carry weapons is a wholly different animal, with drastic
    differences in various parts of the world. On one end of the spectrum, some governments
    take the position that the desire to fight off potential attacks isn’t a legitimate
    reason to possess *any* dangerous tools, even as benign as pepper spray.

    the United Kingdom, readers are advised that “the only fully legal self-defence
    product at the moment is a rape alarm” and that it would be illegal to possess
    “a product made or adapted to cause a person injury” in public—or even privately
    in some circumstances.^([1](b02.xhtml#c26-endnote-1)) The government’s intention
    is to reduce the number of drunken brawls or other confrontations that end in
    severe injury. Yet it must be noted that without access to any equalizing defensive
    tools such as pepper spray, the law of the street is that *might is right*: a
    pack of athletic males may terrorize frailer citizens with relatively few worries
    in mind.'

    spray appears to be allowed everywhere and subject to few practical restrictions.
    Stun guns, on the other hand, require firearm licenses in Massachusetts and Illinois.
    As hinted in Chapter 20, knife carry laws are typically permissive, but a mess
    of obscure municipal and state rules restrict specific blade shapes, opening mechanisms,
    and so forth. The American Knife & Tool Institute maintains a good catalog of
    the rules at *https://www.akti.org/state-knife-laws/*. It gets even more confusing
    when it comes to exotic arms. In California and Massachusetts, for example, the
    possession of nunchucks may land you in jail, but carrying a medieval maul appears
    to be okay.

    As of this writing, the vast majority of US states and counties either practice
    *constitutional carry* (allowing most individuals to carry a concealed or openly
    displayed gun without needing any kind of government-issued permit) or have permitting
    regimes that are by law or in practice *shall issue* (permits are swiftly granted

    will follow you even when you must go through metal detectors and walk past “no

    but most lack the multiyear commitment to truly hone their skills. It’s also important
    to be realistic about what martial arts can and cannot do. Real life isn’t an
    action film, and if the assailant is armed, all someone might be doing with their
    impressive karate moves is bringing fists to a knife fight.

    deterrent effect coming from a petite woman or a nerdy dude with pool noodles
    for arms, even if they’re incredibly skilled. The assailant might not be inclined
    to back off until the fight starts and they realize they’re facing a pro. This
    may sound like an acceptable trade-off, except the outcome of a fight is never
    certain. The attacker may turn out to be quite skilled too and able to land some
    good blows, or perhaps they’re clutching a knife just out of sight.

    rewarding pursuit, but they might not be the simplest, the safest, nor the most
    dependable way to get out of trouble. They can augment your strategy but probably
    shouldn’t be the only trick up your sleeve. For those interested in pursuing hand-to-hand

- en: In situations where defensive weapons are permissible, there are clear merits
    to implements that are designed to repel or immobilize assailants, rather than
    cause them grievous harm. For one, such equipment may be safer to hand over to
    inexperienced users, including teenage kids. The rules for the purchase or possession
    of such tools may be considerably less stringent as well. Last but not least,
    although the legal bar for the use of force may not be very different for lethal
    and less-lethal weapons, the practical consequences of wrongfully shooting someone
    are far more serious than the consequences of making their eyes itch.^([*](#c26-footnote-2))
  prefs: []

- en: On the note of itchy eyes, pepper spray is by far the most versatile and dependable
    less-lethal defense tool out there. It’s inexpensive, compact, easy to use, and
    difficult to resist. Just as important, a single can is enough to hit multiple
    targets from a reasonably safe distance of about 10 feet. The final perk is that
    the spray also works against aggressive dogs and many other animals. About the
    only drawback is that the weapon becomes less effective in strong wind, with some
    risk of blowback toward the user or innocent bystanders. This problem is less
    pronounced with gel-based products that expel a narrow stream of liquid rather
    than a cloud.

    It’s not a gun, and it doesn’t knock people out. It can be thought of as a pain
    compliance device, much like a cattle prod. When pressed against the body of the
    assailant, it causes an intensely unpleasant sensation. Although the current does
    cause some muscle contraction, almost as soon as the contact is broken, the perp
    is back in the game, hopefully less enthused about continuing the assault.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because of the need to get up close, the inability to take on multiple assailants
    in rapid succession, and the possibility of clothing getting in the way, stun
    guns seem to me as vastly inferior to pepper spray. An exception can be made for
    actual gun-like devices, such as the Taser pistols used by the police and sometimes
    available to civilians. These weapons expel barb-like electrodes and long wires
    to deliver a continuous shock to subjects 15 feet away or more. But Tasers are
    rather expensive and bulky—and you get only one or two chances to hit the attacker
    before needing to reload.

    yet to find one that deserves a serious note. In the United States, you can buy
    plastic “firearms” that expel bits of rock salt or paintballs filled with pepper
    gel, supposedly with unpleasant effects if you manage to hit a delicate part.
    More seriously but less conveniently, a regular pump-action shotgun can be loaded
    with riot-control rubber slugs or bean bags. The impact is incredibly painful—but
    it’s strictly a home defense weapon, not a gadget to carry around town.

    are verboten, air rifles capable of firing tiny skin-piercing metal pellets seem
    to be the less-lethal weapon of choice. To me, that’s an unconvincing approach.
    Getting hit by a pellet is unpleasant and occasionally dangerous, but in most
    cases, it serves to anger the assailant, not stop them in their tracks.^([*](#c26-footnote-3))
    In the same vein, a bizarre but persistent myth claims that wasp spray works as
    a stand-in for pepper spray. Any homeowner who has experienced blowback while
    trying to eradicate a nest will know that the spray is oily and a tad smelly,
    but that’s where the unpleasant effects end (that is, unless you’re a wasp).

    injure an assailant to the point where the attack stops. But a more common function,

    the victim isn’t expecting an attack. But in defensive situations, much like stun
    guns, they require close bodily contact, along with good reflexes, to cause serious
    harm. The consequences of a knife injury aren’t instantaneous, either—so even
    if you mortally wound an armed assailant, you might still get stabbed or shot.
    Because of this, the longer, the better: anything that builds the distance between
    you and the attacker is a plus. In a desperate home defense situation, I’d much
    rather be clumsily swinging a sharp sword than expertly manipulating a paring

    an avid amateur plumber or a big fan of baseball. The problem with blunt instruments
    is mostly that they’re only as menacing as the person wielding them. Another drawback
    is that lacking a sharp blade, a pipe or a bat can be easily grabbed and possibly
    wrestled away. Solutions to this problem have been proposed, such as putting a
    sock or a stocking over the implement—but I’d wager that the real-world efficacy
    of this life hack isn’t what it’s cracked up to be.

    equipped with broadhead arrows or bolts meant for hunting. That said, the main
    problem with these weapons is that they’re incredibly clunky. If you hear knocking
    on the door at 11 PM, it may be weird to greet a neighbor or a police officer
    while holding a cocked crossbow in your hand. Another problem is the abysmal rate

    perceived as far more intimidating than machetes, baseball bats, crossbows, and
    the like. For this reason, they’re remarkably good at resolving conflicts without
    having to fire a single shot. Just as interestingly, when a shot must be fired,
    most assailants are stopped in their tracks even if the injury isn’t immediately
    disabling or life-threatening. The effect may be at least partly psychological.

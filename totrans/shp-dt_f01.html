<blockquote class="Review">
<p class="ReviewQuote">“The title says it all. Data is bound by many complex relationships not easily shown in our two-dimensional, spreadsheet-filled world. <em>The Shape of Data</em> walks you through this richer view and illustrates how to put it into practice.”</p>
<p class="ReviewSource">—Stephanie Thompson, data scientist and speaker</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="Review">
<p class="ReviewQuote">“<em>The Shape of Data</em> is a novel perspective and phenomenal achievement in the application of geometry to the field of machine learning. It is expansive in scope and contains loads of concrete examples and coding tips for practical implementations, as well as extremely lucid, concise writing to unpack the concepts. Even as a more veteran data scientist who has been in the industry for years now, having read this book I’ve come away with a deeper connection to and new understanding of my field.”</p>
<p class="ReviewSource">—Kurt Schuepfer, PhD, McDonald’s Corporation</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="Review">
<p class="ReviewQuote">“<em>The Shape of Data</em> is a great source for the application of topology and geometry in data science. Topology and geometry advance the field of machine learning on unstructured data, and <em>The Shape of Data </em>does a great job introducing new readers to the subject.”</p>
<p class="ReviewSource">—Uchenna “Ike” Chukwu, senior quantum developer</p></blockquote>

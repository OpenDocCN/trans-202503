    a 2D image that displays on a screen. Technically, Fusion 360 is constantly rendering
    your 3D model as you’re working on it. The same is true in other types of software,
    like video games. As you play a video game, the game console or computer takes
    the on-screen 3D assets and renders them for your screen more than 30 times per
    second.'

- en: But when people in the CAD world talk about a “render,” they’re usually referring
    to a single photorealistic image or animated video created specifically for presentation
    purposes, which takes a significant amount of computing power to produce. Fusion
    360 is indeed rendering your model many times per second while you’re working
    on it, but it’s not creating a high-quality image. Computers have only so much
    processing power, and in order for Fusion 360 to display your model at a usable
    frame rate, it has to limit how much time it spends on each frame. That means
    it creates lower-quality renders—good enough for the design phase but not for
    presentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The more time you give Fusion 360 to work on a single frame, the better the
    image it creates. Given enough time, it’s capable of producing images approaching
    photorealism. How long that process takes depends on your computer, the quality
    you want out of the image, and that image’s resolution. A quick-and-rough render
    could take just a few seconds, while a complex, top-quality render could take
    more than an hour.

- en: Even so, Fusion 360’s rendering capabilities are limited. It can certainly produce
    very nice renders that are more than sufficient for something like a Kickstarter
    campaign, but it lacks many of the tools found in software designed specifically
    with rendering in mind. If you need truly photorealistic renders of your model
    in complex scenes, you can always export your model as an STL file and open it
    in more advanced rendering software. [Figure 9-1](ch09.xhtml#ch09fig1) shows a
    photorealistic scene created using 3D modeling and professional rendering software
    intended for creating visuals (as opposed to mechanical designs).

    the **Physical Material** option, as you did with the brass hinge in [Chapter
    8](ch08.xhtml#ch08). The second is to explicitly assign an **Appearance** setting,
    which overrides the appearance of the physical material. The appearance created
    by setting a physical material will apply to the entire model, but you can assign
    appearances to either the whole model or individual faces. You might want to give
    a solid model a two-tone paint job, for example.

    so set its **Physical Material** option to **Stainless Steel, Polished**. The
    model should look a bit nicer now; the color and reflections should look like
    polished stainless steel. But this is still a low-quality render, because Fusion
    360 needs to keep the frame rate high so you can continue to work with the model.
    If the software were trying to produce high-quality renders continuously, it could
    take several seconds—or even minutes—to refresh every time you moved the model,
    rotated it, or modified it.

    look right, because the threaded end is in the air, making the screw appear to

    it’s parallel with the bottom of the View Cube.

    the bottom of the viewport to rotate the threaded end of the screw down. At this
    point, the ground plane will rotate along with the screw, but when you’re done
    rotating the screw, you can fix this by right-clicking the **View Cube**, hovering
    over **Set Current View As**, and selecting **Front** (as shown in [Figure 9-3](ch09.xhtml#ch09fig3)).

    avoiding this setting. Focal Length has the same effect as it does on a real camera:

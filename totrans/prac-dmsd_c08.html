			<p class="ChapterIntro">A comprehensive financial preparedness plan can’t concern itself with only saving money or shuffling assets around; it must also address risks to the supply side of personal wealth. Or, in plain English: no matter what we have in the bank, job security is important too.</p>
			<p>
				At first blush, this assertion may seem overly broad. Many of us imagine that if we can only accumulate enough wealth, we’ll be able to retire early and never worry again about holding a job. In reality, however, few people in their prime reach the point where they no longer need to work another day in their lives, almost no matter how affluent they are. Even most millionaires aren’t so lucky. Assuming all they dream of is the median income for a family with children in the United States, they would need to accumulate at least $3 million in a somewhat risky revenue-generating <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_92" title="92"/>portfolio to be able to permanently hang up their hats.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c08-footnote-1" id="c08-footnoteref-1">*</a></sup> And that’s for a life that’s comfortable, but certainly not glamorous or carefree; if they wish to travel the world or indulge in expensive hobbies, they might need quite a bit more.</p>
			<p>
				Those who still have to get up every morning and go to work would be well served to remember that in the era of rapid technological disruption, fewer and fewer professions guarantee employment for life. In the 1990s, opening a VHS rental place or a music store was a sound business plan, journalism was a revered and well-paying gig, and the photographic film industry was a behemoth that consumed about a third of the global silver supply.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c08-endnote-1" id="c08-noteref-1">1</a></sup> It’s probably safe to assume that the next couple of decades are going to bring seismic shifts to many of today’s cozy professions and industries.</p>
			<p>
				In some cases, workers can be left behind even if their profession is doing fine. In my own field, there’s no shortage of jobs for software developers or computer administrators (now more fashionably called <em>reliability engineers</em>), but few are available to those who don’t keep up with the latest programming languages and framework choices. The jobs to maintain or extend legacy systems written in archaic languages and running on long-obsolete machines can be extremely lucrative, but their supply is drying up year by year.</p>
			<p>
				Whatever the mechanism for the potential future decline in demand for your skills may be, the prescription for tackling this risk can be straightforward: to gradually develop secondary, marketable skills, even if they’re of no immediate relevance to your current job. Most simply, this might involve staying apprised of new developments in your field of expertise and dabbling in the trendy if imperfect next-generation tech. Old-timers have a natural tendency to be suspicious of newfangled inventions and all the half-baked attempts to revolutionize their industries, but when trying to broaden our horizons, it’s good to remember that technologies can succeed even if they’re inferior to the old ways of doing business, and even if they’re <em>clearly</em> derivative of what’s already been discussed in the privately circulated memoir of the Slovenian Philological Society in 1883.</p>
			<p>
				Bootstrapping a brand-new career can also be done safely and gradually. Picking up a sensible hobby is a great way to hone new skills without taking undue risks. Of course, hobbies can be counterproductive money sinks. I had far too many of these, and to weed out the dead ends, I eventually developed a simple test: I would look back at my projects from a year, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_93" title="93"/>two years, or five years ago. Feeling embarrassed and wanting to immediately redo it all would earn the hobby a passing grade; not seeing anything to improve or not knowing how to tackle the flaws would be a sign of a stagnant pursuit.</p>
			<p>As for selecting the right hobby, no list of options is objectively better than the rest. The possibilities are vast, and the right choice will inevitably depend on your own interests and talents, the space you have available, and countless other constraints. Many good, grounded choices with immediately marketable results can be found in the “arts and crafts” category: woodworking, metalworking (including jewelry and knife making), glassblowing, sewing, pottery, and so forth. Scientifically tinged pursuits can be gratifying too and can open doors to interesting job opportunities if you publish your work. Examples include amateur electronics, robotics, and recreational software engineering, to name a few. Creative occupations, such as writing and producing online videos, can quickly supplement income if you find your groove. Hunting for bargain collectibles at garage sales or on Facebook Marketplace can be exhilarating—and pay off handsomely if you develop an eye for the right stuff. Finally, charitable activities, including community education, can offer solid returns in less tangible ways: building meaningful relationships with people who might be looking for dependable employees or business partners down the line.</p>
			<p>Of course, other, more decisive paths can lead to some careers. You might take a plunge to bootstrap a dream business with saved money, or get vocational training and certifications to learn a new profession and build up a résumé. It’s a gutsier move, but it can work well. In such a case, you still have options if the pursuit doesn’t pan out: your old profession becomes the backup plan.</p>

				<p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c08-footnoteref-1" id="c08-footnote-1">*</a></sup> The median income for families with minor children is just short of $90,000 a year; the average return on an index fund is 10 percent. Assuming inflation below 4 percent and perfectly steady market conditions, around $1.5 million is theoretically enough to generate this annual income without depleting the principal in real terms. But in practice, recessions and inflation spikes would throw a wrench in the works; a portfolio of at least twice that size would be needed to have a reasonable chance of long-term success. And if reasonably safe fixed-income securities are preferred to stocks, current conditions in the bond market probably call for $10 million or more. (Of course, the math is better for folks approaching retirement age, as they’re usually operating on shorter time horizons and may be willing to burn their savings along the way.)</p>

    a little hill, she ended up at . . . Recursion Junction!

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    tried a second, and a third, and twenty-seventh time, they always came back to
    Recursion Junction.

    same place. What’s going on?” Laurie wondered.

    a stack of plates falling to the floor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They both jumped in fright, and for a moment Xor accidentally turned the same
    color as Laurie’s shirt. They looked around for the source of the noise but couldn’t
    find it. To their surprise, the next turn put them on a different road.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This road was neat and straight, and it seemed to stretch on forever. Up ahead,
    a man in a Greek helmet was riding on a large Round Green animal with a Shell.
    (Eponymous might have called the creature a *turtle*, though she wouldn’t have
    been quite right.) The two were moving slowly and steadily away.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I thought that was *impossible*,” said the man.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Hello!” the animal said to Laurie. “I am Tortoise, a humble tortoise.” He was
    much too large to be a mere *turtle*. “This is my esteemed companion, Achilles
    the Logician.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “How did you get here, Miss Ipsum?” asked Tortoise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I don’t really know,” Laurie said. “We were following the path to Symbol, but
    I got turned around at Recursion Junction.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    it through, and that’s the important thing. You can help us resolve a question.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Well, I can try,” Laurie said, not sure that she and Tortoise were having the
    same conversation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '“Splendid!” said Tortoise. “The question my dear friend Achilles and I are
    considering is this: how long is an infinite piece of string?”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “An infinite string? Infinite means it’s really, really, really, really, really,
    *really* long. Really,” said Laurie. Really.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    must be borne by the other side.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Friend Tortoise is wise about many things,” said Achilles. “But he is clearly
    wrong this time. He says that an infinite string can be exactly *two inches* long!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “But how can an infinite string be two inches long?” Laurie asked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “His claim is preposterous and indiscrete,” said Achilles. “We are in continuous
    disagreement about it.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    such as yours, Achilles. Your understanding has no limit.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

    question by Experiment.”

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and then measure it. Miss Ipsum can be our impartial judge.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    an impartial judge sounds wonderful, especially when she already agrees with me!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Excellent,” said Tortoise. “Miss Ipsum, imagine you have an infinite number
    of pieces of string. If you laid them all end-to-end, would that be infinitely
    long? Hypothetically?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Yes, it must be,” said Laurie.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I wonder. Suppose we start with a piece of string *one* inch long,” Tortoise
    said. “Then add a second piece of string that is *one-half* inch long. How long
    are they together?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “One and a half inches,” Laurie said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “And that is shorter than two inches?” Tortoise asked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “One-half inch shorter. Unmistakably,” Achilles said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “We all agree thus far,” said Tortoise. “Perhaps we shall converge upon the
    same conclusion.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I doubt that!” said Achilles. Laurie wasn’t sure what Tortoise was getting
    at, but she doubted it, too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Achilles, would you please keep count of our hypothetical string? I want to
    add a third piece *one-quarter* of an inch long,” said Tortoise. “Is our string
    now one and three-quarters inches long?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Achilles retrieved a much-used notebook from under his helmet and scribbled
    some figures. “It seems so,” he said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “With one-quarter inch to spare?” asked Tortoise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Yes,” replied Achilles. “Only one-quarter inch! You are a finger’s width away
    from defeat!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Add an *eighth*-inch piece,” Tortoise said. “Do I still have some space left
    over?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Yes, but I’ll have beaten you soon!” the Greek Logician crowed. “Your string
    is an eighth of an inch away from the limit, and you’ve done only *four* pieces!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Your arithmetic is correct as always, Achilles. But in the interest of science,
    let us continue until the bitter end,” Tortoise said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It won’t be long,” said Achilles. “What is your next move?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I would like to add another piece of string, this time one-sixteenth inch long.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Done!” Achilles scribbled away. “Only one-sixteenth inch left, old friend!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Only that much?” said Tortoise. “Then for the next one, I would like to add
    a piece of string one thirty-second inch long.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “As you wish, poor Tortoise. One thirty-second of an inch added. There is only
    one thirty-second inch remaining, and an infinity of strings to go! There will
    be *plenty* of rope left to trip yourself with!” said Achilles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Please add a sixty-fourth-inch piece of string,” said Tortoise, “then a one-hundred-twenty-eighth-inch
    piece, and a two-hundred-and-fifty-sixth-inch piece, and then a five-hundred-twelfth-inch
    piece, and then—”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Slow down, Tortoise! You are going too fast,” Achilles said. “And those are
    very big—no, very *small* numbers.” He figured and scribbled for a minute. “There
    is only a five-hundred-and-twelfth inch remaining. It’s too bad we’re not splitting
    *hairs*, or you could have gotten a little farther! Do you give up now?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “*Oh.* I see!” exclaimed Laurie. “Achilles, Tortoise is right.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “What? Don’t change your mind *now* when we are so close to victory!” Achilles
    cried.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No, I’m sure Tortoise is right,” said Laurie. “Don’t you see? Every piece he
    adds is *half* as long as the one before. That leaves just enough room left over.
    Even if he adds an infinite number of pieces, the string will *never* reach two
    inches.”

    But just to make sure, I will check the arithmetic *myself*.” He continued to

    big could be so small.”
  prefs: []

    then cut it in two again, and so on, very soon it will be too small to see. But
    there will always be something left over.”

    forever. I’m trying to get to Symbol.”

    said Tortoise. “Your point of view is what’s important. It’s integral.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course! If an infinite string could be less than two inches long, then an
    infinite road could certainly be less than two steps, if you looked at it in the
    right way. Laurie closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She tried to imagine
    an infinite road. That was a little too much to handle, so instead she imagined
    a really, really, really, really long road. Then she imagined folding it in half.
    Then she folded it in half again, and again, and again, and again . . .
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When Laurie opened her eyes, Achilles and Tortoise were gone. The infinite road
    was a tiny, short thing now, hardly more than a stepping stone. She stepped forward
    with her right foot. Then she stepped again with her left foot. In front of her
    was a road sign that read . . .

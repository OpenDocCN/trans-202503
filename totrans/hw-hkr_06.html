<p class="noindent">If the term <em>intellectual property</em> sounds like an oxymoron to you, you’re not alone. If I give you an apple and say, “This is your apple,” what that means is pretty clear. You can do what you want with that apple: you can eat it, sell it, or even use the seeds to plant an apple tree and make more apples, which you can then sell or use to feed your family. But if I hand you a phone and say, “This Apple iPhone is yours,” you own the collection of atoms in your hand, but you have extremely limited rights to the software, patents, and trademarks—the intellectual property—associated with that phone. Unlike with the fruit, you can’t take what’s inside your iPhone and use that knowledge as a seed to make more iPhones.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_120"/>Intellectual property works very differently in China, though. There, you could (and people do) use a phone as the seed for your own original works. Two experiences I had in China opened my eyes to the fact that there isn’t one true path for dealing with intellectual property.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec71"><strong>I BROKE MY PHONE’S SCREEN, AND IT WAS AWESOME</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">My first story begins, as many of my adventures do, with stepping out of a taxi at the Futian border checkpoint going into China. It was May 2014, and I was heading to Shenzhen to hammer out production plans for the Novena open hardware laptop, which I’ll talk more about in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7</a>. As I stepped out of the taxi, my hand caught on my backpack, sending my phone tumbling toward the concrete sidewalk. As the phone smashed into the ground, I heard the dry “thud” of a shattering touchscreen.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There is no better place in the world to break your phone’s screen than the border crossing into Shenzhen. Within an hour, I had a new screen installed by skilled hands in Hua Qiang Bei, for just $25—including parts and labor.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I originally planned to replace the screen myself. The phone still worked, so I hastily visited iFixit for details on how to replace the screen and then booked it to Hua Qiang Bei to purchase replacement parts and tools. The stall I visited quoted me about $120 USD for a new screen, but then the shop owner grabbed my phone out of my hands and launched a built-in self-test program by punching *#0*# into the dialer UI.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">She confirmed that there were no bad pixels on my OLED display and that the digitizer was still functional, just cracked. She then offered to buy my broken OLED and digitizer module, but only if her shop could replace my screen. I said that would be fine as long as I could watch to make sure they didn’t swap out any other parts.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_121"/>Of course, they had no problem with that. In 20 minutes, they took my phone apart, removed the broken module, stripped the adhesive from the phone body, replaced the adhesive, fitted the phone with a “new” (presumably refurbished) module, and put it all back together. The process involved a hair dryer (used as a heat gun), copious amounts of contact cleaner (used to soften the adhesive), and a very long thumbnail (in lieu of a spudger/guitar pick). Unfortunately, I couldn’t take pictures of the process because the device I would have used to do so was in pieces in front of me.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This is the power of recycling and repair. Instead of paying $120 for a screen and throwing away a functional piece of electronics, I just paid the cost to replace the broken glass. I had assumed that the glass on the digitizer was inseparable from the OLED, but apparently those clever folks in Hua Qiang Bei found an efficient way to recycle those parts. After all, the bulk of the module’s cost was in the OLED display. The touchscreen sensor electronics, which were also grafted onto the module, were undamaged by the fall. Why waste perfectly good parts?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">And so my phone had a broken screen for all of an hour, and it was fixed for less than the cost of shipping spare parts to Singapore (my country of residence). Experiences like this get me thinking: why aren’t there services like this in every country? What makes Shenzhen so unique that you can go from a broken screen to a fixed phone in half an hour for much less than the cost of a monthly phone bill? A multitude of factors contribute to this phenomenon, most of which can be traced to a group of people called the <em>shanzhai</em>.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec72"><strong>SHANZHAI AS ENTREPRENEURS</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">The shanzhai of China originally became famous as the producers of knockoffs of products like the iPhone, so they’ve historically been dismissed by the popular press as simply <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_122"/>“copycat barons.” But I think they may have something in common with teams like Hewlett and Packard or Jobs and Wozniak, back when they were working out of garages.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec73"><strong>Who Are the Shanzhai?</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">To understand why I think this, it helps to understand the cultural context of the word <em>shanzhai</em>. Shanzhai (山寨) comes from the Chinese words <em>mountain fortress</em>, but the literal translation is a bit misleading. The English term <em>fortress</em> connotes a large fortified structure or stronghold, perhaps conjuring imagery of castle turrets and moats. On the other hand, its denotation states that it is simply a fortified place, and this is closer to the original Chinese meaning, which refers to something like a cave or guerrilla-style hideout.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In its contemporary context, <em>shanzhai</em> is a historical allusion to the people who lived in such hideouts, like Song Jiang and his 108 bandits, a group of outlaws who lived in the 12th century. A friend of mine described Song Jiang as a sort of Robin Hood meets Che Guevara. He was a rebel and a soldier of fortune, yet selfless and kind to those in need. The tale is still popular today; my father instantly recognized it when I asked him about it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Modern shanzhai innovators are rebellious, individualistic, underground, and self-empowered—just like Song Jiang. They’re rebellious in the sense that they are celebrated for their copycat products. They’re individualistic in the sense that they have a visceral dislike for the large companies. (Many shanzhai are former employees of large companies, both American and Asian, who departed because they were frustrated by the inefficiency of their employers.) They’re underground in the sense that once a shanzhai “goes legit” and does business directly through traditional retail channels, they no longer belong to the fraternity of the shanzhai. They’re self-empowered in the sense that they’re universally <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_123"/>tiny operations, bootstrapped on minimal capital, and their attitude is, “If you can do it, then I can as well.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">An estimated 300 shanzhai organizations were operating in Shenzhen in 2009. Shanzhai shops range from just a couple of folks to a few hundred employees. Some specialize in processes like tooling, PCB design, PCB assembly, or cell phone skinning, while others have broader capabilities.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Since the shanzhai are small, they have to be efficient to maximize output. One shop of under 250 employees can churn out over 200,000 mobile phones per month with a high mix of products, sometimes producing runs as short as a few hundred units. Collectively, shanzhai in the Shenzhen area produced an estimated 20 million phones per month in 2009. That’s an economy approaching a billion dollars a month. Most of those phones sell into third-world and emerging markets like India, Africa, Russia, and southeast Asia.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec74"><strong>More Than Copycats</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Significantly, the shanzhai’s product portfolio includes more than just copycat phones. They innovate and riff on designs to make original products as well. These original phones integrate wacky features like 7.1 stereo sound, dual SIM cards, a functional cigarette holder, a high-zoom lens, or a built-in UV LED for counterfeit money detection.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The shanzhai do to hardware what the web did to mashup compilations. Mobile phones that are also toy Ferraris and watch-phone combos (complete with camera!) are good examples: they don’t copy any single idea, but rather mix IP from multiple sources to create a new heterogeneous composition, such that the original source material is still distinctly recognizable in the final product. Also, like many web mashups, the result might seem nonsensical to a mass market (like the Ferrari phone) but is extremely relevant to a select long-tail market. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_124"/>In a way, some shanzhai products are just ahead of their time; the watch-phones I saw, for example, predated smartwatches by several years.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0124-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>Top: The front and back sides of a phone made to look like a pack of cigarettes.<br/>Bottom left: An Android-based smart watch, which unlike the Apple Watch includes a call-capable phone in the watch. Bottom right: A shanzhai-designed “baby iPhone,” running Android, shown next to an Apple iPhone 6 for scale</em>.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec75"><strong>Community-Enforced IP Rules</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">The shanzhai also employ a concept called the <em>open BOM</em>: when one shanzhai builds something new, they share the bill of materials and other design documents with the others. If the product is based on an existing product, any improvements they make are also shared. These rules are policed by word of mouth within the community to the extent that if someone is found cheating, they are ostracized by the shanzhai ecosystem.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This system is viewed very positively in China. For example, I once heard a local say it was great that the shanzhai could <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_125"/>not only clone an iPhone but also improve upon the original by giving the clone a user-replaceable battery. US law would call this activity illegal and infringing, but given the fecundity of mashup culture on the web, I can’t help but wonder if hardware mashup isn’t a bad thing. There’s definitely a perception in the United States that if it’s strange and it happens in China, it must be bad. This bias casts a long shadow over objective evaluation of a cultural phenomenon that could eventually be very relevant to the United States.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In a sense, the shanzhai are brethren of the classic Western notion of hacker-entrepreneurs, but with a distinctly Chinese twist. My personal favorite shanzhai story is about a chap who owns a three-story house that I am extraordinarily envious of. His bedroom is on top, the middle floor is a complete SMT manufacturing line, and the bottom floor is a retail outlet for the products produced a floor above and designed in his bedroom. Talk about a vertically integrated supply chain! Owning infrastructure like that would certainly disrupt the way I innovate. I could save on production costs, reduce my prototyping time, and aggressively turn inventory around, thereby reducing inventory capital requirements. And if my store were in a high-traffic urban location, I could also cut out the 20 to 50 percent minimum retail margin typically required by US retailers.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I have a theory that when the amount of knowledge and the scale of the markets in Shenzhen reach critical mass, the Chinese will stop being simply workers or copiers. They’ll take control of their destinies and, ultimately, become innovation leaders. These stories about the shanzhai and their mashups are just the tip of an iceberg with the potential to change the way business is done—perhaps not in the United States, but certainly in that massive, untapped market often referred to as “the rest of the world.”</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec76"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_126"/><strong>THE $12 PHONE</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Mashup cell phones demonstrate the shanzhai’s innovation and willingness to experiment. But despite all the bells and whistles, those phones are quite affordable. One question you might ask, then, is how cheaply can you make a phone?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A short jaunt to the northeast corner of the Hua Qiang Bei electronics district brings you to the Mingtong Digital Mall. It’s a four-story maze packed with tiny shops hawking all manner of quirky phones with features useful in economies that lack the infrastructure of consistent electricity or cable networks. For instance, some phones can run for a month thanks to comically oversized batteries. Others have analog TV tuners, integral hand-crank chargers, and multiple user profiles, enabling a family or small village to share a single phone.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">During a visit to the Hua Qiang Bei district in 2013, I paid $12 for a complete phone, featuring quad-band GSM, Bluetooth, MP3 playback, an OLED display, and a keypad for the UI. It’s nothing compared to a smartphone, but it’s useful if you’re going out and worried about your primary phone getting wet or stolen. And for a couple billion people, it may be the only phone they can afford.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Keep in mind this is the contract-free price. In countries that allow carriers to lock phones, such as the United States, phones are often given away or sold to buyers at a fraction of their cost in exchange for a subscription contract often worth several times the phone’s value. The fact that I paid $12 over the counter for a contract-free, nonpromotional, unlocked, new-in-box phone with a charger, protective silicone sleeve, and cable means that the phone’s production cost has to be somewhere below the retail price of $12. Otherwise, the phone’s maker would be losing money. Rumors placed its cost below $10.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_127"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0127-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>My simple but functional $12 phone</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This is a really amazing price point. That’s about the price of a large Domino’s cheese pizza, or a decent glass of wine in an urban US restaurant. It’s even cheap compared to an Arduino Uno. Admittedly, the comparison is a little unfair, but humor me and take a look at the specs for both, shown in <a href="ch04.xhtml#tab01">Table 1</a>.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_128"/>How is it possible that this phone has better specs than an Arduino and costs less than half the price? I don’t have the answers, but I’m trying to learn them. Tearing down the phone yielded a few hints.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec77"><strong>Inside the $12 Phone</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">First, there are no screws in this phone. The whole case snaps together.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0128-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>The back of the phone, after the cover is removed</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_129"/>There are (almost) no connectors on the inside. For shipping and storage, you get to flip a switch to hard-disconnect the battery. As best as I can tell, the battery also has no secondary protection circuit. Still, the phone features accoutrements such as a backlit keypad and decorative lights around the edge.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0129-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>Everything from the display to the battery is soldered directly to the board.</em></p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0129-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>There are little decorative LEDs all over this PCB</em>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_130"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0130-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>The Bluetooth antenna is the small length of wire on the bottom left.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The electronics consist of just two major ICs: the MediaTek MT6250DA and a Vanchip VC5276. The MT6250 is rumored to sell in volume for under $2. I was able to anecdotally confirm the price by buying a couple of pieces on cut tape from a retail broker for about $2.10 each.<a href="footnote.xhtml#fn6" id="fn_6">*</a> That beats the best price I’ve ever been able to get on an ATMega of the types used in an Arduino. With price competition like this, Western firms are suing to protect ground: Vanchip got into a bit of a legal tussle with RF Micro, and MediaTek has been subject to a few lawsuits of its own.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0130-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>Two MediaTek MT6250 ICs</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_131"/>Of course, you can’t just call up MediaTek and buy these chips. It’s extremely difficult to engage with them “going through the front door” to do a design. However, if you know a bit of Chinese and the right websites, you can download schematics, board layouts, and software utilities for something similar to this phone, possibly with some different parts ... for “free.” <em>Free</em> is in quotes because you could obtain the source code but not the unambiguous legal right to use it, as the source code was distributed without the explicit legal consent of the copyright holders. But anyone unconcerned or unfamiliar with such legal frameworks could build versions of this phone, with minimal cash investment. It feels like open source, but it’s not: it’s a different kind of open ecosystem.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec78"><strong>Introducing Gongkai</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Welcome to the Galapagos of Chinese “open” source. I call it <em>gongkai</em> (公开), which is the Chinese transliteration of the English <em>open</em>, as applied to <em>open source</em>. There’s a literal translation for <em>open source</em> into Chinese (<em>kaiyuan</em>), but the only similarity between gongkai practices and Western open source practices is that both allow you to download source code; the legal and cultural frameworks that enable such sharing couldn’t be more different. It’s like convergent evolution, where two species may exhibit similar traits, but the genes and ancestry are totally different.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Gongkai refers to the fact that copyrighted documents, sometimes labeled “confidential” and “proprietary,” are made known to the public and shared overtly, but not necessarily according to the letter of the law. This copying isn’t a one-way flow of value, as it would be in the case of copied movies or music. Rather, these documents are the knowledge base someone would need to build a phone using the copyright owner’s chips, and sharing the documents promotes sales of their chips. There is ultimately a quid pro quo between the copyright holders and the copiers.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_132"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0132-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>Comparing IP models. On the left, the Western “broadcast” model, with a single owner who controls and disseminates IP and is paid by society. On the right, the Chinese “network” model, where IP trades hands like a commodity, and payment is often in-kind or as favors</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This gray relationship between companies and entrepreneurs is just one manifestation of a much broader cultural gap between the East and the West. The West has a “broadcast” view of IP and ownership: good ideas and innovation are credited to a clearly specified set of authors or inventors, and society pays them a royalty for their initiative and good works. China has a “network” view of IP and ownership: one attains the far-reaching sight necessary to create good ideas and innovations by standing on the shoulders of others, and people trade these ideas as favors. In a system with such a loose attitude toward IP, sharing with the network is necessary, as tomorrow your friend could be standing on your shoulders, and you’ll be looking to them for favors.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the West, however, rule of law enables IP to be amassed over a long period of time, creating impenetrable monopoly positions. That’s good for the guys on top but tough for upstarts, causing a situation like the modern Western cell phone market. Companies like Apple and Google build amazing phones of outstanding quality, and startups can only hope to build an “appcessory” for their ecosystem.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_133"/>I’ve reviewed business plans for over 100 hardware startups, and the foundations for most are overpriced chipsets built with antiquated process technologies. I’m no exception to this rule; the Novena uses a Freescale (now NXP after an acquisition) i.MX6 processor, which was neither the cheapest nor the fastest chip on the market when I designed the laptop. But it’s a chip with two crucial qualities: anyone can freely download almost complete documentation for it, and anyone can buy it on Digi-Key.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Scarce documentation and supply for cutting-edge technology force Western hardware entrepreneurs to look primarily at Arduino, Beaglebone, and Raspberry Pi as starting points for their good ideas. Chinese entrepreneurs, on the other hand, churn out new phones at an almost alarming pace.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0133-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>Every object pictured here is a phone.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Phone models change on a seasonal basis. Entrepreneurs experiment all the time, integrating wacky features into phones, such as cigarette lighters, extra-large battery packs (to charge a second phone), huge buttons (for the visually <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_134"/>impaired), call-home buttons only (to give to children for emergencies), watch form factors, and so on. This works because small teams of engineers can obtain complete design packages for working phones—including the case, board, and firmware— allowing them to fork the design and focus only on changing the pieces they really care about.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As a hardware engineer, I want that.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I want to be able to fork existing cell phone designs. I saw the $12 phone, and I, too, wanted to use a 364 MHz 32-bit microcontroller with megabytes of integrated RAM and dozens of peripherals that costs $3 in single quantities. The Arduino Uno’s ATMega microcontroller, a 16 MHz 8-bit microcontroller with a few kilobytes of RAM and a smattering of peripherals, pales in comparison yet costs twice as much, at $6.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec79"><strong>From Gongkai to Open Source</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">So, I decided to take my study of the phone one step further from a teardown, and attempt to make my own version—in the style of the shanzhai, but interpreted through Western eyes. That’s how Sean “xobs” Cross and I started a project we dubbed <em>Fernvale</em>. Sean has been my adventure partner on dozens of projects since we first met at Chumby, where I recognized his talent as a firmware engineer when he showed me how he ported Quake to chumby in his spare time. Sean has always marched to the beat of his own drum. Born in Germany to American parents, he studied cognitive science in college, and prior to working at Chumby, he spent six months wandering New Zealand and Australia, searching for adventure and work. At Chumby, he was easy to spot, thanks to his ponytail and kilt (actually, a Utilikilt).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After Chumby went out of business, Sean and I found ourselves washed up on the shores of Singapore, where I started a boutique hardware consulting firm called Sutajio Ko-Usagi, which is <em>bunniestudios</em> translated to Japanese and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_135"/>then romanized into English characters. Sean’s virtuoso coding abilities have been an excellent complement to my hardware design skills, and since then, we’ve completed several significant open source projects.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We figured at first we should at least try to go “through the front door” and inquire directly with the chipmakers about what it might take to get a proper Western-licensed embedded development kit (EDK) for the chips used in these shanzhai phones. Our inquiries were met with a cold shoulder. I was told the volumes for our little experiment were too small, or we’d have to enter minimum purchase agreements backed by a prohibitive cash deposit in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Even for people who jump through such hoops, these EDKs don’t include all the reference material the Chinese get to play with. The datasheets are incomplete, and you’re forced to use the companies’ proprietary OS ports. It feels like a case of the nice guys finishing last. Could we find a way to get ahead yet still play nice?</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec80"><strong>Engineers Have Rights, Too</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Thus, Fernvale had two halves: the technical task of reverse engineering and re-engineering the phone and the legal task of creating a general methodology for absorbing gongkai IP into the Western ecosystem. I’ll recount the technical task in <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9</a> and focus on the legal task for the remainder of this chapter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After some research into the legal frameworks and challenges, I believed I’d found a path to repatriate some of the IP from gongkai into proper open source. I must, however, give a disclaimer: I’m not a lawyer. I’ll tell you my beliefs, but don’t construe them as legal advice.<a href="footnote.xhtml#fn7" id="fn_7">*</a></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_136"/>My basic idea with Fernvale was to exercise the right to reverse engineer in a careful, educated fashion to increase the likelihood that, if push came to shove, the courts would agree with my actions. But I also feel that shying away from reverse engineering simply because it’s controversial is a slippery slope: to have your rights, you must exercise them. If women didn’t vote and black people sat in the back of the bus because they were afraid of controversy, the United States would still be segregated and without universal suffrage. Although reverse engineering is a trivial issue compared to racial equality and universal suffrage, the precedent is clear: in order to have rights, you must be bold enough to stand up and assert them.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec81">DEALING WITH PATENTS AND OTHER LAWS</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Open source has two broad categories of IP issues to deal with: patents and copyrights. Patents present complex issues, and it seems the most practical approach is to essentially punt on the issue. For instance, nobody, as far as I know, checks their Linux commits for patent infringement before upstreaming them, and in fact, many corporations have similar policies at the engineering level.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Why? Determining which patents apply and if a product infringes takes a huge amount of resources. Even after expending those resources, you can’t be 100 percent sure. Further, becoming very familiar with the body of patents amplifies the possibility that any infringement is willful, thus tripling damages. Finally, it’s not even clear where the liability for infringement lies, particularly in an open source context.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Thus, Sean and I did our best not to infringe with Fernvale, but we couldn’t be 100 percent sure that no one would allege infringement. However, we did apply a license to our work that includes a “poison pill” clause for patent holders who <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_137"/>might attempt to litigate. Poison pills make the entire body of open source work unavailable to any party who files a lawsuit alleging infringement of any part against any entity.<a href="footnote.xhtml#fn8" id="fn_8">*</a></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For copyrights, the issue is also extremely complex. The Coders’ Rights Project from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has a Reverse Engineering FAQ<sup><a href="footnote.xhtml#fn9" id="fn_9">†</a></sup> that’s a good read if you really want to dig into the issues. To sum it up, courts have found that reverse engineering to understand the ideas embedded in code and to achieve interoperability is fair use. As a result, anyone likely has the right to study the gongkai-style IP, understand it, produce a new work, and apply a Western-style Open IP license to it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">However, before I could attack the copyright issues for Fernvale, I had to make sure we wouldn’t bump into other laws that could impede our fair use rights. First, there’s the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The DMCA makes circumventing any encryption designed to enforce a copyright basically illegal, with only a few poorly tested exemptions allowed. Since none of the files or binaries Sean and I downloaded were encrypted or had access controlled by any technological measure, we didn’t have to do any circumvention. No circumvention, no DMCA problem.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">All the files we obtained came from searches linking to public servers, so there would be no Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) problems. None of the devices we used in the work came with shrink-wraps, click-throughs, or other end-user license agreements (EULAs), terms of use, or other agreements that could waive our rights.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec82"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_138"/>DEALING WITH COPYRIGHTS</h5>&#13;
<p class="indent">With the DMCA, CFAA, and EULA concerns set aside, we were finally able to address the core issue: what to do about copyrights.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentb">The cornerstone of our methodology hinged on decisions rendered on several occasions by courts stating that facts are not copyrightable. For example, Justice O’Connor wrote the following in <em>Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc.</em> (449 U.S. 340, 345, 349 (1991):<a href="footnote.xhtml#fn10" id="fn_10">*</a></p>&#13;
<p class="termp">Common sense tells us that 100 uncopyrightable facts do not magically change their status when gathered together in one place. ... The key to resolving the tension lies in understanding why facts are not copyrightable: The sine qua non of copyright is originality.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentb">And:</p>&#13;
<p class="termp">Notwithstanding a valid copyright, a subsequent compiler remains free to use the facts contained in another’s publication to aid in preparing a competing work, so long as the competing work does not feature the same selection and arrangement.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentd">Based on this opinion, anyone has the right to extract facts from proprietary documentation and carefully re-express those facts in their own selection and arrangement. Just as the facts that “John Doe’s phone number is 555-1212” and “John Doe’s address is 10 Main St.” are not copyrightable, facts such as “The interrupt controller’s base address is 0xA0060000” and “Bit 1 controls status reporting of the LCD” aren’t copyrightable, either. Sean and I extracted such facts from datasheets and re-expressed them in our own header files where, as the legal owners of newly created expressive speech, we applied a proper open source license of our choice.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec83">MAKING A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">But the situation was further complicated by hardware blocks we had absolutely no documentation for. In some cases, we couldn’t even learn what a block’s registers meant or how the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_139"/>blocks functioned from a datasheet. For these blocks, we isolated and extracted the code responsible for initializing their state. We then reduced this code into a list of address and data pairs, and expressed it in a custom scripting language we called <em>scriptic</em>. We invented our own language to avoid subconscious plagiarism—it’s too easy to read one piece of code and, from memory, code something almost exactly the same. By transforming the code into a new language, we were forced to consider the facts presented and express them in an original arrangement.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Scriptic is basically a set of assembler macros, and the syntax is very simple. Here is an example of a scriptic script:</p>&#13;
<pre>#include "scriptic.h"<br/>#include "fernvale-pll.h"<br/><br/>sc_new "set_plls", 1, 0, 0<br/><br/>  sc_write16 0, 0, PLL_CTRL_CON2<br/>  sc_write16 0, 0, PLL_CTRL_CON3<br/>  sc_write16 0, 0, PLL_CTRL_CON0<br/>  sc_usleep 1<br/><br/>  sc_write16 1, 1, PLL_CTRL_UPLL_CON0<br/>  sc_write16 0x1840, 0, PLL_CTRL_EPLL_CON0<br/>  sc_write16 0x100, 0x100, PLL_CTRL_EPLL_CON1<br/>  sc_write16 1, 0, PLL_CTRL_MDDS_CON0<br/>  sc_write16 1, 1, PLL_CTRL_MPLL_CON0<br/>  sc_usleep 1<br/><br/>  sc_write16 1, 0, PLL_CTRL_EDDS_CON0<br/>  sc_write16 1, 1, PLL_CTRL_EPLL_CON0<br/>  sc_usleep 1<br/><br/>  sc_write16 0x4000, 0x4000, PLL_CTRL_CLK_CONDB<br/>  sc_usleep 1<br/><br/>  sc_write32 0x8048, 0, PLL_CTRL_CLK_CONDC<br/>  /* Run the SPI clock at 104 MHz */<br/>  sc_write32 0xd002, 0, PLL_CTRL_CLK_CONDH<br/>  sc_write32 0xb6a0, 0, PLL_CTRL_CLK_CONDC<br/>  sc_end</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_140"/>This script initializes the Phase Locked Loop (PLL, a circuit for generating clock waveforms) on the target chip for Fernvale, the MediaTek MT6260. To contrast, here are the first few lines of the code snippet from which that scriptic code was derived:</p>&#13;
<pre>// enable HW mode TOPSM control and clock CG of PLL control<br/><br/>*PLL_PLL_CON2 = 0x0000; // 0xA0170048, bit 12, 10 and 8 set to 0<br/>                        // to enable TOPSM control<br/>                        // bit 4, 2 and 0 set to 0 to enable<br/>                        // clock CG of PLL control<br/>*PLL_PLL_CON3 = 0x0000; // 0xA017004C, bit 12 set to 0 to enable<br/>                        // TOPSM control<br/><br/>// enable delay control<br/>*PLL_PLLTD_CON0= 0x0000; // 0x A0170700, bit 0 set to 0 to<br/>                         // enable delay control<br/><br/>// wait for 3us for TOPSM and delay (HW) control signal stable<br/>for(i = 0 ; i &lt; loop_1us*3 ; i++);<br/><br/>// enable and reset UPLL<br/>reg_val = *PLL_UPLL_CON0;<br/>reg_val |= 0x0001;<br/>*PLL_UPLL_CON0 = reg_val; // 0xA0170140, bit 0 set to 1 to<br/>                          // enable UPLL and<br/>                          // generate reset of UPLL</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">The original code actually goes on for pages and pages, and even this snippet is surrounded by conditional statements, which we culled as they were irrelevant to initializing the PLL correctly.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Knowledge of our rights, a pool of documentation to extract facts from, and scriptic were tools in our armory. With them, Sean and I derived sufficient functionality for our Fernvale project to eventually boot a small, BSD-licensed, real-time operating system (RTOS) known as NuttX, running on our own custom hardware. I’ll go more into the gory details of how we did that in <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9</a>.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec84"><strong><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_141"/>CLOSING THOUGHTS</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Rights atrophy and get squeezed out by competing interests if they aren’t vigorously exercised. Sean and I did Fernvale because we think it’s imperative to exercise our fair use rights to reverse engineer and create interoperable, open source solutions. For decades, engineers have sat on the sidelines and seen ever more expansive patent and copyright laws shrink their latitude to learn freely and to innovate. I’m sad that the formative tinkering I did as a child is no longer a legal option for the next generation of engineers.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The rise of the shanzhai and their amazing capabilities is a wake-up call. I see it as evidence that a permissive IP environment spurs innovation, especially at the grassroots level. If more engineers learn their fair use rights and exercise them vigorously and deliberately, perhaps this can catalyze a larger and much-needed reform of the patent and copyright system. Our Fernvale project is hopefully just a signpost pointing the way for much bigger efforts to bridge the gap between the gongkai and open source communities.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Being able to cherry-pick the positive aspects of gongkai into the Western IP ecosystem is an important tool. Rule of law has its place, and an overly permissive system has its own problems. The next chapter explores some of the negative consequences of an overly permissive IP ecosystem: fake and counterfeit goods.</p>&#13;

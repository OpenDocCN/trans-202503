    golfing, a “sport” that involves writing the shortest Perl program to get a task

    the program (specified by `-e`) that reads each line of input into the `$_` variable,
    executes the program, and then prints the contents of the `$_` variable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This one-liner simply modifies `$_` by prepending the `$.` variable to it. The
    special variable `$.` contains the current line number of the input. The result
    is that each line has its line number prepended.

    if the condition is true. In this case, the condition is the regular expression
    `/./`, which matches all characters other than newline (that is, it matches a
    non-empty line). The action `$_ = ++$x." $_"` prepends the variable `$x` incremented
    by one to the current line. Because you’re not using the `strict` pragma, `$x`
    is created automatically the first time it’s incremented.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to that line. Nothing is modified at the empty lines, and they are printed as

    Once it loops over the input, the special variable `$.` contains the number of
    lines in the input, and the `END` block prints this variable. The `-l` parameter

    the list context, which makes the diamond operator read the whole file as a list
    of lines. Next, you assign this list to `$n`. Because `$n` is scalar, this list
    assignment is evaluated in the scalar context.

    in the input, that is, the number of lines in the file. The `print` statement
    prints this number. The `-l` argument ensures a newline is added after printing
    this number.

    is a regular expression that matches at least one character, so the input is filtered

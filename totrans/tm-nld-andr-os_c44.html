<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">O</span>ne of the things that defines the Android ecosystem nowadays is an almost infinite variety of devices. Not only are there many different models of phones made by many different manufacturers, but there are also tablets. And cameras. And TVs. And autos. And watches. And IoT devices. And entertainment screens on airplanes.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c44-footnote-1" id="c44-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c44-0001">Before 1.0: Sooner, Dream (HTC G1), and More</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The very early plans included four phones. As Swetland recalled, “The four devices that were under discussion in June 2006 were Sooner (HTC wedge), Later (LG wedge), Dream (HTC G1), and Grail (a Motorola device that would slide one way for qwerty and the other way for keypad). Grail (or some variant <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_336" title="336"/>of it) would keep popping up and going away over the years.” But the plan eventually settled into just Sooner and Dream, whose respective demise and development is discussed in earlier chapters.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c44-0002">Sapphire (HTC Magic)</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Android’s second flagship device, code-named Sapphire, was based on the HTC Magic. It came out in the Spring of 2009 with the Android 1.5 Cupcake release. The actual hardware specs were similar to those in the original G1, although the Magic had more memory. But the biggest change was the keyboard: Android was finally comfortable with going fully touchscreen and dropped the hardware keyboard that was on the earlier G1 device. The Magic also supported multi-touch<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c44-footnote-2" id="c44-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup> for the first time on Android.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c44-0003">Motorola Droid</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The Droid phone was so important to early Android that it has its very own chapter (<span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 45">Chapter 45</span>, “Droid Did”). You can go read that now if you’d like. I’ll wait.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c44-0004">Passion and Nexus</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">In parallel with the Droid phone, the team was working on another device code-named Passion. It was released in early 2010 as the Nexus One.</p>

</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_337" title="337"/>Passion was one of the “Google Experience” phones. The Google Experience process has gone through many names and types of collaboration over the years. At the time of Nexus One, the collaboration with HTC was given the brand “With Google.” The slogan was invented in engineering. Marketing had come up with the slogan, “It’s got Google.” But Rebecca, on the systems team, complained to Andy Rubin: “It’s not even grammatical! What about ‘With Google’ instead?” Andy said “Okay!” The co-branding slogan was born.</p>
<p>Passion had a large (for that time) screen and hand-fitting curves. But the unique thing about Passion wasn’t the hardware or software; it was the sales model that Android attempted. In the US, the way that everyone bought their phone back then (and now, for the most part) was through a contract with their carrier. Rather than buying a device on its own and then paying a carrier to be on their network, you went to a T-Mobile store (for example) and bought one of the phones they offered. Phones were sold at a substantial discount, along with a contractual lock-in for some period of time. That’s just how the phone market worked.</p>
<p>But Android leadership had this idea that people should have options. What if they chose their phone independent of the carrier, paying a carrier just to be connected to their network? They would be free of contractual obligations, and users would have more choice because people wouldn’t have to pick from just those devices that happened to be on the carrier store’s shelves.</p>
<p>Google didn’t have store fronts, so they offered the Nexus One for sale online. And they waited. But it turns out that people didn’t really understand this model of buying phones and weren’t in a rush to figure it out. Moreover, if there were problems with a phone they bought off the website, there wasn’t a customer service number to call, and there also wasn’t a store that they could return it to or get help from.</p>
<p>Android eventually gave up on this idea, and the Nexus One was offered by carriers. It never sold as much as Google had hoped and was far outsold by the Motorola Droid.</p>
<p>The Nexus One was the first of many phones in the Nexus series. Nexus phones were devices that the Android team would work on in conjunction with manufacturers to create an overall Android phone experience. The team couldn’t control what other manufacturers would produce and sell, either in the hardware or the software and apps that might be layered on top of Android. By shipping their own phones, Android could ensure that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_338" title="338"/>those devices had exactly the hardware they wanted (within the range of what hardware partners could offer, at least) and exactly the software they wanted.</p>
<p>The other, and perhaps main, reason for the Nexus program was to produce a “reference device.” Nexus phones showed the world (and partners) what Android was capable of in that release. But the team also ensured that the platform reliably supported new capabilities, which might have been harder if the hardware were being developed separately from the software. For many years and releases, a new Nexus phone launched in conjunction with each software release, showing off the latest hardware advancements along with new capabilities of Android.</p>
<p>Throughout Android’s history, one of the most important dynamics about Nexus, and other devices that Google helped launch, was that they were made by different manufacturers. This was very intentional, as a way to get the entire partner community invested in Android. Early devices from Google included phones by HTC, Motorola, LG, and Samsung.</p>
<p>Charles Mendis said, “A lot of credit to Andy and biz dev. We didn’t just partner with one; we’d switch between them. We managed to get some of the biggest players in the hardware space invested in Android, where it became <em>their</em> platform, and now all this phone hardware is done by them. We made them feel like everybody else owned Android, too; Android wasn’t owned by Google.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c44-footnote-3" id="c44-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup> I think that really helped the success of it.”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c44-0005">Brian Jones and Device Distribution</h2>
<blockquote class="Epigraph" epub:type="epigraph">
<p class="Epigraph">I was the [equipment] hook-up guy.</p>
<p class="EpigraphSource">—Brian Jones</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="BodyFirst">In every tech company, there’s the person you have to know to get the best equipment to get your job done. That person is the glue between all of the people on the inside and all of the things that those people need.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_339" title="339"/>On the Android team, that person was Brian Jones (known to everyone as “bjones”).</p>
<p>Brian has always been a tinkerer. In early elementary school, he wanted to know how telephones worked, so his teacher created a class activity and brought in her own telephone from home. “I took it apart all the way down to the wax-enclosed transformers. There was no hope of me putting this back together. It was waxy. It made a big mess in the cafeteria. I had never actually done this before. I got in a lot of trouble because she expected to be able to take her telephone home and use it that night, and that was not going to happen.”</p>
<p>Brian’s route to the Android team was atypical, starting with his college degree in Classics. When he moved to the Bay Area and needed employment, he got a job as a receptionist for building 44, where the Android team worked. He got to know many of the people on the team, including Andy’s admin, Tracey Cole. Brian’s advice: “Befriend the admins. They’re the second—if not first—most important people you can possibly gain the trust of in life.”</p>
<p>In the Spring of 2007, Tracey went out on leave. Andy needed someone to do her job while she was out. “Tracey was like, ‘I don’t want to have to go find a temp. Brian is already somebody we trust. He’s the only one I want to leave this to.’ So I was Andy’s admin for three to four months.”</p>

</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_340" title="340"/>When Tracey returned, Brian took on a new role on the team: he became the dogfood manager, in charge of Android device distribution. When phones came in from the manufacturer, Brian would laser-etch them with unique IDs. “That was my job, to etch every phone as quickly as I possibly could, for hundreds of people who needed to get them. If there were ever leaks, we could trace them back. But it was also good for fleet management.”</p>
<p>Laser etching wasn’t limited to test devices. “Mugs. Glasses. We tried ham. Turkey. We lit several fires. I learned a lot about lasers in that time of my life.”</p>
<p>Brian enjoyed the random hardware he needed to do the job. “There were lasers. There were UV printers. I remember getting sunburned from looking at the custom-backed G1, watching those things get printed, because every back would change. It would warp a little bit differently, and if they warped too much, you had to change the printer setup. I got sunburned. Inside. In a windowless section of the building.”</p>

<figcaption><p>Brian Jones’s test device, a pre-release G1, which he used to calibrate the machine before etching a new set of devices.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One of the reasons that Brian ran device distribution was that his priority was always helping the product. He didn’t play corporate games. “It landed on my shoulders to be the guy who decided who got what. One of the things I think I’m good at is not being swayed by people’s titles or salesmanship or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_341" title="341"/>personalities. If somebody comes and says, ‘I need this thing,’ my first question is, ‘Why do you need it and what’s the impact if you don’t get it?’</p>
<p>“If you’re an executive, some of the impact is: we can’t make product decisions. But gauging how those executives actually factor in is important. In the early days, if you were a VP or SVP in Sales or Ads, that had nothing to do with Android, I didn’t care who you were. That didn’t have anything to do with my product line. You were treated no differently than somebody off the street.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a problem telling people to f-off, regardless of who you are. If somebody on the team that I knew worked on it, like Mike Cleron, says, ‘Our team is short, we need some devices, what can you do for us?’ Whatever you want. You guys make the product happen, you’re going to get whatever you want, no red tape. I know that you are important, you’re a core component to this, and you’re not puffing up your request.”</p>
<p>Eventually, Brian became a focal point for everyone who needed anything from Android. When devices came in, there would be a constant line of people at his desk. There would also be a constant stream of people coming into the building, looking for him and his devices, and asking people in the building where they could find him. Bruce Gay, who sat next to Brian, hung a sign on his desk that said “Not Bjones.” Just to make things clear.</p>

Sometimes you can swipe up from the bottom of the screen to see a familiar navigation bar. Then you can swipe away the video app and be left at the home screen of Android. Which doesn’t buy you much, since the airline doesn’t have any other app installed besides the entertainment one you just killed. 
Okay, maybe it’s not that fun. But on a 12-hour flight when you’re tired of all of the movie options, it’s something to do.</p></aside>

But by releasing it to open source, they created a system where manufacturers could download it, change it, and then own their own implementation, independent of Google. It is this shared ownership across the entire ecosystem of Android devices to which Charles is referring.</p></aside>

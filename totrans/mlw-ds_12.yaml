    life and career as a malware data scientist or a security data scientist in general.
    Although this is a nontechnical chapter, it’s just as important as the technical
    chapters in this book, if not more important. This is because becoming a successful
    security data scientist involves much more than simply understanding the subject
    matter.

    security data scientists. You’ll get a glimpse of what day-to-day life looks like
    as a security data scientist and what it takes to become an effective data scientist.
    We also share tips on how to approach data science problems and how to stay resilient
    in the face of inevitable challenges.

    a security data scientist. Whereas many data scientists receive formal training
    through graduate school, many others are self-taught. For example, I grew up in
    the 1990s computer hacking scene, where I learned to program in C and assembly
    and to write black-hat hacking tools. Later, I got a bachelor’s degree and then
    a master’s degree in the humanities before re-entering the tech world as a security
    software developer. Along the way, I taught myself data visualization and machine
    learning at night, finally moving into a formal security data science role at
    Sophos, a security research and development company. Hillary Sanders, my co-author
    on this book, studied statistics and economics in college, worked as a data scientist
    for a time, and later found work at a security company as a data scientist, picking
    up her security knowledge on the job.

    in a wide range of disciplines: psychology, data science, mathematics, biochemistry,
    statistics, and computer science. Although security data science is biased toward
    those with formal training in quantitative methods in science, it includes folks
    with varied backgrounds in these fields. And although scientific and quantitative
    training is helpful for learning security data science, my own experience suggests
    that it’s also possible to enter and excel in our field with a nontraditional
    background, as long as you’re willing to teach yourself.'

    learn new things. This is because practical knowledge is just as important as
    theoretical knowledge in our field, and you pick up practical knowledge through
    *doing*, not through school work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being willing to learn new things is also important because machine learning,
    network analysis, and data visualization are constantly changing, so what you
    learn in school quickly goes out of date. For example, deep learning has only
    taken off as a trend in the years since around 2012, and has developed rapidly
    since, so almost everyone in data science who graduated before then has had to
    teach themselves these powerful ideas. This is good news for those seeking to
    enter security data science professionally. Since those already in the field have
    to constantly teach themselves new skills, you can get a foot in the door by already
    knowing those skills.

    book to hard security problems. But application of these skills tends to be embedded
    within a larger workflow that involves other skills as well. [Figure 12-1](ch12.xhtml#ch12fig1)
    illustrates a typical workflow of a security data scientist, based on our experience
    and that of our colleagues at other companies and organizations.

- en: As [Figure 12-1](ch12.xhtml#ch12fig1) shows, the security data science workflow
    involves an interplay between five areas of work. The first area, *problem identification*,
    involves identifying security problems where data science can help. For example,
    we may hypothesize that identifying spear-phishing emails can be solved using
    data science methods, or that identifying the particular method used to obfuscate
    known malware is a problem worth investigating.

- en: At this stage, any assumption that a given problem may be solvable with data
    science is just a hypothesis. When you have a hammer (data science), every problem
    can look like a nail (a machine learning, data visualization, or network analysis
    problem). We have to reflect on whether these problems are *truly* best addressed
    using data science methods, keeping in mind that it will take building a prototype
    data science solution and then testing this solution to better understand if data
    science actually provides the *best* solution.

- en: When you’re working within an organization, identifying a good problem almost
    always involves interacting with stakeholders who are not themselves data scientists.
    For example, within our company, we often interface with product managers, executives,
    software developers, and salespeople who think that data science is like a magic
    wand that can solve any problem, or that data science is akin to “artificial intelligence”
    and therefore has some magical ability to achieve unrealistic results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key thing to remember when dealing with such stakeholders is to be honest
    about the capabilities and limitations of data science–based approaches, and to
    maintain a shrewd, measured attitude so that you don’t go chasing the wrong problems.
    You should discard problems for which there is no data to drive data science algorithms
    or no way to evaluate whether your data science approaches are actually working,
    as well as problems you can clearly solve better through more manual methods.

    your next task is to identify data feeds you can use to help solve it using the
    data science techniques explained in this book. This is shown in step 2 of [Figure
    12-1](ch12.xhtml#ch12fig1). At the end of the day, if you don’t have data feeds
    that you can use to train machine learning models, feed visualizations, or drive
    network analysis that solves your chosen security problem, data science is probably
    not going to help you.

    to build a data science–based solution to the problem, it’s time to begin building
    your solution. This actually happens in an iterative loop between steps 3 and
    4 of [Figure 12-1](ch12.xhtml#ch12fig1): you build something, evaluate it, improve
    it, reevaluate it, and so on.'

    to go back and integrate new data feeds as they become available, try out new
    data science methods, and redeploy new versions of your system.

    problem. It’s important to keep your mind open to your data proving your preconceived
    notions wrong. If you don’t, you’ll end up missing important learnings from your
    data, and even reading too much into random noise to convince yourself of a false
    theory. Fortunately, the more security data science you do, the more open-minded
    you’ll be about “learning” from your data, and the more okay you’ll be with how
    little you know and how much you have to learn from each new problem. In time,
    you’ll come to both enjoy and expect surprises from your data.

    in that they require exploring data to find patterns, outliers, and trends, which
    we then leverage to build our systems. Identifying these dynamics is not easy:
    it often requires running hundreds of experiments or analyses to get a sense of
    the overall shape of your data and the stories hidden inside. Some people have
    a natural drive to run shrewdly designed experiments and to dig deeper into their
    data, almost addictively, whereas others don’t. The former is the type of person
    who tends to succeed at data science. Curiosity is therefore a *requirement* in
    this field because it’s what differentiates our ability to arrive at a deep understanding
    of our data versus a shallow one. The more you can cultivate an attitude of curiosity
    when building models and visualizations of your data, the more useful your systems
    will be.'

    of you, particularly on machine learning projects. This is a good sign. For example,
    when I’m heavily involved in a machine learning project, I have multiple experiments
    running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This means that I might wake up multiple
    times a night to check on the status of the experiments, and often need to fix
    bugs and restart experiments at 3:00 in the morning. I tend to check in on my
    experiments before going to bed every night and multiple times throughout the
    weekend.

    science project. For example, perhaps you set up your evaluation incorrectly,
    such that it appears your system’s accuracy is much better than it actually is.
    Evaluating your system on data that’s too similar to your training data or too
    dissimilar from real-world data is a common pitfall. You also might have inadvertently
    cherry-picked examples from your network visualization that *you* thought were
    useful but most users don’t find much value in. Or perhaps you worked so hard
    on your approach that you convinced yourself that the evaluation statistics are
    good, when in fact they’re not good enough to make your system useful in your
    real world. It’s important to maintain a healthy level of skepticism of your results,
    lest you find yourself in an embarrassing situation someday.

    with Wikipedia articles on the data science algorithms you want to learn more
    about. Wikipedia is a surprisingly accessible and authoritative resource when
    it comes to data science, and it’s free. For those who want to go deeper, especially
    in machine learning, we recommend picking up books on linear algebra, probability
    theory, statistics, graph analytics, and multivariable calculus, or taking free
    online courses. Learning these fundamentals will pay dividends for the rest of
    your data science career, because they are the foundation on which our field rests.
    Beyond focusing on these fundamentals, we also recommend taking courses on or
    reading more “applied” books about Python, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`,
    `Keras`, and any other tools covered in this book that are used heavily in the
    data science community.

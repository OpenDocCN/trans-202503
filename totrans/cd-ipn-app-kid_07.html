<h2 class="h2a">STORING COLLECTIONS IN DICTIONARIES AND ARRAYS</h2>
<div class="image1"><img src="Image00001.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">In previous chapters, you learned that you can store a single piece of information in a variable or constant. But what if you want to store a collection of things, like the names of all the places you’ve visited or all the books that you’ve read? In this chapter, we’ll introduce you to arrays and dictionaries. They’re both used to store collections of values. Using arrays and dictionaries, you can work with a lot of data at once and make your programs more powerful!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec1">
<strong>KEEPING THINGS IN ORDER WITH ARRAYS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">An <em>array</em>
 is a list of items of the same data type stored in order, kind of like a numbered grocery list. Items in an array are stored by their <em>index</em>
 , a number based on where the item is positioned in the array.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_68"></span>
 When you write a grocery list, you usually start with the number 1, but in computer programming, an index starts at 0, not 1. So the first item in an array is always at index 0, the second item is at index 1, the third item is at index 2, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s create an array. If you already know what you’re going to put into your array, you can create it and <em>initialize</em>
 it with those values. To initialize something in Swift is to give it some initial value so you can use it in your program. Let’s say that you want to store a list of all of the national parks that you’ve visited. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00114.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code creates an array variable called <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 and initializes it with the names of three national parks. Because we initialized this array to hold strings, you’ll only be able to put strings in it.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a href="text00016.html#ch06fig1">Figure 6-1</a>
 shows how you can imagine your array. It’s like a row of boxes containing the three names of national parks at indices 0, 1, and 2. Remember that the indices of an array always start at 0!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00115.jpg" alt="Image" />

 array</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec1">
<strong>USING MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array is a variable because we created it with the <span class="code">var</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . An array stored in a variable is called a <em>mutable</em>
 array. This means that you can change it by adding items, removing items, or swapping items in and out.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also create an <em>immutable</em>
 array. An immutable array is created with the keyword <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 . Similar to a constant, once an immutable array is created, nothing in it can be changed.</p>
<p class="indent">So when should you use a mutable array or an immutable array? It’s best to use <span class="code">let</span>
 if you know your collection will never change, like if you’re storing the colors of the rainbow. You should use <span class="code">var</span>
 if you need to change your collection, like if you’re storing an array of your favorite T-shirts, which might change depending on what’s in style!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00116.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2"><span id="page_69"></span>
 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_70"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig3"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00136.jpg" alt="Image" />

 <em>Figure 6-4: Output of the example <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>

<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<h2 class="h2a">STORING COLLECTIONS IN DICTIONARIES AND ARRAYS</h2>
<div class="image1"><img src="Image00001.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">In previous chapters, you learned that you can store a single piece of information in a variable or constant. But what if you want to store a collection of things, like the names of all the places you’ve visited or all the books that you’ve read? In this chapter, we’ll introduce you to arrays and dictionaries. They’re both used to store collections of values. Using arrays and dictionaries, you can work with a lot of data at once and make your programs more powerful!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec1">
<strong>KEEPING THINGS IN ORDER WITH ARRAYS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">An <em>array</em>
 is a list of items of the same data type stored in order, kind of like a numbered grocery list. Items in an array are stored by their <em>index</em>
 , a number based on where the item is positioned in the array.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_68"></span>
 When you write a grocery list, you usually start with the number 1, but in computer programming, an index starts at 0, not 1. So the first item in an array is always at index 0, the second item is at index 1, the third item is at index 2, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s create an array. If you already know what you’re going to put into your array, you can create it and <em>initialize</em>
 it with those values. To initialize something in Swift is to give it some initial value so you can use it in your program. Let’s say that you want to store a list of all of the national parks that you’ve visited. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00114.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code creates an array variable called <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 and initializes it with the names of three national parks. Because we initialized this array to hold strings, you’ll only be able to put strings in it.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a href="text00016.html#ch06fig1">Figure 6-1</a>
 shows how you can imagine your array. It’s like a row of boxes containing the three names of national parks at indices 0, 1, and 2. Remember that the indices of an array always start at 0!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00115.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-1: The <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec1">
<strong>USING MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array is a variable because we created it with the <span class="code">var</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . An array stored in a variable is called a <em>mutable</em>
 array. This means that you can change it by adding items, removing items, or swapping items in and out.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also create an <em>immutable</em>
 array. An immutable array is created with the keyword <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 . Similar to a constant, once an immutable array is created, nothing in it can be changed.</p>
<p class="indent">So when should you use a mutable array or an immutable array? It’s best to use <span class="code">let</span>
 if you know your collection will never change, like if you’re storing the colors of the rainbow. You should use <span class="code">var</span>
 if you need to change your collection, like if you’re storing an array of your favorite T-shirts, which might change depending on what’s in style!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00116.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2"><span id="page_69"></span>
 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_70"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image1"><img src="Image00001.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">In previous chapters, you learned that you can store a single piece of information in a variable or constant. But what if you want to store a collection of things, like the names of all the places you’ve visited or all the books that you’ve read? In this chapter, we’ll introduce you to arrays and dictionaries. They’re both used to store collections of values. Using arrays and dictionaries, you can work with a lot of data at once and make your programs more powerful!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec1">
<strong>KEEPING THINGS IN ORDER WITH ARRAYS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">An <em>array</em>
 is a list of items of the same data type stored in order, kind of like a numbered grocery list. Items in an array are stored by their <em>index</em>
 , a number based on where the item is positioned in the array.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_68"></span>
 When you write a grocery list, you usually start with the number 1, but in computer programming, an index starts at 0, not 1. So the first item in an array is always at index 0, the second item is at index 1, the third item is at index 2, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s create an array. If you already know what you’re going to put into your array, you can create it and <em>initialize</em>
 it with those values. To initialize something in Swift is to give it some initial value so you can use it in your program. Let’s say that you want to store a list of all of the national parks that you’ve visited. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00114.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code creates an array variable called <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 and initializes it with the names of three national parks. Because we initialized this array to hold strings, you’ll only be able to put strings in it.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a href="text00016.html#ch06fig1">Figure 6-1</a>
 shows how you can imagine your array. It’s like a row of boxes containing the three names of national parks at indices 0, 1, and 2. Remember that the indices of an array always start at 0!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00115.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-1: The <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec1">
<strong>USING MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array is a variable because we created it with the <span class="code">var</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . An array stored in a variable is called a <em>mutable</em>
 array. This means that you can change it by adding items, removing items, or swapping items in and out.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also create an <em>immutable</em>
 array. An immutable array is created with the keyword <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 . Similar to a constant, once an immutable array is created, nothing in it can be changed.</p>
<p class="indent">So when should you use a mutable array or an immutable array? It’s best to use <span class="code">let</span>
 if you know your collection will never change, like if you’re storing the colors of the rainbow. You should use <span class="code">var</span>
 if you need to change your collection, like if you’re storing an array of your favorite T-shirts, which might change depending on what’s in style!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00116.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2"><span id="page_69"></span>
 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_70"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>

 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">In previous chapters, you learned that you can store a single piece of information in a variable or constant. But what if you want to store a collection of things, like the names of all the places you’ve visited or all the books that you’ve read? In this chapter, we’ll introduce you to arrays and dictionaries. They’re both used to store collections of values. Using arrays and dictionaries, you can work with a lot of data at once and make your programs more powerful!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec1">
<strong>KEEPING THINGS IN ORDER WITH ARRAYS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">An <em>array</em>
 is a list of items of the same data type stored in order, kind of like a numbered grocery list. Items in an array are stored by their <em>index</em>
 , a number based on where the item is positioned in the array.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_68"></span>
 When you write a grocery list, you usually start with the number 1, but in computer programming, an index starts at 0, not 1. So the first item in an array is always at index 0, the second item is at index 1, the third item is at index 2, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s create an array. If you already know what you’re going to put into your array, you can create it and <em>initialize</em>
 it with those values. To initialize something in Swift is to give it some initial value so you can use it in your program. Let’s say that you want to store a list of all of the national parks that you’ve visited. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00114.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code creates an array variable called <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 and initializes it with the names of three national parks. Because we initialized this array to hold strings, you’ll only be able to put strings in it.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a href="text00016.html#ch06fig1">Figure 6-1</a>
 shows how you can imagine your array. It’s like a row of boxes containing the three names of national parks at indices 0, 1, and 2. Remember that the indices of an array always start at 0!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00115.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-1: The <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec1">
<strong>USING MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array is a variable because we created it with the <span class="code">var</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . An array stored in a variable is called a <em>mutable</em>
 array. This means that you can change it by adding items, removing items, or swapping items in and out.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also create an <em>immutable</em>
 array. An immutable array is created with the keyword <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 . Similar to a constant, once an immutable array is created, nothing in it can be changed.</p>
<p class="indent">So when should you use a mutable array or an immutable array? It’s best to use <span class="code">let</span>
 if you know your collection will never change, like if you’re storing the colors of the rainbow. You should use <span class="code">var</span>
 if you need to change your collection, like if you’re storing an array of your favorite T-shirts, which might change depending on what’s in style!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00116.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2"><span id="page_69"></span>
 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_70"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>

<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

</html>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec1">
<strong>KEEPING THINGS IN ORDER WITH ARRAYS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">An <em>array</em>
 is a list of items of the same data type stored in order, kind of like a numbered grocery list. Items in an array are stored by their <em>index</em>
 , a number based on where the item is positioned in the array.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_68"></span>
 When you write a grocery list, you usually start with the number 1, but in computer programming, an index starts at 0, not 1. So the first item in an array is always at index 0, the second item is at index 1, the third item is at index 2, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s create an array. If you already know what you’re going to put into your array, you can create it and <em>initialize</em>
 it with those values. To initialize something in Swift is to give it some initial value so you can use it in your program. Let’s say that you want to store a list of all of the national parks that you’ve visited. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00114.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code creates an array variable called <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 and initializes it with the names of three national parks. Because we initialized this array to hold strings, you’ll only be able to put strings in it.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a href="text00016.html#ch06fig1">Figure 6-1</a>
 shows how you can imagine your array. It’s like a row of boxes containing the three names of national parks at indices 0, 1, and 2. Remember that the indices of an array always start at 0!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00115.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-1: The <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec1">
<strong>USING MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array is a variable because we created it with the <span class="code">var</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . An array stored in a variable is called a <em>mutable</em>
 array. This means that you can change it by adding items, removing items, or swapping items in and out.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also create an <em>immutable</em>
 array. An immutable array is created with the keyword <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 . Similar to a constant, once an immutable array is created, nothing in it can be changed.</p>
<p class="indent">So when should you use a mutable array or an immutable array? It’s best to use <span class="code">let</span>
 if you know your collection will never change, like if you’re storing the colors of the rainbow. You should use <span class="code">var</span>
 if you need to change your collection, like if you’re storing an array of your favorite T-shirts, which might change depending on what’s in style!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00116.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2"><span id="page_69"></span>
 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">An <em>array</em>
 is a list of items of the same data type stored in order, kind of like a numbered grocery list. Items in an array are stored by their <em>index</em>
 , a number based on where the item is positioned in the array.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_68"></span>
 When you write a grocery list, you usually start with the number 1, but in computer programming, an index starts at 0, not 1. So the first item in an array is always at index 0, the second item is at index 1, the third item is at index 2, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s create an array. If you already know what you’re going to put into your array, you can create it and <em>initialize</em>
 it with those values. To initialize something in Swift is to give it some initial value so you can use it in your program. Let’s say that you want to store a list of all of the national parks that you’ve visited. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00114.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code creates an array variable called <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 and initializes it with the names of three national parks. Because we initialized this array to hold strings, you’ll only be able to put strings in it.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a href="text00016.html#ch06fig1">Figure 6-1</a>
 shows how you can imagine your array. It’s like a row of boxes containing the three names of national parks at indices 0, 1, and 2. Remember that the indices of an array always start at 0!</p>

<strong>USING MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array is a variable because we created it with the <span class="code">var</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . An array stored in a variable is called a <em>mutable</em>
 array. This means that you can change it by adding items, removing items, or swapping items in and out.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also create an <em>immutable</em>
 array. An immutable array is created with the keyword <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 . Similar to a constant, once an immutable array is created, nothing in it can be changed.</p>
<p class="indent">So when should you use a mutable array or an immutable array? It’s best to use <span class="code">let</span>
 if you know your collection will never change, like if you’re storing the colors of the rainbow. You should use <span class="code">var</span>
 if you need to change your collection, like if you’re storing an array of your favorite T-shirts, which might change depending on what’s in style!</p>

 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_68"></span>
 When you write a grocery list, you usually start with the number 1, but in computer programming, an index starts at 0, not 1. So the first item in an array is always at index 0, the second item is at index 1, the third item is at index 2, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s create an array. If you already know what you’re going to put into your array, you can create it and <em>initialize</em>
 it with those values. To initialize something in Swift is to give it some initial value so you can use it in your program. Let’s say that you want to store a list of all of the national parks that you’ve visited. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00114.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code creates an array variable called <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 and initializes it with the names of three national parks. Because we initialized this array to hold strings, you’ll only be able to put strings in it.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a href="text00016.html#ch06fig1">Figure 6-1</a>
 shows how you can imagine your array. It’s like a row of boxes containing the three names of national parks at indices 0, 1, and 2. Remember that the indices of an array always start at 0!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00115.jpg" alt="Image" />

 array</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec1">
<strong>USING MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array is a variable because we created it with the <span class="code">var</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . An array stored in a variable is called a <em>mutable</em>
 array. This means that you can change it by adding items, removing items, or swapping items in and out.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also create an <em>immutable</em>
 array. An immutable array is created with the keyword <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 . Similar to a constant, once an immutable array is created, nothing in it can be changed.</p>
<p class="indent">So when should you use a mutable array or an immutable array? It’s best to use <span class="code">let</span>
 if you know your collection will never change, like if you’re storing the colors of the rainbow. You should use <span class="code">var</span>
 if you need to change your collection, like if you’re storing an array of your favorite T-shirts, which might change depending on what’s in style!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00116.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2"><span id="page_69"></span>
 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00136.jpg" alt="Image" />

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Let’s create an array. If you already know what you’re going to put into your array, you can create it and <em>initialize</em>
 it with those values. To initialize something in Swift is to give it some initial value so you can use it in your program. Let’s say that you want to store a list of all of the national parks that you’ve visited. Enter the following into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00114.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code creates an array variable called <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 and initializes it with the names of three national parks. Because we initialized this array to hold strings, you’ll only be able to put strings in it.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a href="text00016.html#ch06fig1">Figure 6-1</a>
 shows how you can imagine your array. It’s like a row of boxes containing the three names of national parks at indices 0, 1, and 2. Remember that the indices of an array always start at 0!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00115.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-1: The <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec1">
<strong>USING MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array is a variable because we created it with the <span class="code">var</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . An array stored in a variable is called a <em>mutable</em>
 array. This means that you can change it by adding items, removing items, or swapping items in and out.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also create an <em>immutable</em>
 array. An immutable array is created with the keyword <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 . Similar to a constant, once an immutable array is created, nothing in it can be changed.</p>
<p class="indent">So when should you use a mutable array or an immutable array? It’s best to use <span class="code">let</span>
 if you know your collection will never change, like if you’re storing the colors of the rainbow. You should use <span class="code">var</span>
 if you need to change your collection, like if you’re storing an array of your favorite T-shirts, which might change depending on what’s in style!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00116.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2"><span id="page_69"></span>
 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_70"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00114.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code creates an array variable called <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 and initializes it with the names of three national parks. Because we initialized this array to hold strings, you’ll only be able to put strings in it.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a href="text00016.html#ch06fig1">Figure 6-1</a>
 shows how you can imagine your array. It’s like a row of boxes containing the three names of national parks at indices 0, 1, and 2. Remember that the indices of an array always start at 0!</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec1">
<strong>USING MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array is a variable because we created it with the <span class="code">var</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . An array stored in a variable is called a <em>mutable</em>
 array. This means that you can change it by adding items, removing items, or swapping items in and out.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also create an <em>immutable</em>
 array. An immutable array is created with the keyword <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 . Similar to a constant, once an immutable array is created, nothing in it can be changed.</p>
<p class="indent">So when should you use a mutable array or an immutable array? It’s best to use <span class="code">let</span>
 if you know your collection will never change, like if you’re storing the colors of the rainbow. You should use <span class="code">var</span>
 if you need to change your collection, like if you’re storing an array of your favorite T-shirts, which might change depending on what’s in style!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00116.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2"><span id="page_69"></span>
 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>

<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">This code creates an array variable called <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 and initializes it with the names of three national parks. Because we initialized this array to hold strings, you’ll only be able to put strings in it.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a href="text00016.html#ch06fig1">Figure 6-1</a>
 shows how you can imagine your array. It’s like a row of boxes containing the three names of national parks at indices 0, 1, and 2. Remember that the indices of an array always start at 0!</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec1">
<strong>USING MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array is a variable because we created it with the <span class="code">var</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . An array stored in a variable is called a <em>mutable</em>
 array. This means that you can change it by adding items, removing items, or swapping items in and out.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also create an <em>immutable</em>
 array. An immutable array is created with the keyword <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 . Similar to a constant, once an immutable array is created, nothing in it can be changed.</p>
<p class="indent">So when should you use a mutable array or an immutable array? It’s best to use <span class="code">let</span>
 if you know your collection will never change, like if you’re storing the colors of the rainbow. You should use <span class="code">var</span>
 if you need to change your collection, like if you’re storing an array of your favorite T-shirts, which might change depending on what’s in style!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00116.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2"><span id="page_69"></span>
 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>

<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />

 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<a href="text00016.html#ch06fig1">Figure 6-1</a>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec1">
<strong>USING MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array is a variable because we created it with the <span class="code">var</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . An array stored in a variable is called a <em>mutable</em>
 array. This means that you can change it by adding items, removing items, or swapping items in and out.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also create an <em>immutable</em>
 array. An immutable array is created with the keyword <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 . Similar to a constant, once an immutable array is created, nothing in it can be changed.</p>
<p class="indent">So when should you use a mutable array or an immutable array? It’s best to use <span class="code">let</span>
 if you know your collection will never change, like if you’re storing the colors of the rainbow. You should use <span class="code">var</span>
 if you need to change your collection, like if you’re storing an array of your favorite T-shirts, which might change depending on what’s in style!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00116.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2"><span id="page_69"></span>
 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>

<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec1">
<strong>USING MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array is a variable because we created it with the <span class="code">var</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . An array stored in a variable is called a <em>mutable</em>
 array. This means that you can change it by adding items, removing items, or swapping items in and out.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also create an <em>immutable</em>
 array. An immutable array is created with the keyword <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 . Similar to a constant, once an immutable array is created, nothing in it can be changed.</p>
<p class="indent">So when should you use a mutable array or an immutable array? It’s best to use <span class="code">let</span>
 if you know your collection will never change, like if you’re storing the colors of the rainbow. You should use <span class="code">var</span>
 if you need to change your collection, like if you’re storing an array of your favorite T-shirts, which might change depending on what’s in style!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00116.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2"><span id="page_69"></span>
 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec1">
<strong>USING MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array is a variable because we created it with the <span class="code">var</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . An array stored in a variable is called a <em>mutable</em>
 array. This means that you can change it by adding items, removing items, or swapping items in and out.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also create an <em>immutable</em>
 array. An immutable array is created with the keyword <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 . Similar to a constant, once an immutable array is created, nothing in it can be changed.</p>
<p class="indent">So when should you use a mutable array or an immutable array? It’s best to use <span class="code">let</span>
 if you know your collection will never change, like if you’re storing the colors of the rainbow. You should use <span class="code">var</span>
 if you need to change your collection, like if you’re storing an array of your favorite T-shirts, which might change depending on what’s in style!</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2"><span id="page_69"></span>
 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<strong>USING MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array is a variable because we created it with the <span class="code">var</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . An array stored in a variable is called a <em>mutable</em>
 array. This means that you can change it by adding items, removing items, or swapping items in and out.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also create an <em>immutable</em>
 array. An immutable array is created with the keyword <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 . Similar to a constant, once an immutable array is created, nothing in it can be changed.</p>
<p class="indent">So when should you use a mutable array or an immutable array? It’s best to use <span class="code">let</span>
 if you know your collection will never change, like if you’re storing the colors of the rainbow. You should use <span class="code">var</span>
 if you need to change your collection, like if you’re storing an array of your favorite T-shirts, which might change depending on what’s in style!</p>

 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00136.jpg" alt="Image" />

 <em>Figure 6-4: Output of the example <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">Our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array is a variable because we created it with the <span class="code">var</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . An array stored in a variable is called a <em>mutable</em>
 array. This means that you can change it by adding items, removing items, or swapping items in and out.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also create an <em>immutable</em>
 array. An immutable array is created with the keyword <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 . Similar to a constant, once an immutable array is created, nothing in it can be changed.</p>
<p class="indent">So when should you use a mutable array or an immutable array? It’s best to use <span class="code">let</span>
 if you know your collection will never change, like if you’re storing the colors of the rainbow. You should use <span class="code">var</span>
 if you need to change your collection, like if you’re storing an array of your favorite T-shirts, which might change depending on what’s in style!</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2"><span id="page_69"></span>
 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_70"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00136.jpg" alt="Image" />

 <em>Figure 6-4: Output of the example <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>

<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>

 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">You can also create an <em>immutable</em>
 array. An immutable array is created with the keyword <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 . Similar to a constant, once an immutable array is created, nothing in it can be changed.</p>
<p class="indent">So when should you use a mutable array or an immutable array? It’s best to use <span class="code">let</span>
 if you know your collection will never change, like if you’re storing the colors of the rainbow. You should use <span class="code">var</span>
 if you need to change your collection, like if you’re storing an array of your favorite T-shirts, which might change depending on what’s in style!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00116.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2"><span id="page_69"></span>
 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

</div>

 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">So when should you use a mutable array or an immutable array? It’s best to use <span class="code">let</span>
 if you know your collection will never change, like if you’re storing the colors of the rainbow. You should use <span class="code">var</span>
 if you need to change your collection, like if you’re storing an array of your favorite T-shirts, which might change depending on what’s in style!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00116.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2"><span id="page_69"></span>
 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_70"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00136.jpg" alt="Image" />

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2"><span id="page_69"></span>
 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>

</html>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec2"><span id="page_69"></span>
 <strong>USING TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_70"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00136.jpg" alt="Image" />

</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">When we created our <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array, we specified that we were creating an array of string values by adding a colon (<span class="code">:</span>
 ) and <span class="code">[String]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This step is optional when you create an array and initialize it with one or more values because Swift will use type inference to determine the kind of data you want the array to hold. That means that you could just as easily have created the array by doing this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>

<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations!

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00117.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>

 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Using type inference, Swift knows we initialized this array to hold strings, and it can hold only strings.</p>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>

 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">The list of parks that we created the array with is an example of an array <em>literal</em>
 . A literal is a value that is exactly what you see. It is not a variable or constant but rather just the value without a name. <span class="code">"Grand Canyon"</span>
 is an example of a string literal, and <span class="code">7</span>
 is an example of an integer literal. An array literal is a list of items contained between two square brackets and separated by commas, like <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>

<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

</html>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec3">
<strong>ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_70"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>

<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to access an item in your array and use it in your program. Your friend asks you to tell them all about your travels, so you want to use the names of the national parks that you stored in the array. To access an item in your array, write the array name followed by the item’s index inside square brackets:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_70"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>

<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00118.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>

<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">In this example, we are accessing the names of the national parks and then printing them to the screen using <span class="code">print</span>
 . To get the first item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[0]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . To access the second item in <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 , you use <span class="code">nationalParks[1]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>

<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec4">
<strong>WATCHING THE RANGE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

 <em>Figure 6-2: Trying to access an index in the array where nothing exists causes an error.</em>
</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>

<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">One important point about arrays is that if you try to access an item at an index that’s higher than the last index in the array, you’ll get an error. In <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig2">Figure 6-2</a>
 , you can see that <span class="code">nationalParks[3]</span>
 (which would be the fourth item in the array) gives you an error because there are only three national parks in the array, indexed from 0 to 2.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>

 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you get an error message that says <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 . If you try to access an item that doesn’t exist in your array, your app will crash!</p>

</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>

<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>

 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations!

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>

 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

</html>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec5">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations!

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">One way to change an array is to add new items to it. There are a few different ways to do this, so let’s take a look at each.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">First, you can use an array’s <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method. <em>Append</em>
 means to add something. Using <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 , you can add one new item to the end of your array. Say you go on another trip and visit the Badlands, and you want to add it to your list of national parks. To do that, add this code into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00120.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>

<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />

 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">To use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method, first write the name of your array followed by a period and then <span class="code">append</span>
 . Then, put the item you want to add to your array inside the parentheses. In this case, you put <span class="code">"Badlands"</span>
 inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">If you want to add something at a specific place in your array, use the array’s <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method instead. This method takes two arguments: the item that you want to insert and the index of where it should go in the array. (We’ll discuss arguments in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you totally forgot that you went to the Petrified Forest right after you visited the Grand Canyon, and you want to update your <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 array so it displays the parks in the order in which you visited them. To update your array, you could use the <span class="code">insert(_:at:)</span>
 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">

 method to put the Petrified Forest in the right position:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00121.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>

<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />

<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>

 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>

 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>

<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

</div>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />

 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>

<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>

<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>

<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">When you insert a new item at index 3, everything that was in the array at index 3 or higher gets scooted over to make room for the new item. That means the item that was at index 3 is now at index 4, the item that was at <span id="page_71"></span>
 index 4 is now at index 5, and so on. After you add the Petrified Forest, <span class="code">nationalParks</span>
 is now <span class="code">["Acadia", "Zion", "Grand Canyon", "Petrified Forest", "Badlands"]</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>

<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec6">
<strong>COMBINING ARRAYS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>

 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>

<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>

 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>

 .</p>

 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">Not only can you add new items to an array, but you can also add two arrays together using the <span class="code">+</span>
 and <span class="code">+=</span>
 operators. Let’s say that you have the ingredients for a fruit smoothie in two arrays:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>

 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00122.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00136.jpg" alt="Image" />

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Now you can make a delicious smoothie by adding the <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 arrays.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00123.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The order of the ingredients in <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 is the same as the order in <span class="code">fruits</span>
 and <span class="code">liquids</span>
 . If you created <span class="code">smoothie</span>
 with <span class="code">liquids + fruits</span>
 , then the <span class="code">liquids</span>
 would come first.</p>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>

Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">

<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>

<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>

 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">You use the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator to add an array to the end of your array. Add some whipped cream as follows for extra yumminess:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00124.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>

 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Note that <span class="code">["whipped cream"]</span>
 is an array even though it has a single item in it. When you’re using <span class="code">+=</span>
 to append something to an array, you have to make sure you’re only trying to add another array. If you were to just write the string <span class="code">"whipped cream"</span>
 without the square brackets around it, you would get an error.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00125.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec7">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />

<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>

 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>

<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>

 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">There are several methods for removing items from an array. Let’s start by looking at the array’s <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method. As you might have guessed from its name, <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 removes the last item from your array. Let’s try it out with a <span class="code">shoppingList</span>
 array:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>

<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>

<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00126.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_72"></span>
 Neat! Note that the <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 method returns the removed item, so you can store it in a new constant or variable if you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove an item from a specific index by using the <span class="code">remove(at:)</span>
 method. Let’s say that your mom doesn’t want you buying any candy and takes that off the list:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00127.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">

 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00128.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>

 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />

<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>

 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Just like when we added an item to the middle of our array and all the items scooted over to make room, if you remove an item from the middle of an array, the rest of the items will scoot back to fill in that empty space. The <span class="code">"apples"</span>
 item that was at index 3 is now at index 2, where <span class="code">"candy"</span>
 was.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also remove all items from an array with <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 . Try entering this into your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00129.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>

 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>

<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Note that trying to remove an item at an index that doesn’t exist will give you an error:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00130.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Our array doesn’t have this many items (in fact, now it’s empty!), so this throws an error. We’ll also get an error if we use <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 on our empty array, because there’s nothing in it—there’s no last index at all! However, <span class="code">removeAll()</span>
 is always safe to use, even on an empty array.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec8">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">

<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>

<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>

 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>

 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>

 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>

<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">To replace an item in an array, you set the index of the array to the new value, as shown here:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00131.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>
 .</p>

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig3"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">

<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>

 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 2 (the third item) with <span class="code">"Unicorn"</span>
 because magical animals count as favorite animals, too! At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we replaced the item at index 0 (the first item) with <span class="code">"Bearded dragon"</span>
 . No, that’s not a real dragon—it’s just a lizard!</p>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>

 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>

<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00137.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>

 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Like any time you’re working with array index numbers, you have to be sure an item exists in the array at that index before you change its value, or you will get an <span class="code">Index out of range</span>
 error.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_73"></span>
 <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig3">Figure 6-3</a>
 shows the error that occurs if you try to add <span class="code">"Standard poodle"</span>
 using <span class="code">favoriteAnimals[3] = "Standard poodle"</span>
 . To add an item to the end of an array, you should use the <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 method or <span class="code">+=</span>
 , as we covered in “<a href="text00016.html#ch06lev2sec5">Adding Items to an Array</a>
 ” on <a href="text00016.html#page_70">page 70</a>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>

Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>

 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>

<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>

<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>

<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>

 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>

<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>

<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>

<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>

 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>

<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

 <em>Figure 6-3: Don’t try to replace a value at an index beyond the existing array.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00133.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec9">
<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />

<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<p class="indent">Now you know how to change arrays however you might need to. You can add items, take items away, or replace items. Next, we’ll look at how to use the properties of arrays to find out even more information about them.</p>

<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />

 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>

<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>

<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />

 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<strong>USING ARRAY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to methods like <span class="code">append(_:)</span>
 and <span class="code">removeLast()</span>
 , arrays also have <em>properties</em>
 . An array’s properties are variables or constants that contain some information about the array. Two really helpful properties that you might use are the Boolean property <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 and the integer property <span class="code">count</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />

 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>

<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch06fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property is true or false depending on whether the array is empty, and the <span class="code">count</span>
 property will tell you how many items are in that array.</p>
<p class="indent">Check out how these two properties are used in the following <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00134.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>

<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations!

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>

<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00151.jpg" alt="Image" />

 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">This <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement checks whether the array <span class="code">mySiblings</span>
 is empty <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . If it is, then <span class="code">"I don't have any siblings."</span>
 is printed. But if there is something in the array, then the number of siblings that we have is printed: <span class="code">"I have 3 siblings."</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><span id="page_74"></span>
 <strong>LOOPING OVER AN ARRAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>

 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>

 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>

</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>

<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

</html>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes when you’re working with arrays you might want to do something to every item in the array. You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do that! The following code will print every topping in a <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array on a separate line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00135.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop in <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig4">Figure 6-4</a>

<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations!

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<p class="indent">To write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop for the <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 array, we used the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by the constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 , then the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , and finally the name of our array, <span class="code">pizzaToppings</span>
 . Then we put the statements that we want to run for each <span class="code">topping</span>
 inside the braces of the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. The constant <span class="code">topping</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 temporarily represents each pizza topping in the array as we loop through it. We could have chosen any name for this constant, but it’s a good idea to pick something that makes sense. You can see the output of this <span class="code">for-in</span>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>

<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>

<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations! The following code takes an array of numbers and calculates the square for each (the square of a number is that number multiplied by itself):</p>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">

<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>

<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>

<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<p class="indent">Using <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops is great for printing every value in an array. If you’re working with numbers, you can even use them to perform math operations on each item, which makes for some speedy calculations!

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>

 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>

<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>

<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>

<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec2">
<strong>DICTIONARIES ARE KEY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <em>dictionary</em>
 is also a collection of values, but instead of an ordered index, each value has its own <em>key</em>
 . Because there’s no index, the values are not stored in any particular order. To access values in a dictionary, you look them up by their key.</p>
<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>

<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>

<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>

 , in the <span class="code">values</span>

<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>

<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<p class="indent">A key must be unique. You can’t have the same key more than once in the same dictionary. If there were two identical keys and you asked the computer to give you the value for one of them, the computer wouldn’t know which one to choose!</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at how to make a dictionary and write keys that will help you find all the information you need.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00140.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11">
<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>

<strong>INITIALIZING A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To create and initialize a dictionary, first write <span class="code">var</span>
 and the name of your dictionary. Then write the keys and corresponding values inside a pair of square brackets, similar to an array. Let’s create a dictionary to store the names of a few US states. The key for each state will be its two-letter abbreviation:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>

<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>

<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>

<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00141.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, there’s a colon between each key and its value, and the key/value pairs are separated by commas.</p>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />

<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>

 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>

 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>

<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec3">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Dictionaries are different from arrays in that they are <em>unordered</em>
 . Because of that, it’s likely that the order of the states that you see in your results pane <span class="ent">➋</span>
 is different from the order in which you entered your states <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . It might even be different than the order that’s printed in this book!</p>
<p class="indent">As with arrays, you can use <span class="code">var</span>
 to make a mutable dictionary or use <span class="code">let</span>
 to make an immutable dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_76"></span>
 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">

 In Swift, all of the keys of a dictionary must be the same type, and all of the values of a dictionary must also be the same type, but the key type doesn’t have to match the value type. For example, if you wanted to store a collection of fractions, you could use doubles for the keys and strings for the values:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00142.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">In this dictionary, all of the keys must be doubles, and all of the values must be strings. Again, you’ll see that the order of the numbers in the results pane can be quite different from the order in which you wrote the fractions in your dictionary. This is fine because you don’t need to know the order to access anything. You can find any item that you need by its key. Let’s see how!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

 <em>Figure 6-6: Looping through the keys and values of a dictionary with a <span class="code">for-in</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>

<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language.

 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12">
<strong>ACCESSING VALUES IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking up a value in a dictionary is similar to how you access a value in an array except that you use a key inside the square brackets instead of an index, like this: <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">There is a big difference, however, in how Swift returns the values from a dictionary. When you access a value at an index of an array, you are simply given the value. When you access a value with a key in a dictionary, you are given an optional.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>
 to our <span class="code">usStates</span>
 dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>

<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>

<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , you learned that optionals might contain a value or might be <span class="code">nil</span>
 . The reason Swift returns optionals when you’re looking up items in a dictionary is that the key you used might not exist in the dictionary, in which case there’s no value to access. Trying to access a value that doesn’t exist would give you a big fat error! To avoid that problem, Swift returns optionals. That means you need to unwrap any value you get out of a dictionary before you can do anything with it.</p>
<p class="indent">To unwrap an optional, first you check whether it exists using an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, just like we did in <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 . The following code shows you how to get a value out of a dictionary:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00143.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00144.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>
 , <span class="code">usStates</span>
 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>

 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00147.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16">
<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>
 shows the output of both loops.</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

</html>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_77"></span>
 To retrieve <span class="code">"Texas"</span>
 from the dictionary, we use <span class="code">if let</span>
 to set a constant <span class="code">loneStarState</span>
 to <span class="code">usStates["TX"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Because we have this state in our dictionary, the line <span class="code">I have Texas in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed. Next we try to access a state that is not in our dictionary by using the key <span class="code">usStates["FL"]</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . Thankfully, because we used an <span class="code">if-let</span>
 statement, the program won’t crash when the computer can’t find this state. Instead, <span class="code">I don't have that state in my dictionary.</span>
 is printed.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13">
<strong>ADDING ITEMS TO A DICTIONARY</strong>

<p class="noindent">To add an item to a dictionary, first write the name of your dictionary and assign the new item to the key you want it to have in the dictionary. Let’s add <span class="code">"Minnesota"</span>

 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>
 , which contains all of the dictionary’s keys, and <span class="code">values</span>
 , which contains all of its values. We’ll use these two properties when we loop through the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17">
<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement printed three times. <a href="text00016.html#ch06fig6">Figure 6-6</a>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<p class="indent">Now when you look at <span class="code">usStates</span>
 , you’ll see that it’s updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "MA": "Massachusetts", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember, because you don’t have to rely on indices, your new dictionary item might appear anywhere in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14">
<strong>REMOVING ITEMS FROM A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Removing an item from a dictionary is quite simple; you do so by setting the value to <span class="code">nil</span>
 . Because the values in dictionaries are returned as optionals, you don’t have to worry about <span class="code">nil</span>
 causing any problems in your dictionary.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00145.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that after you remove the value at the key <span class="code">"MA"</span>

 is updated to <span class="code">["MN": "Minnesota", "WA": "Washington", "TX": "Texas"]</span>
 . Remember that <span class="code">nil</span>
 is special and means that there’s no value at all. That’s why you don’t see <span class="code">"MA": nil</span>
 in our dictionary.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15">
<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00146.jpg" />
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 for <span class="code">"red"</span>
 , but then we decided that <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 is a better fruit to use since sometimes apples are green or yellow. To replace <span class="code">"apple"</span>
 with <span class="code">"raspberry"</span>
 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>

<strong>REPLACING ITEMS IN A DICTIONARY</strong>

<p class="noindent">Replacing an item in a dictionary is also easy. It works the same was as replacing an item in an array. You just set the item that you want to replace to something else. Say you create a dictionary of fruit colors:</p>

<p class="indent"><span id="page_78"></span>
 At first we had the value <span class="code">"apple"</span>

 , we set <span class="code">colorFruits["red"]</span>
 to its new value <span class="ent">➊</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You may remember that this is the same way we entered a new value into a dictionary. If the key already exists in the dictionary, then the value for that key is replaced. If the key doesn’t already exist, then the new key/value pair will be added to the dictionary.</p>

<strong>USING DICTIONARY PROPERTIES</strong>

<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00148.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">A dictionary also has two special properties: <span class="code">keys</span>

<p class="indent">Let’s write some code that loops through our fruit baskets and prints the price of each fruit.</p>

<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>

<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>

 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>

<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>

<strong>LOOPING OVER A DICTIONARY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can loop through a dictionary using a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. Because each item has a key and a value, you can do this in two different ways. This is how to loop through a dictionary using its keys:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00149.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we use the dictionary’s <span class="code">keys</span>
 property <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to loop through <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 and print its contents. We start by writing the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a constant name <span class="code">fruit</span>
 for the dictionary key, the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 , the dictionary name, a period, and <span class="code">keys</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_79"></span>
 Inside the braces of our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we have access to both the key, which we call <span class="code">fruit</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , and the value at that key when we force-unwrap its contents with <span class="code">fruitBasket[fruit]!</span>
 <span class="ent">➌</span>
 . That value will be the fruit’s price.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it’s safe to force-unwrap the value using an exclamation point because we know that the <span class="code">fruit</span>
 key we’re using is definitely inside the dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Any code we put inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run once for every key in our dictionary. So you should see the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement display three times.</p>
<p class="indent">We can also loop through the dictionary using its <span class="code">values</span>
 property:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00150.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We use the same style of <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, but now we use a constant to refer to each value, which we call <span class="code">price</span>
 , in the <span class="code">values</span>
 property. When looping through values, we don’t have access to the keys from inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">Another difference to note is that <span class="code">price</span>
 is not an optional because it’s accessed directly as a value in the <span class="code">fruitBasket</span>
 dictionary. That means we don’t have to unwrap it. You should still see the <span class="code">print</span>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>

<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

</html>
<p class="noindent">Like an array, a dictionary also has an <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property and a <span class="code">count</span>
 property. For example, the following code shows how you can use the <span class="code">isEmpty</span>
 property to check if a dictionary is empty, and if it isn’t empty, the <span class="code">count</span>
 property checks how many items you have. Imagine you have a basket of fruit for sale. You can use these properties to help you keep track of everything:</p>

<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to store collections of items in an array and in a dictionary. To store items in an ordered list, you would use an array and look up each item by its index. If you wanted to store items by key instead, you would use a dictionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing about arrays and dictionaries and how to use them is a powerful building block for almost any programming language. Next we will learn about functions, another very powerful tool. Functions are blocks of code that you create and name to perform a specific job. After you have written a function, you can use its name to call it from almost anywhere in your program.<span id="page_80"></span>

<p class="indent">The order of your results might be slightly different from ours. That’s because the items in a dictionary aren’t in a numbered order like they are in an array! And because the order is not guaranteed, you might see a different order printed if you run the same code again.</p>

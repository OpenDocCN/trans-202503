- en: '*Self-attention* enables a neural network to refer to other portions of the
    input while focusing on a particular segment, essentially allowing each part the
    ability to “attend” to the whole input. The original attention mechanism developed
    for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is applied between two different sequences:
    the encoder and the decoder embeddings. Since the attention mechanisms used in
    transformer-based large language models is designed to work on all elements of
    the same set, it is known as *self*-attention.'

- en: One example of an attention mechanism used in RNNs to handle long sequences
    is *Bahdanau attention*. Bahdanau attention was developed to make machine learning
    models, particularly those used in translating languages, better at understanding
    long sentences. Before this type of attention, the whole input (such as a sentence
    in English) was squashed into a single chunk of information, and important details
    could get lost, especially if the sentence was long.

- en: 'In short, the original attention mechanism developed for RNNs is applied between
    two different sequences: the encoder and decoder embeddings. For each generated
    output sequence element, the decoder RNN at the top is based on a hidden state
    plus a context vector generated by the encoder. This context vector involves *all*
    elements of the input sequence and is a weighted sum of all input elements where
    the attention scores (*α*’s) represent the weighting coefficients. This allows
    the decoder to access all input sequence elements (the context) at each step.
    The key idea is that the attention weights (and context) may differ and change
    dynamically at each step.'

  zh: 简而言之，原始的RNN注意力机制应用于两个不同的序列之间：编码器和解码器嵌入。对于每个生成的输出序列元素，顶部的解码器RNN基于隐藏状态和编码器生成的上下文向量。这个上下文向量涉及输入序列的*所有*元素，并且是所有输入元素的加权和，其中注意力得分（*α*）代表加权系数。这使得解码器在每一步都能访问到所有输入序列元素（上下文）。关键思想是，注意力权重（和上下文）可能会在每一步动态变化。
- en: The motivation behind this complicated encoder-decoder design is that we cannot
    translate sentences word by word. This would result in grammatically incorrect

- en: RNN architecture (a) is best suited for time series tasks in which we want to
    make one prediction at a time, such as predicting a given stock price day by day.
    For tasks like language translation, we typically opt for an encoder-decoder RNN,
    as in architecture (b) in [Figure 16-2](ch16.xhtml#ch16fig2). Here, the RNN encodes
    the input sentence, stores it in an intermediate hidden representation, and generates
    the output sentence. However, this creates a bottleneck where the RNN has to memorize
    the whole input sentence via a single hidden state, which does not work well for
    longer sequences.

- en: The bottleneck depicted in architecture (b) prompted the Bahdanau attention
    mechanism’s original design, allowing the decoder to access all elements in the
    input sentence at each time step. The attention scores also give different weights
    to the different input elements depending on the current word that the decoder
    generates. For example, when generating the word *help* in the output sequence,
    the word *helfen* in the German input sentence may get a large attention weight,
    as it’s highly relevant in this context.

- en: The Bahdanau attention mechanism relies on a somewhat complicated encoder-decoder
    design to model long-term dependencies in sequence-to-sequence language modeling
    tasks. Approximately three years after the Bahdanau mechanism, researchers worked
    on simplifying sequence-to-sequence modeling architectures by asking whether the
    RNN backbone was even needed to achieve good language translation performance.
    This led to the design of the original transformer architecture and self-attention
    mechanism.

    to the attention mechanism for RNNs, the context vector is an attention-weighted
    sum over the input sequence elements.

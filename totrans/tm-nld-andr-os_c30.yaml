    of Google. Even though the tiny Android startup was absorbed into the much larger
    company, Andy went out of his way to keep the team separate.

    we needed to be separate from the larger Google culture and come up with our own
    culture to make this happen. I don’t know how he sold it to Eric, Larry, and Sergey,
    but he got it done. We were isolated and operated like a small startup, with funding
    from Google.”

    of the company “gave the team breathing room without having to constantly report
    in to big-G Google to do things.”

    was walled off from Google. That was really a top-down decision. I remember feeling
    that that wasn’t a good idea and feeling opposed to that idea. I really wanted
    us to connect and build bridges and participate in Google culture. That really
    didn’t happen.”

    project secret within the company and not participating in larger discussions
    and company meetings, which the team felt would have bogged things down.

    every release. But much like the physical separation of Australia from the rest
    of the world’s continents resulted in bizarre subspecies, Android developed a
    culture that was different, and a bit more reckless, than that of its larger,
    steadier, corporate parent.

    that it endowed on the team. “We were a little startup within Google. We were
    shielded from the rest of the big company. We were this little enclave, and we
    had a lot of autonomy. Once you were in, everybody knew that you were on board
    towards that mission.

    it was a fundamentally different product from what everyone else at Google worked
    on. Google, at the time, developed primarily web applications. This resulted in
    two important implications with respect to Android: unhappiness within Google
    that Android was not web-based, and incomprehension of the timeframe realities
    of mobile software.'

- en: First, there was a core distrust of what Android was doing because Google was
    fundamentally about web technologies. So much was possible using the web at that
    time; why wasn’t Android based around web technologies instead? The fact that
    other mobile platforms at the time (including Palm’s WebOS and even the iPhone,
    where Apple’s original plan for external developers was web apps) were using web
    technologies bolstered this argument. Yet Android stubbornly refused to go in
    that direction.^([2](#c30-footnote-2)) It offered the ability to integrate web
    content in native applications (through WebView, as well as offering a complete
    browser app), but applications were expected to be built with native (not web)
    technology, including a different language, different APIs, and overall different
    approach than web apps.

    from the web app products that Google was used to writing. If you want to ship
    a new version of Search, you could do it this afternoon. And if there’s a bug
    in that version, you could fix it and update the app later tonight. Web products
    tend to have regular releases every few weeks, and teams launch and iterate constantly.
    But Android had very different constraints that made that approach and that mindset
    unworkable.

    manufacturing component, there’s a carrier component, there are partnerships.
    You can launch and iterate a search algorithm. You can’t launch and iterate a
    piece of hardware. You have to set a date and work backwards.”'

    electronics, and somebody’s committing a factory line, or they’re lining up a
    big marketing campaign to hit their sales targets, you can’t miss or you really
    mess up things for your partners. You get a little crazy when you’re trying to
    hit those deadlines, because the consequences if you miss the window . . . you
    might not be able to ship that product three months later. You might *never* be
    able to ship that product, because now you have to build a whole different product.”'

    “It’s all web stuff: you ship it, and if it doesn’t work, you roll it back. It’s
    not quite as easy when you’re burning images at the factory.”^([3](#c30-footnote-3))'

    talked about this hardware-driven dynamic: “Android was the first team that taught
    me that Christmas ends in October. If you want your device to hit the market for
    Christmas, everything has to be done by October. It was such crazy deadlines because
    boards^([4](#c30-footnote-4)) had to be finalized. It was the first time that
    I had real deadlines that could not be missed. Christmas doesn’t wait for anyone
    and boards can only be printed so fast, so you cannot miss the October deadline.”'

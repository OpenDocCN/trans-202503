- en: Alligator clip jumper cables (as seen in Chapter 2 on page 19) essentially are
    wires with alligator clips on both ends. They provide a quick and easy way to
    connect nearly anything together, as long as the electrical contact can fit in
    the clip’s mouth. Alligator clips are great for attaching wires, switches, and
    motor terminals together temporarily. Keep in mind that while these connections
    are convenient for prototyping, they aren’t the most durable of connections.

- en: Crimp connectors provide another easy way to join wires together without soldering.
    By crimping or clamping a connector onto the end of each wire, you can join two
    wires together. Sometimes crimp connectors simply slide together, and sometimes
    you need additional hardware, like a nut and bolt, to keep them together. The
    downsides to crimp connectors are that they’re a little bulky and the electrical
    connections are exposed and need to be insulated.

- en: To crimp the connector onto the wire, strip about 1/2 inch of insulation off
    the end of the wire and slide the wire into the barrel of the connector. Then,
    compress the barrel to grab onto the wire. Place the connector on a sturdy, flat
    surface and bash the connector’s barrel with a hammer until it is flat.

    If your wire stripper has this feature, line up the groove in the crimping tool
    that matches the size of your wire and then squeeze down firmly.

- en: Another quick and dirty way to connect wires together involves using a mechanical
    lever, spring connector, or screw terminal. They all work in a similar way. Start
    by lifting the lever, pressing down on the spring-loaded button, or unthreading
    the screw to open the connector. Next, insert the wire, and then press the lever,
    release the spring, or tighten the screw to hold the wire in place and make an
    electrical connection. This method is one of the fastest and easiest ways to connect
    wires together; however, these connectors are bulky, and with enough force, you
    can potentially pull the wires loose.

    to make power connections. If you want to connect batteries to one or more parallel
    motors, simply attach one connector to a battery pack and the other to a motor
    by inserting the wires into the connector’s screw terminals. Finally, insert the
    barrel plug into the barrel socket, and you’re in business.

    terminals are wired in an H-bridge configuration (see page 30 in Chapter 3). The
    lever switch makes or breaks the power connection to the electromagnetic coil.
    If the coil is powered, the motor drives backward. If the coil is unpowered, the
    motor drives forward.

- en: This circuit consists of two switches that each power the coil using separate
    electrical paths. One path passes through the first switch wired to be normally
    open (NO). To do this, connect a wire to its NO connection as well as to its common
    C connection and the relay coil. The second path passes through two of the relay
    terminals not being used for the H-bridge. To do this, wire a switch to be normally
    closed (NC) by connecting a wire to its NC connection as well as to its common
    C connection and the relay coil.

    through the coil, and it becomes energized. This toggles the relay that reverses
    the motor direction using the H-bridge wiring. It also completes the second switch
    circuit that powers the coil.

    However, power continues to flow through the other normally closed switch to the
    coil. As long as this switch remains closed, the coil will remain powered and
    the motor will continue spinning in reverse. If you want the motor to spin forward
    again, the only way is to break the electrical connection to the circuit by pressing
    the NC switch.

    to the relay coil, which toggles the relay terminals, causing the motor to spin
    forward once again. This also breaks the power connection inside the relay to
    the normally closed switch, preventing it from powering the coil. From here, the
    process can start over again.

- en: 'Many commentators dismiss the fear of terrorism as irrational, and in some
    myopic sense, they might be right. Although there are regions where this calculation
    doesn’t hold true, the odds of dying at the hands of a terrorist in the United
    States or Europe are about as low as of getting struck by lightning. At the same
    time, I feel that the experts’ view misses the point. In the two-step plan I’ve
    outlined, the first goal is socioeconomic disruption—and in that respect, terrorists
    often succeed. It’s only the second objective that usually fails: radicalizing
    enough people to join their fight.'

- en: In the United States, the events of September 11—the deadliest terrorist attack
    in the history of the planet—are a raw wound in the memory of my generation. But
    much like Europe, the United States bears many more scars from other harrowing
    terror campaigns. The assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 and the shooting
    of Ronald Reagan in 1981 reshaped the very institution of the presidency—and likely
    cemented the support for the sweeping expansion of the country’s gun laws, as
    enacted in 1968, 1986, and 1991\. The devastating Oklahoma City bombing in 1995,
    itself purportedly a reprisal for the grotesquely mishandled standoffs at Waco
    and Ruby Ridge, catalyzed radical militia movements and fed into the enduring
    siege mentality across many law enforcement agencies. The decades-long bombing
    campaign carried out by Ted Kaczynski, a brilliant Polish-American mathematician
    with a mix of apocalyptic and pro-environmental beliefs, sowed fear throughout
    the nation’s institutions well into the 1990s—and in the end, salvaged the reputation
    of the scandal-plagued Federal Bureau of Investigation.

- en: Many other incidents—the anthrax letters of the 2000s, the brazen Olympic Park
    bombing of 1996, the killings of abortion clinic doctors and the activities of
    radical pro-animal activists, the Weathermen, the mysterious 2013 attack at a
    California power station,^([20](b02.xhtml#c03-endnote-20)) and on and on—are all
    but forgotten in the annals of history, but should serve as a reminder that terrorism
    is a looming and profound threat. We need not succumb to anxiety, but we should
    remember that the evildoers will always find ways to sow discord.

    book will show you how to use JavaScript to interface with a web browser. This
    will greatly open up the possibilities of the language, allowing you to write

    besides JavaScript, and you’ll see how to dynamically modify the contents and
    appearance of web pages using the DOM and JavaScript ([Chapter 7](chapter7.xhtml)).
    Next, you’ll practice writing JavaScript code that responds to user-driven events
    in the browser, such as key presses and mouse clicks ([Chapter 8](chapter8.xhtml)).
    Finally, you’ll learn how to use JavaScript and the Canvas API to generate static
    and animated graphics ([Chapter 9](chapter9.xhtml)).

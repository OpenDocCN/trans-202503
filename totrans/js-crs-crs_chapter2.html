<p class="INTROTNI2">In this chapter, I’ll introduce some of the basic ingredients that make up any JavaScript program. You’ll learn about the fundamental units of JavaScript code that allow you to represent values and give instructions to the computer. You’ll also learn how to assign a name to a value so you can refer to it later in your code.</p>
<p class="TX">This chapter also shows how JavaScript categorizes values into different data types based on the kind of information a value can represent. We’ll focus on primitive data types that represent individual values, such as a single number or a single piece of text. You’ll practice working with different primitive data types in the JavaScript console and explore some of the operations you can apply to them.</p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec1"><span id="h1-8"/><span aria-label=" Page 10. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_10" role="doc-pagebreak"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Expressions and Statements</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI1">The most basic building block in JavaScript is the <i>expression</i>, a fragment of code that represents a single value. The act of determining the value of an expression is known as <i>evaluation</i>. For example, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">100 + 200</span> is an expression that evaluates to the number 300.</p>
<p class="TX">Another important JavaScript building block is the <i>statement</i>, which is a complete thought, like a sentence in English, instructing the computer to do something. Every JavaScript program consists of a series of statements. In <a href="chapter1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, for example, we used the statement <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">alert("Hello, world!");</span> to instruct the computer to display a dialog with the text <i>Hello, world!</i> in it. Whereas a sentence ends with a period, JavaScript statements end with a semicolon.</p>
<p class="TX">You can turn an expression into a statement simply by adding a semicolon to the end of it. For example, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">100 + 200;</span> is a statement instructing the computer to add two numbers together. Open up the JavaScript console and enter this statement. When you do this, it will evaluate the expression in the statement and print the result:</p>

<pre><code><b>100 + 200;</b>
300
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">The main expression in this statement, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">100 + 200</span>, is known as a <i>compound expression</i>, since it actually contains two smaller expressions, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">100</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">200</span>. These are examples of the simplest form of JavaScript expression, the <i>literal</i>, which is a direct representation of a fixed value in code. Specifically, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">100</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">200</span> are <i>number literals</i>, since they directly correspond to the numeric values they represent, 100 and 200. By contrast, the compound expression <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">100 + 200</span> isn’t a literal, since it doesn’t directly correspond to its value of 300. The <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">+</span> in this compound expression doesn’t represent a value at all. Rather, it’s an <i>operator</i>, a symbol used to combine or manipulate expressions.</p>
<p class="TX">It’s important to distinguish between values, which are the underlying pieces of data in a program, and expressions, which are the notations in code that tell JavaScript what the values should be. Both <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">300</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">100 + 200</span> have a value of 300, but they’re two different expressions—one literal, one compound—that provide different ways of representing that value.</p>
<p class="TX">JavaScript expressions and statements complement each other. Expressions have values, but an expression by itself doesn’t actually <i>do</i> anything. Conversely, statements do work by telling the computer to perform tasks, but statements themselves don’t have values; they’re just instructions. The power of programming comes from writing statements that use and manipulate the values of expressions to achieve the desired outcomes.</p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec2"><span id="h1-9"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Numbers and Operators</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI1">JavaScript uses the <i>number</i> data type to store numeric values. You already started working with numbers in the previous section, where you also met the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">+</span> operator, which adds two numbers together. JavaScript has operators <span aria-label=" Page 11. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_11" role="doc-pagebreak"/>for other common mathematical calculations, too, including subtraction (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">-</span>), multiplication (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">*</span>), and division (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">/</span>). Try them out in the JavaScript console:</p>

<pre><code><b>100 + 200;</b>
300
<b>10000 - 999;</b>
9001
<b>999 * 111;</b>
110889
<b>997002 / 999;</b>
998
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">In cases like this, where the expression involves an operator (such as <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">+</span> or <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">*</span>), we often say the operator <i>returns</i> a value (rather than saying an expression is being <i>evaluated</i>). For instance, the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">*</span> operator takes in the numbers <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">999</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">111</span> and returns their product, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">110889</span>.</p>

<h4 class="H2" id="sec3"><span id="h2-1"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Order of Operations</samp></h4>
<p class="TNI1">You can combine multiple numbers and operators in a single expression, in which case you need to think about the order in which the operations will be performed. Consider this example:</p>

<pre><code><b>5 + 10 / 10 - 5;</b>
1
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">When you have multiple operators like this, JavaScript uses the standard mathematical PEMDAS (parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction) rule to determine the order of calculations. The division operation in this expression takes place first, followed by the addition and subtraction, yielding a value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">To force the addition and subtraction to happen first, use parentheses:</p>

<pre><code><b>(5 + 10) / (10 – 5);</b>
3
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">This time, the expression produces a different value, since the parentheses changed the order of operations.</p>

<h4 class="H2" id="sec4"><span id="h2-2"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Floating Point</samp></h4>
<p class="TNI1">So far we’ve limited ourselves to whole numbers, but JavaScript’s number data type also accommodates fractional numbers, called <i>floating-point numbers</i> in programming terms. Here’s an expression that produces a floating-point number:</p>

<pre><code><b>10 / 4;</b>
2.5
</code></pre>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 12. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_12" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Floating-point numbers have limited precision, so the decimal component can’t go on forever. Instead, they’re truncated, as in the following example:</p>

<pre><code><b>10 / 3;</b>
3.3333333333333335
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">You may notice some weird quirks of floating-point math, where the answer isn’t quite what you’d expect. For example, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">0.1 + 0.2</span> doesn’t work out to exactly <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">0.3</span>. Instead, we get several extra decimal places:</p>

<pre><code><b>0.1 + 0.2;</b>
0.30000000000000004
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">This is due to the underlying mathematics of how computers represent numbers (search the web for “floating-point arithmetic” to learn more). In general, these quirks shouldn’t affect you, but they could in certain circumstances. For example, if you’re writing an application that works with monetary values, it could be a problem if $0.10 and $0.20 didn’t sum to exactly $0.30. In this case, the usual solution is to convert your monetary values to cents (or the equivalent smallest denomination) before doing any math on them. For example, the number <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">0.10</span>, representing an amount of dollars, would become <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">10</span>, representing an amount of cents.</p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec6"><span id="h1-10"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Bindings</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI1">In JavaScript, you can associate a name with a value so you can easily reference that value later in your code. This association is called a <i>binding</i>. Bindings are powerful tools because they provide a place to store the values your expressions generate. Without them, your programs would have no way of remembering the work they’ve already done.</p>
<p class="TX">One type of binding is a <i>variable</i>, which allows you to update the value associated with a particular name as needed. They’re called variables because their values can change, or vary. Another type of binding is a <i>constant</i>, where you can’t update the value associated with the name once it’s been assigned. The value remains fixed, or constant.</p>
<p class="TX">Think of a variable or constant as a box with a label (the name) that holds a single item (the value). You put a value in the box, then look it up by name when you need it again. A variable allows you to put a new value in the box, while a constant will always contain the same value.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 13. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_13" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The name of a binding is also called its <i>identifier</i>, and creating an identifier is known as <i>declaration</i>: the binding’s name is being declared. In JavaScript, a declaration is a special kind of statement that generates a new identifier. Let’s look at how to declare and work with variables and constants.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec7" epub:type="division">
<h4 class="H2" id="sec7"><span id="h2-3"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Variables</samp></h4>
<p class="TNI1">JavaScript has two keywords for declaring variables: <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">var</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">let</span>. A <i>keyword</i> is a word built into the JavaScript language that’s reserved for a particular purpose. Originally, the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">var</span> keyword was the only option available, but <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">let</span> was later added to fix some of the shortcomings of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">var</span>. Today, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">let</span> is the preferred keyword for declaring variables, so that’s what we’ll use in this book, but don’t be surprised if you encounter <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">var</span> while looking at older code.</p>
<p class="TX">Here’s an example of using <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">let</span> to declare a variable:</p>

<pre><code><b>let age;</b>
undefined
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">This <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">let</span> declaration creates a new variable called <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">age</span>. A <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">let</span> declaration doesn’t have a value, so the JavaScript console prints out the special value <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">undefined</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">Now that we’ve created a variable, let’s write an expression to give it a value:</p>

<pre><code><b>age = 35;</b>
35
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">Giving a variable a value is called <i>assignment</i>, and you use the assignment operator (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">=</span>) to do it. On the right side of the operator, you enter an expression (in this case, the number literal <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">35</span>), and on the left, you enter the name of the variable that should be assigned the value of that expression (in this case, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">age</span>).</p>
<p class="TX">An assignment using the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">=</span> operator is a compound expression, just like expressions using <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">+</span> and other mathematical operators. The value of an assignment expression is the new value of the variable. In this case, we’ve set <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">age</span> to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">35</span>, so the console prints <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">35</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">Assigning a value to a variable for the first time is called <i>initialization</i>. Programmers usually combine the declaration and initialization of a variable into a single line of code. For example, here we create a new variable called <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">cats</span> and assign it the value <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">2</span>, all in the same statement:</p>

<pre><code><b>let cats = 2;</b>
undefined
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">Even though we’re assigning the variable a value here, the prevailing rule is that the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">let</span> declaration itself has no value, so the JavaScript console prints <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">undefined</span>.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 14. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_14" role="doc-pagebreak"/>To confirm the assignment worked, enter just the variable name into the console, followed by a semicolon:</p>

<pre><code><b>cats;</b>
2
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">Here, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">cats</span> is an expression that evaluates to the current value of the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">cats</span> variable, so the console prints that value.</p>
<p class="TX">Because <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">cats</span> is a variable, we’re free to change its value using new assignment expressions. Here, for example, we update its value to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">3</span>:</p>

<pre><code><b>cats = 3;</b>
3
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">The nice thing about variables is that you can change their values whenever you need—for example, when you get another cat.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="sec8" epub:type="division">
<h4 class="H2" id="sec8"><span id="h2-4"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Constants</samp></h4>
<p class="TNI1">To declare a constant in JavaScript, we use the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">const</span> keyword:</p>

<pre><code><b>const PI = 3.141592653589793;</b>
undefined
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">This creates a new constant called <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">PI</span> and assigns it the value <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">3.141592653589793</span>, which is the approximate value of the number <span class="greek"><span lang="el" xml:lang="el">π</span></span>.</p>
<p class="TX">Now we can use that constant to determine the circumference of a circle based on its diameter:</p>

<pre><code><b>let diameter = 3;</b>
undefined
<b>let circumference = diameter * PI;</b>
undefined
<b>circumference;</b>
9.42477796076938
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">Here we create a variable called <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">diameter</span> and assign it the value <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">3</span>. Then we create another variable, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">circumference</span>, and assign it a value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">diameter * PI</span>. Notice that we’re using a compound expression consisting of a variable (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">diameter</span>), a constant (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">PI</span>), and a math operation (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">*</span>) to set the value of a variable. A lot of programming boils down to creating constants and variables, and then manipulating them to create other constants and variables.</p>

<p class="TX">Unlike with variables, you can’t change the value of a constant once it’s been created. For example, if you try to update the value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">PI</span>, JavaScript gives an error:</p>

<pre><code><span aria-label=" Page 15. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_15" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>PI = 5.378;</b>

<p class="TX">Also unlike with variables, where you can separate the declaration from the initialization, you have to give a constant its value in its declaration. As a result, this won’t work:</p>

<p class="BodyContinued">This error message tells us that the constant declaration is missing its initializer, meaning the constant should have been given a value.</p>

<h4 class="H2" id="sec9"><span id="h2-5"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Naming Conventions</samp></h4>
<p class="TNI1">You should give variables and constants descriptive names, so when you or somebody else is reading your code, it’s clear what your variables and constants represent. For example, if you’re writing code to control a car, you might want a variable that stores the speed of the car in miles per hour. The name <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">speedInMilesPerHour</span> is a bit too long, but given that MPH is a commonly understood abbreviation for miles per hour, a good variable name would be <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">speedInMPH</span>. A shorter name like <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">speed</span> might be okay, but only if it’s obvious to everyone reading your code that speed is always in miles per hour. (Imagine if someone from Germany were reading your code and thought you were talking about kilometers per hour.) A bad name for this variable would be <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">s</span>, which tells the reader nothing.</p>
<p class="TX">JavaScript is case sensitive, which means it distinguishes between the variables <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">age</span>, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Age</span>, and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">AGE</span>. Also, identifiers can’t contain spaces. To work around that, a common convention for variable names is to use <i>camelCase</i>, where the first word in the name starts with a lowercase letter and each subsequent word starts with a capital letter, as in <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">speedInMilesPerHour</span>. (It’s called camelCase because the capital letter in the middle looks like the hump of a camel.)</p>
<p class="TX">An alternative naming convention for variables is <i>snake_case</i>, where everything is lowercase and each word is separated by an underscore. (I guess this looks a bit like a snake if you squint.) In snake_case, we would write <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">speed_in_miles_per_hour</span> or <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">speed_in_MPH</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">Using snake_case can make variable names slightly clearer than camelCase, but it also makes them longer and harder to type quickly. JavaScript programmers tend to prefer camelCase, so that’s what I’ll use in this book.</p>
<p class="TX">Constants follow a separate naming convention from variables. There are two types of constants: <i>true constants</i>, which have values that will never change whenever you run the program (such as pi or the number of hours <span aria-label=" Page 16. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_16" role="doc-pagebreak"/>in a day), and values you’ve made constants because you don’t want to accidentally change them in your code (such as the current user’s name). For true constants, it’s customary to use all-caps snake_case, like <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">HOURS_IN_A_DAY</span>. For constants you’ve created to avoid accidentally changing a value, use the same convention as for variables. In that case, the only difference is that the binding has been created using <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">const</span> rather than <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">let</span>.</p>

<p class="TNI1">When you’re writing software, you’ll often have to <i>increment</i> (increase) or <i>decrement</i> (decrease) the value of a variable by 1 or some other number. For example, you might use a variable to count the occurrences of a word in a document. Every time you see that word, you would increase the value of the variable by 1. Likewise, you might use a variable to keep track of how much money a player has in a game, increasing or decreasing it whenever the player earns or spends some.</p>
<p class="TX">One way to increment a variable is to initialize it, then change its value to itself plus 1:</p>

<pre><code><b>let money = 100;</b>
<b>money = money +</b><b> 1;</b>
101
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">Here we declare a new variable called <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">money</span> and initialize it with the value <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">100</span>. We then assign a new value to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">money</span> by adding 1 to its existing value. It may seem paradoxical to see an expression like <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">money = money + 1;</span>, but this is actually quite a normal programming pattern. When JavaScript encounters an assignment expression like this, it first calculates the value of the expression on the right of the assignment operator, which in this case is <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">money + 1</span>. Because <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">money</span> is currently <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">100</span>, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">money + 1</span> has a value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">101</span>. JavaScript then <span aria-label=" Page 17. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_17" role="doc-pagebreak"/>updates the value of the variable on the left side of the assignment operator, which in this case is the same variable, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">money</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">The key here is that JavaScript waits to change the value of the variable on the left of the operator until after it’s calculated the value of the expression on the right of the operator. This is how the same variable can appear on both sides of the operator. In the end, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">money = money + 1</span> means “add <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1</span> to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">money</span>.”</p>
<p class="TX">Because adding 1 to a variable is a very common task, JavaScript makes it easier with the increment operator (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">++</span>). When you attach this operator to a variable, it increases the value of that variable by 1, without you having to write out a full assignment expression. Similarly, JavaScript’s decrement operator (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">--</span>) decreases the value of a variable by 1. Here, we use <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">++</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">--</span> to change the value of a <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">temperature</span> variable:</p>

<pre><code><b>let temperature = 70;</b>
<b>++temperature;</b>
71
<b>++temperature;</b>
72
<b>--temperature;</b>
71
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">In this example, we’ve placed the increment and decrement operators <i>before</i> the variable we want to change. With the operators in this position, the output of the increment or decrement operation is the variable’s updated value. For example, when <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">temperature</span> has a value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">70</span>, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">++temperature</span> outputs a value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">71</span>. This is called <i>prefix</i> incrementing and decrementing.</p>
<p class="TX">JavaScript also allows for <i>postfix</i> incrementing and decrementing, where the operator goes <i>after</i> the variable. In this case, the variable still increases or decreases by 1, but the value shown in the output is the variable’s value <i>before</i> it was changed. Here’s an example:</p>

<pre><code><b>let books = 2;</b>
<b>books</b><b>++;</b>
<span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❶</span> 2
<b>books;</b>
<span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">❷</span> 3
<b>books--;</b>
3
<b>books;</b>
2
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">We initialize the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">books</span> variable with the value <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">2</span>. Then <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">books++</span> increments that value, but it returns the value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">books</span> from <i>before</i> it was incremented <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationCode">❶</span>. When we then ask for the value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">books</span> on its own, we can see that it has the new value <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationCode">❷</span>, confirming that the increment operation took place.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 18. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_18" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Whether you use prefix or postfix incrementing and decrementing, the effect on the variable is the same: its value increases or decreases by 1. The only difference is how the incrementing or decrementing expression itself evaluates. Luckily, most of the time when you use one of these operators, you won’t actually need the value of the incrementing or decrementing expression itself—you’ll just be modifying the value saved in the variable. Therefore, you can usually use the prefix and postfix versions interchangeably.</p>

<p class="TNI1">The increment operator increases a variable’s value by 1, but sometimes you’ll want to increase it by a different amount. For that, JavaScript has the addition assignment operator (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">+=</span>). It increases the value of the variable on the left side of the operator by whatever value you place to the right of the operator, as shown here:</p>

<pre><code><b>let price = 20;</b>
<b>price </b><b>+= 5;</b>
25
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">Here we use <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">+=</span> to increase the value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">price</span> by <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">5</span>. Essentially, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">price += 5</span> is shorthand for <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">price = price + 5</span>. The <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">+=</span> operator combines addition and assignment into one symbol.</p>
<p class="TX">Similarly, the subtraction assignment operator (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">-=</span>) is a convenient way to subtract any value from a variable:</p>

<pre><code><b>let cookies = 12;</b>
<b>cookies -= 5;</b>
7
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">In this case, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">cookies -= 5</span> is shorthand for <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">cookies = cookies - 5</span>.</p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec15"><span id="h1-12"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Strings</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI1">JavaScript uses the <i>string</i> data type to represent text. It’s called a string because the text is treated as a sequence, or string, of characters. For example, the string <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Hello!</span> consists of six characters: <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">H</span>, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">e</span>, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">l</span>, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">l</span>, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">o</span>, and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">A <i>string literal</i> is a direct representation of a string value. To create a string literal, simply surround some text with double quotation marks. Every character between the quotes is part of the string. For example, here we assign the string literal <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">"Hello!"</span> as the value of the variable <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">greeting</span>. Then we check the value of the variable:</p>

<pre><code><b>let greeting = "Hello!";</b>
<b>greeting;</b>
'Hello!'
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">You can also write string literals inside single quotation marks rather than double quotation marks. In fact, as shown in this example, when Chrome’s JavaScript console outputs a string, it encloses the string in single quotes (even if you wrote it with double quotes). For consistency, I’ll stick with double quotes when I’m writing strings throughout this book, although I’ll also use single quotes to accurately reflect the output of the console.</p>
<p class="TX">Typically, strings mostly consist of letters, but as our <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">"Hello!"</span> example indicated, they can also include punctuation. Strings can contain spaces, too, as well as numerals, as in this example:</p>

<pre><code><b>let price = "5 dollars";</b>
<b>price;</b>
'5 dollars'
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">It’s even possible to have a string that just contains numerals, such as <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">"123"</span>, but it’s important to distinguish this string from an actual number. The string literal <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">"123"</span> is a sequence of three characters, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1</span>, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">2</span>, and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">3</span>, while the number literal <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">123</span> has a numerical value of 123.</p>
<p class="TX">JavaScript provides a lot of ways to manipulate strings. We’ll look at some of these string operations next.</p>

<p class="TNI1">When applied to strings rather than numbers, the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">+</span> operator joins the strings together. This way, you can build up a longer message by combining various strings. Here’s an example:</p>

<pre><code><b>let first = "First string";</b>
<b>let second = "Second string";</b>
<b>let joined = first +</b><b> second;</b>
<b>joined;</b>
'First stringSecond string'
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">Here we assign two strings to the variables <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">first</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">second</span>. Then we use <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">+</span> to join the strings, storing the result in the variable <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">joined</span>. Notice that JavaScript doesn’t add a space between the strings being joined—it just tacks the second string directly onto the end of the first. If you want a space in between, you have to add it explicitly by treating the space as its own string:</p>

<pre><code><b>first + " " + second;</b>
'First string Second string'
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">In this example, we join three string literals:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="NL">  1.  <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">"First string"</span></p>
<p class="NL">  2.  <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">" "</span> (a string consisting of a single space)</p>
<p class="NL">  3.  <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">"Second string"</span></p>
</div>
<p class="BodyContinued">As a result, we get a space between <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">string</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Second</span>.</p>

<p class="TNI1">To get a sequence of multiple characters (also called a <i>slice</i>) from a string, rather than just a single character, use the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">slice</span> method. A <i>method</i> is a specific kind of function that’s attached to a particular value or data type. (As we discussed in <a href="chapter1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, a function is a named piece of code that carries out a task.) Methods are generally used to make a calculation about the thing they’re attached to, or to update something about it. In this case, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">slice</span> is one of many methods associated with the string data type that you can use to manipulate a given string.</p>
<p class="TX">The syntax for using, or <i>calling</i>, a method is to follow the value or variable you want to apply the method to with a period, then the name of the method, and then a set of parentheses. Inside the parentheses, you write any values that the method needs to do its job, separated by commas. As with other functions, these values are known as <i>arguments</i>. Methods can also produce a value, known as the method’s <i>return value</i>.</p>
<p class="TX">The <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">slice</span> method takes two arguments, the start index (inclusive) and end index (exclusive) of the slice you want to extract, and returns <span aria-label=" Page 22. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_22" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the substring containing the specified range of characters. Here’s an example:</p>

<pre><code><b>let sentence = "My name is Nick.";</b>
<b>sentence.slice(3, 7);</b>
'name'
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">Here, we store a string in the variable <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">sentence</span> and then call the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">slice</span> method on that string by writing <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">sentence.slice(3, 7)</span>. The first argument in the parentheses means we want the slice to start at index <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">3</span> of the string (the fourth character, the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">n</span> in <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">name</span>). The second argument means we want the slice to go up to, but not include, index <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">7</span> of the string (the space after <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">name</span>).

<h3 class="H1" id="sec15a"><span id="h1-13"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Escape Sequences</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI1">Sometimes you’ll want to put special characters into your strings, like newline characters to create a line break in the middle of the string, or tab characters to create wider horizontal spacing. JavaScript lets you include these using <i>escape sequences</i>. An escape sequence is a series of characters, always starting with a backslash (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">\</span>), that gets converted to another character. For example, to insert a newline character into a string, use the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">\n</span> escape sequence:</p>

<pre><code><b>"Hello\nWorld";</b>
'Hello\nWorld'
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">For better or worse, when Chrome’s JavaScript console evaluates a string with a special character and outputs the result, the special character remains in its escaped form. To see how the string appears with the escape sequence interpreted correctly, pass the string as an argument to the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">console.log</span> method. This method prints data to the console, including any necessary formatting. For example:</p>

<pre><code><b>console.log("Hello\nWorld");</b>
Hello
World
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">The output of this method shows how the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">\n</span> escape sequence is interpreted as a line break between the two words in the string.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 24. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_24" role="doc-pagebreak"/><a href="chapter2.xhtml#tab2-1">Table 2-1</a> lists some of the escape sequences you’ll use most often.</p>

<p class="TX">As the table indicates, if you want to include an actual backslash character in your string, you’ll need to use <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">\\</span>. Similarly, if you want to include a double quote character in your double-quoted string, you’ll need to use <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">\"</span>. For example:</p>

<pre><code><b>console.log("This string has \"double quotes\" and a \\ backslash character");</b>
This string has "double quotes" and a \ backslash character
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">When you write a string inside double quotes, there’s no need to use the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">\'</span> escape sequence when you want a single quote, for example, as an apostrophe in a contraction. You can just write the single quote directly, as shown here:</p>

<pre><code><b>console.log("You don't need to escape single quotes");</b>
You don't need to escape single quotes
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">Similarly, when you write a string inside single quotes, there’s no need to escape double quotes.</p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec25"><span id="h1-14"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Template Literals</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI1">A <i>template literal</i> is a special kind of string that can evaluate any expressions embedded within it. This gives you the flexibility to dynamically populate a string with the values of variables, the results of calculations, or other code, instead of having to type out every character of the string exactly or combine several variables into a string with the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">+</span> operator.</p>
<p class="TX">Template literals are enclosed in backticks (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">`</span>) instead of quotation marks. You incorporate code using <i>placeholder syntax</i>, which looks like this: <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">${}</span>. The <span aria-label=" Page 25. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_25" role="doc-pagebreak"/>text inside the braces of the placeholder is treated as an expression and is evaluated before the final string is evaluated, as shown here:</p>

<pre><code><b>let name </b><b>= "Nick";</b>
<b>`Hello, ${name}!`;</b>
'Hello, Nick!'
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">Here, the value of the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">name</span> variable gets inserted into the string instead of the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">${name}</span> placeholder, resulting in the string <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">"Hello Nick!"</span> If we change the value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">name</span>, the same template literal will produce a different string:</p>

<pre><code><b>name = "Dolly";</b>
<b>`Hello, ${name}!`;</b>
'Hello, Dolly!'
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">You can place any expression in the placeholder braces, not just a simple variable. The expression will be evaluated, and the result will be inserted into the string. For example:</p>

<pre><code><b>`There are ${60 * 60 * 24} seconds in a day`;</b>
'There are 86400 seconds in a day'
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">In this case, JavaScript calculates the value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">60 * 60 * 24</span>, converts it to a string, and incorporates it into the evaluated string.</p>
<p class="TX">Template literals have many applications, such as taking text input from a user and inserting it into a new string. They’re especially useful when you need to make a string based on several variables. For example, say you’re building a Mad Libs–type web application that takes in words of different parts of speech and combines them into sentences. The user has input the following three words, which you’ve stored in separate variables:</p>

<pre><code><b>let noun = "moon";</b>
<b>let adverb = "strangely";</b>
<b>let adjective = "red";</b>
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">Without template literals, you’d have to combine the variables into a string by repeatedly using the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">+</span> operator:</p>

<pre><code><b>"The " + noun </b><b>+ " was " + adverb + " " + adjective + ".";</b>
'The moon was strangely red.'
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">This code is pretty tedious to write, especially as you want to include a space between each word and a period at the end of the sentence. It’s much simpler to use a template literal:</p>

<pre><code><b>`The ${noun} was ${adverb} ${adjective}.`;</b>
'The moon was strangely red.'
</code></pre>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 26. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_26" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In addition to making code easier to write, template literals also make it easier to read. It’s much more apparent that this code is inserting a custom noun, adverb, and adjective into a sentence.</p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec26"><span id="h1-15"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Undefined and Null</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI1">In JavaScript, the values <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">undefined</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">null</span> have a special meaning: they represent <i>nothing</i>. When JavaScript doesn’t have a value for something, it returns <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">undefined</span> by default. For example, as you saw earlier in this chapter, if you create a variable without giving it a value, JavaScript automatically assigns that variable a value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">undefined</span>:</p>

<pre><code><b>let nothing;</b>
<b>nothing;</b>
undefined
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">You also get <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">undefined</span> when you execute a function that has no useful value to return in the console, such as the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">alert</span> function we used in <a href="chapter1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> to pop up a dialog in the browser:</p>

<pre><code><b>alert("I have no value.");</b>
undefined 
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">Whereas JavaScript automatically uses <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">undefined</span> when something has no value, programmers generally use <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">null</span> to explicitly mark something as empty. For example, if you’re writing some code that takes an address as user input, and the user doesn’t supply their address, you can set the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">address</span> variable to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">null</span> instead:</p>

<pre><code><b>let address = null;</b>
<b>address;</b>
null
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">Functionally speaking, setting <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">address</span> to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">null</span> isn’t really any different from leaving the variable <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">undefined</span>, but it makes your intentions clearer. Someone else reading your code will see that you’re deliberately marking <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">address</span> as an empty value, as opposed to it just not having been defined yet.</p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec27"><span id="h1-16"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Booleans</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI1">The last primitive data type we’ll consider is the <i>Boolean</i> type, which represents true/false values. There are only two Boolean literals: <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span>. Here we create a Boolean variable using a literal and confirm its value:</p>

<pre><code><b>let playing = true;</b>
<b>playing;</b>
true
</code></pre>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 27. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_27" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In this example, we’re declaring a new variable called <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">playing</span> and initializing it with the Boolean literal <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span>. You can imagine that this is some code in a game, and that the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">playing</span> variable tells us if the game is currently active (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span>) or paused (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span>).</p>
<p class="TX">Booleans are an essential part of programming because they give us a way to talk about logic. If you want your program to behave differently for a particular condition, you need to be able to say whether or not that condition holds—that is, whether it’s true or false. For example, if you’re working on a video streaming website, you might need to know if the current user is under 18. If they are, you might hide certain content. You’d use a Boolean in this case to decide whether or not to hide the content.</p>
<p class="TX">Booleans have various operators associated with them. They fall into two groups: <i>logical operators</i>, which take Boolean values and return Boolean values, and <i>comparison operators</i>, which can take values of other types, such as numbers and strings, and return Boolean values.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec28" epub:type="division">
<h4 class="H2" id="sec28"><span id="h2-14"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Logical Operators</samp></h4>
<p class="TNI1">There are three Boolean logical operators: <i>and</i>, <i>or</i>, and <i>not</i>. The and operator (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;&amp;</span>) takes two values, known as <i>operands</i>, and returns <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span> only if both operands are <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span>. This is useful for any case where you need two conditions to be true for something to happen. Let’s continue the game example, and pretend we’re writing the logic for a platform game. In this game, you can shoot fireballs, but only if you have a powerup <i>and</i> you’re jumping. Here’s how to express that in code:</p>

<pre><code><b>let powerup </b><b>= true;</b>
<b>let jumping = true;</b>
<b>powerup &amp;&amp; jumping;</b>
true
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">In this case, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">powerup</span> is <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">jumping</span> is <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span>, so <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">powerup &amp;&amp; jumping</span> is also <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span>. If you set either (or both) of those variables to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span>, however, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">powerup &amp;&amp; jumping</span> will also be <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span>:</p>

<pre><code><b>jumping = false;</b>
<b>powerup &amp;&amp; jumping;</b>
false
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">The or operator (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">||</span>) returns <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span> if <i>either</i> of its operands is <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span>. This is useful if only one of several conditions needs to be true for something to happen. In our game, for example, let’s say you die if a fireball hits you <i>or</i> if you touch a monster:</p>

<pre><code><b>let hitByFireball = false;</b>
<b>let touchedMonster = true;</b>
<b>hitByFireball || touchedMonster;</b>
true
</code></pre>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 28. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_28" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Because one of the two operands is <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span>, the expression <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">hitByFireball || touchedMonster</span> is <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span>. The <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">||</span> operator will also return <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span> if both operands are <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">The not operator (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!</span>) takes only one operand and returns the inverse of its value, so <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!true</span> is <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!false</span> is <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span>. This is particularly useful if you want something to happen when a condition is <i>not</i> true. In our game, for example, we might have a variable called <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">alive</span> that tells us if the player is currently alive. The game should end when the player is dead—that is, when <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!alive</span> is <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span> (meaning <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">alive</span> itself is <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span>):</p>

<pre><code><b>let alive = false;</b>
<b>!alive;</b>
true
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">Different logical operators are often combined to form more sophisticated logical expressions. For example, let’s say you can jump in our game only when you’re not carrying a box and you’re not swimming. In that case, we’d use two Boolean variables to represent carrying a box and swimming, use <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!</span> to invert each of those variables, and use <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;&amp;</span> to check the two inverted variables together, like so:</p>

<pre><code><b>let carryingBox = true;</b>
<b>let swimming = false;</b>
<b>!carryingBox &amp;&amp; !swimming;</b>
false
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">You aren’t swimming, but you <i>are</i> carrying a box, so the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;&amp;</span> operator returns <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span>, meaning you can’t jump.</p>
<p class="TX">It can sometimes be hard to read more complex logical expressions, so let’s go through the steps JavaScript takes when evaluating the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!carryingBox &amp;&amp; !swimming</span> expression. First, to simplify things, replace the variable names with the Boolean values they’re currently set to:</p>

<pre><code>!true &amp;&amp; !false</code></pre>
<p class="TX">Next, replace the expressions <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!true</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!false</span> with their equivalent values, removing the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!</span> operators:</p>

<pre><code>false &amp;&amp; true</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">Now we just have to remember that <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;&amp;</span> returns <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span> only if both its operands are <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span>. In this case, one of the operands is <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span>, so we know that this expression evaluates to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">There’s a useful trick for working with Boolean expressions like this. The expression <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!a &amp;&amp; !b</span> can be rewritten as <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!(a || b)</span>. Think of this as rewording the original description from “not carrying a box <i>and</i> not swimming” to “not (carrying a box <i>or</i> swimming).” This trick is called De Morgan’s law (no relation!). It can also be used to convert <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!a || !b</span> to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!(a &amp;&amp; b)</span>.</p>

<p class="TNI1">JavaScript’s comparison operators compare values and return a Boolean value based on the result of the comparison. For example, the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">===</span> or “triple equals” operator checks if two values are equal. It returns <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span> if they are, or <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span> if they aren’t. Here are some examples of the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">===</span> operator in action:</p>

<pre><code><b>5 === 5;</b>
true
<b>6 ===</b><b> 7;</b>
false
<b>2 + 2 === 4;</b>
true
<b>"hello" === "goodbye";</b>
false
<b>"hello" === "hel" + "lo";</b>
true
<b>false ===</b><b> false;</b>
true
<b>true === false;</b>
false
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">Notice that <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">===</span> isn’t just for comparing number literals; it can also work with numerical expressions like <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">2 + 2</span>, string literals (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">"hello"</span>), string expressions (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">"hel" + "lo"</span>), and Booleans. It can compare values stored in variables as well:</p>

<pre><code><b>let answer = 2 + 2;</b>
<b>answer === 5;</b>

<p class="BodyContinued">Here <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">answer</span> is set to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">4</span>, the value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">2 + 2</span>, so the comparison with <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">5</span> is <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">The opposite of the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">===</span> operator is <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!==</span> (the first <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">=</span> is replaced by a <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!</span>). This operator checks if two values are <i>not</i> equal. For example:</p>

<pre><code><b>8 !== 8;</b>
false
<b>"apples" !== "oranges";</b>
true
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">Using the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!==</span> operator is the same as using the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">===</span> operator, then applying the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!</span> operator to the result:</p>

<pre><code><b>!(8 === 8);</b>
false
<b>!("apples" === "oranges");</b>
true
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">JavaScript’s other comparison operators check if one value is greater than or less than another. These include the standard mathematical operations of <span aria-label=" Page 30. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_30" role="doc-pagebreak"/>greater than (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&gt;</span>), less than (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;</span>), greater than or equal to (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&gt;=</span>), and less than or equal to (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;=</span>). Consider these examples:</p>

<pre><code><b>1 &gt; -1;</b>
true
<b>10 &gt; 10;</b>
false
<b>10 &gt;= 10;</b>
true
<b>-1 &lt; 1;</b>
true
<b>10 &lt; 10;</b>
false
<b>10 &lt;= 10;</b>
true
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">Notice in particular that comparing identical values with <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&gt;</span> or <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;</span> returns <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span>, but comparing them with <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&gt;=</span> or <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;=</span> returns <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">These comparison operators can also be used with strings. One string is considered “greater than” another string if it would appear later in a dictionary. For example:</p>

<pre><code><b>"cat" &lt; "dog";</b>
true
<b>"abc" &gt; "abbcdef";</b>
true
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">The first comparison evaluates to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span> because the first letter of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">cat</span> comes before the first letter of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">dog</span> in the alphabet. In the second comparison, the first two characters of the strings are the same, but looking at the third character, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">c</span> is later in the alphabet than <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">b</span>, so the first string is considered greater. It doesn’t matter that the second string is longer; JavaScript compares the strings character by character and stops the comparison as soon as it’s found a difference.</p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec30"><span id="h1-17"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Type Coercion</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI1"><i>Coercion</i> is the act of automatically converting a value of one data type into a value of a different data type. JavaScript uses coercion in certain circumstances where values of different data types appear in the same expression. For example, if you use the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">+</span> operator with a string on one side and a number on the other, JavaScript coerces the number to a string, then joins the two strings together:</p>

<pre><code><b>"Current score: " + 10;</b>
"Current score: 10" 
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued"><span aria-label=" Page 31. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_31" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Notice that <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">10</span> appears inside the quotes in the output, meaning it’s become a string rather than a number. This kind of coercion makes it quite easy to incorporate numbers into strings for display to a user.</p>
<p class="TX">In some contexts, Boolean values are coerced into numbers, with <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span> becoming <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">0</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span> becoming <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1</span>. For example:</p>

<pre><code><b>100 + true;</b>
101
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">Here we’ve used the Boolean literal <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span> with a number in a mathematical expression, so JavaScript coerces it to a <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1</span>, then adds <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">100</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1</span> to produce <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">101</span>.</p>

<p class="TNI1">Earlier we used the triple equals operator (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">===</span>) to check for equality. There’s another operator, double equals (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">==</span>), that applies coercion to its operands before checking for equality. For example, if you compare a number to a Boolean using <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">==</span>, the Boolean will first be coerced into a number:</p>

<pre><code><b>0 == false;</b>
true
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">This comparison is <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span> because the Boolean <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span> is first coerced to a <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">0</span>. If you make the same comparison using the triple equals operator, however, it will be <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span>, since <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">===</span> doesn’t permit type coercion:</p>

<pre><code><b>0 ===</b><b> false;</b>
false
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">It can be hard to guess what will be coerced to what when you use the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">==</span> operator. Here are some other examples:</p>

<pre><code><b>"1" == 1;</b>
true
<b>undefined == null;</b>
true
<b>undefined == false;</b>
false
<b>"" == 0;</b>
true
<b>"" == false;</b>
true
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">When you compare a number with a string consisting of all numerals, such as <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">"1"</span>, the string is coerced to the equivalent number, so <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">"1" == 1</span> becomes <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1 == 1</span>, which evaluates to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span>. The <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">==</span> operator also returns <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span> when <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">undefined</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">null</span> are compared to each other, but it returns <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span> if <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">undefined</span> or <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">null</span> is compared to anything else. Meanwhile, an <i>empty string</i>—that is, a string that contains no characters, represented by a set <span aria-label=" Page 32. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_32" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of quotation marks with nothing in between (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">""</span>)—is considered equivalent to the number <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">0</span> and the Boolean <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">The opposite of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">==</span> is the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!=</span> operator.

Some inequalities that are <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span> using the strict <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!==</span> operator become <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span> with the coercive <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!=</span> operator. For example:</p>

<pre><code><b>0 !</b><b>== false;</b>

<b>0 != false;</b>
false

<p class="BodyContinued">Without coercion, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">0</span> is not equal to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span>, so <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">0 !== false</span> is <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span>.

You’ll be less likely to encounter unexpected behavior in your code.</p>

<h4 class="H2" id="sec32"><span id="h2-17"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Truthiness</samp></h4>
<p class="TNI1"><i>Truthiness</i> is a special type of coercion that defines how non-Boolean values are treated as Booleans. This allows logical operators like <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;&amp;</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!</span> to be used on any type of value. The way the operators work depends on whether JavaScript considers the value to be <i>truthy</i> (equivalent to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span>) or <i>falsy</i> (equivalent to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span>). The falsy values include <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">undefined</span>, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">null</span>, the number <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">0</span>, and an empty string (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">""</span>). All nonzero numbers and nonempty strings are truthy.</p>
<p class="TX">The easiest way to check if a value is truthy or falsy is to apply two not operations to it using <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!!</span>, meaning “not not,” a double negative. This works because the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!</span> operator always returns a Boolean, regardless of the data type of the value it’s applied to. For example, say you want to verify that the number <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">0</span> is falsy. A single <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!</span> operation coerces the number to a Boolean, then inverts that Boolean, so <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!0</span> evaluates to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span>:</p>

<pre><code><b>!0;</b>
true
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">Adding a second <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!</span> reverses the Boolean again, giving the Boolean equivalent of the original value:</p>

<pre><code><b>!!0;</b>
false
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">This confirms that <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">0</span> is equivalent to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span>, or falsy.</p>
<p class="TX">You can use the same <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!!</span> trick to check the other truthiness rules I mentioned earlier:</p>

<pre><code><b>!!1;</b>
true
<b>!!"hi";</b>
true
<span aria-label=" Page 33. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_33" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>!!"";</b>
false
<b>!!undefined</b>
false
<b>!!null;</b>
false
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">The output confirms that nonzero numbers and nonempty strings are truthy, while an empty string, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">undefined</span>, and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">null</span> are falsy.</p>
<p class="TX">When the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;&amp;</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">||</span> operators are applied to non-Booleans, they don’t return a <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span> or <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span> value. Instead, they return one of the original operands. In the case of the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;&amp;</span> operator, if the first operand is truthy, the second operand is returned. If the first operand is falsy, the first operand is returned. Here are some examples:</p>

<pre><code><b>15 &amp;&amp; 17;</b>
17
<b>0 &amp;&amp; 20;</b>
0
<b>undefined &amp;&amp; null;</b>
undefined
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">In the first case, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">15</span> is truthy, so <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">17</span> is returned. In the other two cases, the first operand is falsy, so <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">0</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">undefined</span> are returned, respectively.</p>
<p class="TX">The <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">||</span> operator works the opposite way. If the first operand is falsy, it returns the second operand, and if the first operand is truthy, it returns the first operand, as shown here:</p>

<pre><code><b>"" || "hello";</b>
'hello'
<b>"hello" || "goodbye";</b>
'hello'
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">In the first case, the first operand is an empty string, which is falsy, so the second operand is returned. In the second case, the first operand is a nonempty string, which is truthy, so the first operand is returned.</p>

<h4 class="H2" id="sec33"><span id="h2-18"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Uses for Truthiness</samp></h4>
<p class="TNI1">You can leverage the behavior of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp; &amp;</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">||</span> with truthy and falsy values in a number of ways. For example, the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">||</span> operator can be used to give a variable a default value if one isn’t provided. This could be helpful in a scenario where a user neglects to enter their name on a form:</p>

<pre><code><b>let name;</b>
<b>name =</b><b> name || "No name provided";</b>
<b>name;</b>
'No name provided'
</code></pre>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 34. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_34" role="doc-pagebreak"/>At the start of this example, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">name</span> is created without being given a value, so it’s <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">undefined</span>. Then we assign it a value using the Boolean expression <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">name || "No name provided"</span>. Since the first operand is falsy, the second operand is returned. As a result, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">name</span> is given the default value <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">"No name provided"</span>. If, on the other hand, a name <i>had</i> been provided, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">name</span> would be considered truthy, and so it would retain its value:</p>

<pre><code><b>let name =</b><b> "Nick";</b>
<b>name = name || "No name provided";</b>
<b>name;</b>
'Nick'
</code></pre>
<p class="TX">Similarly, you can use <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;&amp;</span> or <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">||</span> to <i>short-circuit</i>, or skip, an expression. With <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;&amp;</span>, if the first operand is falsy, that’s the operand that will be evaluated and returned, so JavaScript doesn’t even bother evaluating the second operand. When the operands are just simple values, we don’t really care if they’re evaluated or not; all we care about is which value is returned. For example, in the expression <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1 || 2 + 2</span>, it doesn’t especially matter whether JavaScript calculates the result of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">2 + 2</span>, because we know the first operand, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1</span>, is going to be returned. It <i>does</i> matter if an expression is evaluated when that expression has some kind of <i>side effect</i>, however, meaning that evaluating it does something other than just returning a value. For example, the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">alert</span> function returns the value <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">undefined</span>, but more importantly has the side effect of displaying a dialog. But what if we want to only display a dialog in some circumstances?</p>
<p class="TX">For instance, say we want to use <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">alert</span> to display a player’s score in a game, but only when the score isn’t zero. We can make the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">score</span> variable and the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">alert</span> function the operands in an <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;&amp;</span> expression:</p>

<pre><code><b>let score = 0;</b>
<b>score &amp;&amp; alert(`Your score is ${score}!`);</b>
0
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">Here <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">score</span> is <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">0</span>, so the first operand in the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;&amp;</span> expression is falsy. The <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;&amp;</span> operator therefore returns this value and ignores the second operand, meaning <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">alert</span> is never called. We’ve short-circuited the function call.</p>
<p class="TX">Now consider what happens if <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">score</span> increases:</p>

<pre><code><b>++score;</b>
1
<b>score &amp;&amp; alert(`Your score is ${score}!`);</b>
undefined
</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">Here we use <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">++</span> to increment score, changing its value to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1</span>. This makes <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">score</span> truthy, so the second operand in the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;&amp;</span> expression is evaluated, executing the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">alert</span> function. The function returns <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">undefined</span>, but also has the (desired) side effect of displaying a dialog with the player’s score (see <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-1">Figure 2-1</a>).<span aria-label=" Page 35.

</figure>
<p class="TX">Essentially, we’re using the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;&amp;</span> operator to decide whether or not to run some code (the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">alert</span> function) based on a condition (whether or not <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">score</span> is <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">0</span>). In <a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, we’ll look at control structures like <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">if</span> statements, which give a more explicit way of controlling whether and how our code is run.</p>

<p class="TNI1">This chapter introduced you to some of the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript programming. You learned that a statement is a complete thought in JavaScript, ending with a semicolon, that instructs the computer to do something, and that a statement can consist of one or more expressions (units of code that represent a value). You saw how to use bindings to give a value a name for later use, either as a variable, in which case the value can be updated later, or as a constant, in which case the value remains fixed.</p>
<p class="TX">You also learned about three primitive data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and Booleans. You applied math operations to numbers, including using shorthand like <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">++</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">--</span> to increment or decrement them, and you practiced manipulating strings using various methods, including slicing and trimming whitespace. With Booleans, you learned how to use logical operators like and (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;&amp;</span>), or (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">||</span>), and not (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!</span>), and you saw how to generate Boolean values using comparison operators like <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">===</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">!==</span>. Finally, you learned how JavaScript sometimes coerces values from one data type to another, including how non-Booleans are treated as truthy or falsy, and you explored situations where this can come in handy, such as to short-circuit an expression.</p>

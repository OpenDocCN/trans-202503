    paid for a horse, and so on. Without such a model, there’s no way to determine

    there existed a way to relate the value of various items in common trade, that
    system of prices would permit financial contracts and rudimentary banking to take
    place *without* coinage. Obligations and account balances, perhaps measured in
    customary units such as bushels of grain, could be agreed upon and then tracked
    within communities. And indeed, financial ledgers of this sort are known to have

    would retain the same standing for long. As confidence in the government’s fiscal
    policy wanes, it’s entirely possible that merchants would refuse to take the state-issued
    currency, demanding more stable alternatives. We know this was the reality of
    many failed states in the 20th century—especially in the Soviet Bloc, where all

    it’s plausible that not pursuing such policies might have left our ancestors objectively

    early banks didn’t play much of a role in what we now call *consumer lending*;
    instead, the vast majority of personal loans happened between people who knew
    each other in some way. This was in part because many religious doctrines and
    legal systems around the world prohibited *usury*—the collection of interest on
    loans—which was seen as an exploitative and indecent act. Of course, the rules

    To meet these obligations and to make a profit, the banks then used the pooled
    deposits to make higher-interest loans to other folks. Taking a page from the
    government’s playbook for representative currencies, the financiers figured out

    the example of Bitcoin is instructive. It’s a global, decentralized currency with
    no recoverable intrinsic value, no central authority to issue the money or set
    exchange rates, and no other mechanism anchoring it to the physical world. Until
    the publication of a technical paper by a mysterious person going by the pseudonym
    of Satoshi Nakamoto,^([7](b02.xhtml#c07-endnote-7)) such a juxtaposition of properties
    would seem nonsensical, and as such, it escaped any serious debate. But with his

    several clever computer tricks.

    of their homes, but only by solving computational puzzles that would get more

    Bitcoin, as doing so required only a modest investment of time and money, but
    offered the prospect of significant returns on the resale of these tokens as the
    difficulty of the puzzles went up (provided, of course, that public interest in
    this technology could be sustained in the long haul).

    of cryptography. Only the authorized holder of a given coin would know the secret
    key needed to transfer the asset, but anyone in the world could verify that a
    transaction had taken place. And finally, Nakamoto’s currency employed a decentralized,
    internet-based ledger—known as the *blockchain*—to record the chain of custody
    for coins in a tamper-proof way, and to rule out the possibility of the owner
    of a coin spending it twice. As long as the majority of market participants acted
    in good faith, the integrity of the blockchain was assured without the need for
    any central authority to keep track of transactions and accounts.

    the practical importance of the distributed ledger has decreased over time. With
    the influx of non-tech-savvy investors, most users of popular cryptocurrencies
    opted for centralized cloud-based services to store and manipulate the balances
    in their digital wallets, rather than trying to tinker with cryptography on their
    own computers. This emergent ecosystem is operated by a handful of large corporations,
    some with thousands of employees and valuations measured in the billions of dollars.

    except for the lower degree of regulatory oversight and the limited recourse for

    of coins as the computational complexity of “mining” operations grows, and as
    some of the previously mined tokens are lost. Over the past couple of years, this
    constraint has caused the price of Bitcoin to increase more than a hundred-fold.
    Early growth created a positive feedback loop, where new investors would be attracted
    to the astonishing returns, and would double down on the currency in hopes of
    even higher gains. This speculative gold rush might be unsustainable—especially
    given that the use of Bitcoin in bona fide trade is minimal, and that future uses
    of this sort are hindered by a range of design flaws that lead to long processing

    collapse of these instruments is imminent. In some sense, a coin that represents
    a mathematical proof of wasted electricity is no better or worse than a currency
    with pictures of dead presidents. There might be a future where we’re all using
    Bitcoin, Dogecoin, or one of the experimental “stablecoins” that are meant to

    flawed; risk has many dimensions. Cash, despite its characterization as virtually
    risk-free, is nothing of the sort. It comes with the near-certainty of gradual
    inflation that eventually wipes out all unattended funds, along with the small
    but non-negligible chance of a hyperinflationary event or deposit forfeiture.
    Real estate carries risks, too, just of a different kind. In addition to large
    events like the housing market collapse of 2007, your home can lose a lot of value
    simply if your neighbor opens a backyard hog farm. Every asset has a combination
    of “risk vectors” attached to it, pointing in different directions in a multidimensional
    space. The primary goal of a doomsday portfolio is to balance these forces so
    that no single event can wipe out the bulk of our savings. To be sure, some losses
    might be unavoidable in trying times—but there’s a fundamental difference between
    experiencing a 30 percent dip in the midst of a recession and flat out going broke.

    risky bets. There’s a place and time for that—the stock market certainly offers
    reasonable odds for the betting individual—but speculative investments should
    be limited to surplus funds you aren’t afraid to lose, ideally kept in a separate
    account. For the rainy-day fund, the only “gains” you need to make are to keep
    up with the continued depreciation of the currency that’s used to measure the
    size of the nest egg. If fortune smiles upon you and you earn more, that’s just
    a happy accident.

    in a post-apocalyptic world where all paper money somehow loses its luster. But
    this seems unlikely. Although the metals functioned in this capacity for millennia,
    this day and age, few people have even the faintest idea what a silver coin is
    worth, or how to tell if it’s real. On top of this, relatively few such coins
    are in private possession, and they aren’t distributed in any useful way. In your
    neighborhood, one person might have 1,000 Silver Eagles hidden under the floorboards,
    while 50 other households will have none. An attempt to bootstrap a silver- or
    gold-based economy could succeed, but it wouldn’t be an easy feat.

    inflation hedge, but in practice, the commodity seldom behaves this way. Of course,
    in a monetary collapse, gold is bound to hold up value much better than paper
    money, but under normal circumstances, the prices fluctuate significantly for
    reasons that are difficult to ascertain, such as the whims of speculators or the
    geopolitics of mining the metal in faraway lands. When the price of your hedge
    can move 50 percent one way or another for reasons unrelated to inflation, its
    poorly characterized volatility needs to be taken into account—and it better be
    outweighed by the instrument’s potential benefits.

    in comparison to most other assets you can hold in your hand, they’re remarkably
    liquid. Any standard bar or coin can be sold quickly, for cash, close to its spot
    price. Another undeniable plus is that similarly to paper currency, precious metals
    are private. Although some reporting requirements exist in the United States for
    larger trades, they currently apply to only very specific forms of the metal,
    such as gold bars over 32 troy ounces and 1 oz. Mexican onza coins. As for the
    proverbial gold buried in your backyard, that’s strictly between you and the squirrels
    watching from the trees. Finally, the compact size and the high value of gold
    bullion is of note. Individuals fleeing oppressive regimes can carry tens of thousands
    of dollars in life savings in their pocket, and liquidate the metal anywhere in
    the world.

    critiques of precious metals in an effort to elevate their instrument of choice.
    They charge that just like Bitcoin, gold and silver have no intrinsic value, and
    that all the value derives from the *belief* that a particular metal ought to
    be worth much. That’s a silly argument. *Intrinsic value* doesn’t mean that the
    instrument needs to be worth the same to the reptilians living on Omicron Persei
    8; it’s just that its price comes from the innate characteristics of the asset
    itself. Here on Earth, both gold and silver are fairly rare and difficult to extract,
    and they have substantial industrial uses and an enduring nonmonetary appeal in
    jewelry.

    in the early 21st century, inflation-adjusted gold prices dipped into the range
    of $400 to $600 when many governments, including Switzerland, started to sell
    off their massive gold reserves. The metal then briefly peaked at $2,000 before
    settling around $1,200 in the wake of the housing crisis, as many investors fled
    the financial system and moved into physical commodities. The COVID-19 pandemic—or
    rather, the massive stimulus that followed—caused another spike. For as long as
    economic anxieties prevail, the valuations of precious metals will probably stay
    where they are or keep climbing. If the tides turn, I suspect we could see prices

    with good inflation-hedging properties. Ultimately, principled portfolio management
    is more about asking, “What if I’m wrong?” than daydreaming about the glorious

    simple taxation and minimal paperwork requirements, but the constraints and protections

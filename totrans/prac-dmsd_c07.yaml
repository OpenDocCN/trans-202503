    there existed a way to relate the value of various items in common trade, that
    system of prices would permit financial contracts and rudimentary banking to take
    place *without* coinage. Obligations and account balances, perhaps measured in
    customary units such as bushels of grain, could be agreed upon and then tracked

    goods and services, using this quantity of grain as the reference point. Unlike
    in the classical barter model, this unit of account didn’t need to be particularly
    durable, desirable, or easy to carry; it was simply an accounting tool. And indeed,

    of finer coinage happens precisely because it’s desirable as a store of value,
    tucked away rather than spent. Secondly, it’s not a given that the lesser money
    would retain the same standing for long. As confidence in the government’s fiscal
    policy wanes, it’s entirely possible that merchants would refuse to take the state-issued
    currency, demanding more stable alternatives. We know this was the reality of
    many failed states in the 20th century—especially in the Soviet Bloc, where all
    kinds of “luxury” goods had to be purchased with deutsch marks, US dollars, and
    so forth (and where the government hunted the “currency speculators” and occasionally
    locked them up).

    on this approach in response to natural disasters and other pressing social needs;
    it’s plausible that not pursuing such policies might have left our ancestors objectively
    worse off. The supply of metal waxed and waned too, making the value of currency
    fluctuate in unpredictable ways. And because money came to function as a familiar
    and somewhat abstract unit of account in domestic trade, the exact melt value

    of coins as the computational complexity of “mining” operations grows, and as
    some of the previously mined tokens are lost. Over the past couple of years, this
    constraint has caused the price of Bitcoin to increase more than a hundred-fold.
    Early growth created a positive feedback loop, where new investors would be attracted
    to the astonishing returns, and would double down on the currency in hopes of
    even higher gains. This speculative gold rush might be unsustainable—especially
    given that the use of Bitcoin in bona fide trade is minimal, and that future uses
    of this sort are hindered by a range of design flaws that lead to long processing
    times and steep transaction fees.

    simply if your neighbor opens a backyard hog farm. Every asset has a combination
    of “risk vectors” attached to it, pointing in different directions in a multidimensional
    space. The primary goal of a doomsday portfolio is to balance these forces so

    give them (or negative returns when you take inflation into account). Because
    of this, the maximum to keep in the bank is probably the amount for which the
    losses can be regularly replenished without breaking a sweat. To illustrate, let’s
    assume you have one year’s worth of living expenses saved, and that you’re adding
    10 percent of your post-tax income every year. In this scenario, with inflation
    at 2.5 percent and bank interest around 0 percent, roughly one fourth of your
    new contributions would go toward replenishing the purchasing power of your original

  zh: 在金钱方面，通货膨胀无疑是最严重的困扰。过去，银行存款提供足够的利息来抵消损失。但如今，银行充裕的流动性以及对风险较大的投资的新限制，使得银行并不特别需要你的存款，提供几乎为零的名义回报（或者考虑到通货膨胀后的负回报）。因此，存放在银行的最大金额大概是你可以定期补充损失而不费吹灰之力的金额。举个例子，假设你已经存下了一年生活费用，并且每年将税后收入的10%存入银行。在这种情况下，如果通货膨胀率为2.5%而银行利率约为0%，那么大约四分之一的新存款将用于补充原有资金的购买力。别眨眼：如果你存下了两年的生活费用，并且通货膨胀上升至5%，那么你所有的持续存款将实际上变得毫无意义。

    your funds across at least two financial institutions with different risk profiles:
    perhaps a local credit union and a large national bank. This diversification actually

    technical issues, but greatly decreases the odds of losing access to all your
    funds at once. And in places where bank deposits are insured (in the United States,
    the FDIC insurance limit is $250,000 per depositor per bank), even if one of the

    the right for the buyer to collect repayment of the original purchase price of

    red-hot stocks with options strategies (*puts* or *debit put spreads*) that expire
    worthless if the price remains stable or climbs up, but that offer returns of
    100 times or more if the sector goes down in flames. A policy that costs 1 percent
    of your annual income or portfolio value, and that offers broad protection against
    catastrophic losses in your area of livelihood, is probably a pretty good deal.

    as a *protective put* or *married put*. The strategy limits the downside on an
    investment without capping the upside. It’s implemented by purchasing a contract
    that guarantees the right to sell the stock at a preset minimal price. If the
    stock plummets below that price, you have a guaranteed way to recoup some of your
    losses, but if the stock’s value continues to rise, you’re out only the cost of
    the option. Depending on market sentiment, this strategy might not cost much,
    especially for less volatile stocks.

    equity options, retail investors can also trade futures options on commodities
    such as grain, cattle, or copper, or on all kinds of foreign currencies. The mechanics
    of such trades are fairly similar to stock options. For example, if you want to
    purchase insurance against the sudden depreciation of the US dollar, and think
    that the Swiss franc is going to fare considerably better, you can buy an instrument
    that effectively gives you the right to purchase francs for substantially more
    dollars then they’re currently worth. As in other cases, the option will probably
    expire worthless—but because the contract is inexpensive, it can offer dramatic
    returns in response to cataclysmic price shifts.

    in a post-apocalyptic world where all paper money somehow loses its luster. But
    this seems unlikely. Although the metals functioned in this capacity for millennia,
    this day and age, few people have even the faintest idea what a silver coin is
    worth, or how to tell if it’s real. On top of this, relatively few such coins
    are in private possession, and they aren’t distributed in any useful way. In your
    neighborhood, one person might have 1,000 Silver Eagles hidden under the floorboards,
    while 50 other households will have none. An attempt to bootstrap a silver- or

    inflation hedge, but in practice, the commodity seldom behaves this way. Of course,
    in a monetary collapse, gold is bound to hold up value much better than paper
    money, but under normal circumstances, the prices fluctuate significantly for
    reasons that are difficult to ascertain, such as the whims of speculators or the
    geopolitics of mining the metal in faraway lands. When the price of your hedge
    can move 50 percent one way or another for reasons unrelated to inflation, its
    poorly characterized volatility needs to be taken into account—and it better be
    outweighed by the instrument’s potential benefits.

    in comparison to most other assets you can hold in your hand, they’re remarkably
    liquid. Any standard bar or coin can be sold quickly, for cash, close to its spot
    price. Another undeniable plus is that similarly to paper currency, precious metals
    are private. Although some reporting requirements exist in the United States for
    larger trades, they currently apply to only very specific forms of the metal,
    such as gold bars over 32 troy ounces and 1 oz. Mexican onza coins. As for the
    proverbial gold buried in your backyard, that’s strictly between you and the squirrels
    watching from the trees. Finally, the compact size and the high value of gold
    bullion is of note. Individuals fleeing oppressive regimes can carry tens of thousands
    of dollars in life savings in their pocket, and liquidate the metal anywhere in
    the world.

    They charge that just like Bitcoin, gold and silver have no intrinsic value, and
    that all the value derives from the *belief* that a particular metal ought to
    be worth much. That’s a silly argument. *Intrinsic value* doesn’t mean that the
    instrument needs to be worth the same to the reptilians living on Omicron Persei
    8; it’s just that its price comes from the innate characteristics of the asset
    itself. Here on Earth, both gold and silver are fairly rare and difficult to extract,
    and they have substantial industrial uses and an enduring nonmonetary appeal in
    jewelry.

    off their massive gold reserves. The metal then briefly peaked at $2,000 before
    settling around $1,200 in the wake of the housing crisis, as many investors fled
    the financial system and moved into physical commodities. The COVID-19 pandemic—or
    rather, the massive stimulus that followed—caused another spike. For as long as
    economic anxieties prevail, the valuations of precious metals will probably stay

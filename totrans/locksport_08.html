<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/afig00.jpg"/></div>
<p class="noindent">Congratulations, you’ve now learned all the techniques needed to tackle the main competitions at locksport events around the world! In this appendix, we’ll discuss a few locksport games that are frequently played at conferences or run by locksport organizations, but aren’t part of the main competition. We’ll cover the timed head-to-head challenge; a locksport spin on tic-tac-toe; escape challenges; bike lock decoding; and “The Room,” a spy-themed contest. We’ll end by taking a look at Reddit’s belt system, one way to challenge yourself and earn public accolades from the online locksport community.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev110"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_342"/>Timed Head-to-Head Challenge</h3>
<p class="noindent">One competition that appears frequently at conferences like ShmooCon, DEF CON, and various BSides events is the timed <em>head-to-head deadbolt picking challenge</em> (<a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig1">Figure A-1</a>). Competitors are seated at wooden stands, each containing a pin tumbler deadbolt lock. Each deadbolt is the same brand, and all the locks are keyed alike (pinned the same). Each stand contains a built-in switch that’s continually depressed by the bolt until the lock is picked. Those switches are wired to a circuit board or small computer, often an Arduino or Raspberry Pi, which is connected to a timer display that shows the opening time when the switch is triggered.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="app01fig1" src="../images/afig01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-1: Head-to-head timed challenge at an InfoSec conference</em></p>
<p class="indent">When the game organizer says go, competitors pick their lock as fast as they can. Sometimes the fastest person to open in each group is dubbed the winner, though more often every competitor’s time is recorded over the course of a day, and the best times win a prize.</p>
<p class="indent">At least four stand designs are used in the US: two created by Dosman (@dossman33) of the Fraternal Order Of Lock Sport (FOOLS) club in Indiana (<a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig2">Figure A-2</a>), one used by TOOOL US at large conferences (<a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig3">Figure A-3</a>), and one created by Matt and his friend and fellow hacker volty for use at events around Seattle. Three of these designs are functionally the same for competitors, though one of Dosman’s also includes rumble motors to make the locks shake, increasing the difficulty. This stand is called the Rumble Challenge.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="sec150"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_343"/><em>Timed Challenge Tips</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">At first glance, the timed challenge may seem pretty easy: you need to pick just one lock, and usually it’s not even a high-security model. However, several factors make this challenge unique.</p>
<p class="indent">First is the stand itself. Having the lock mounted to a board can be a surprising twist for locksporters who typically hold their locks or mount them in a vise at an angle that suits them. Since picking in this position might feel awkward to you, consider practicing on a lock mounted on a vertical surface before entering this competition. You might also want to ask the judge if you’re allowed to move the stand before you start; placing it on your lap might be more comfortable.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, unlike most locksport picking competitions, in this event it matters which direction you turn the plug. Unlocking the deadbolt requires retracting the bolt, meaning the plug needs to rotate away from the bolt. Whether this means you need to turn the plug clockwise or counterclockwise depends on which way the lock is mounted. For the stand in <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig2">Figure A-2</a>, you’d need to turn the plug counterclockwise to open it. Many contestants miss this detail and waste valuable time picking the lock in the wrong direction.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, rules about placing tension wrenches in the lock before you start picking can vary from event to event. Positioning the wrench ahead of time can save you valuable seconds, so be sure to ask the judge before the round starts whether this is allowed. If it isn’t, ask if you can at least test various turning tools first to see which fits best.</p>
<p class="indent">Fourth, going head-to-head with other people can be intimidating, especially when a timer is running. Try to focus on the lockpicking, not on the timer or on anyone else’s progress. Also try to ignore any spectators, as this type of contest is quite visual and can sometimes draw a crowd. If you’re easily distracted by other people, consider trying to find a lull in the crowd sometime during the event and play then. In lockpick villages at large events, lunch breaks and breaks between talks are usually busy times and best avoided by those who suffer under pressure.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, check the rules for do-overs. Some competitions allow you to retry the contest only a set number of times, if at all. Others may take your best time during the event, or they might average all of your times. Based on the rules, decide whether you’re likely to improve your time by trying the contest more than once. However, be considerate of other competitors and the judges’ time. Even if retries aren’t limited, having one contestant keep trying the contest continually throughout an event can be annoying, especially if judges are overseeing multiple events.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec151"><em>DIY Set Instructions</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Building a timer set of your own can be time-consuming, but it’s reasonably easy. Matt published the code needed to run the timer on a Raspberry Pi on GitHub at <em><a href="https://github.com/mburrough/locktimer">https://github.com/mburrough/locktimer</a></em>, so building a set is mainly a woodworking project. Here we’ll list the materials to build four stands, but feel free to adjust up or down depending on your needs. Since <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_344"/>this design uses US-style deadbolt locks, we’re also specifying the materials in imperial units. Materials in metric equivalents should work just as well. If you’re looking to build only one set for home practice, just quarter the material quantities.</p>

</ul>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Making the Stands</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">Follow these steps to assemble the stands:</p>
<ol>
<li class="noindent">Cut the 2"×6" board into four 12" lengths and four 9" lengths, and cut the 2"×4" board into four 12" lengths. The longer 2"×6" pieces will act as the door to which you’ll mount the deadbolt. The 2"×4" pieces will be the door frame where the bolt of the lock enters. Finally, the shorter 2"×6" pieces will serve as the base for your stands.</li>
<li class="noindent">Drill one large hole through the 12" portion of the 2"×6" to mount the lock. The center of the deadbolt should be about 4.5" down from the top of the board. Use the template included in the door lock installation kit to drill a smaller hole into the side of the 2"×6" for the bolt to pass through.</li>
<li class="noindent">Once the holes are drilled, follow the instructions that come with the deadbolt to install the lock. Make sure all your holes are aligned and the lock is working properly. Note that doors are slightly thicker than 2"×6" lumber, so you may need to adjust the tightness of the screws if the lock isn’t working smoothly. Extend (lock) the bolt by using the key.</li>
<li class="noindent">Next, line up the 2"×4" with the 2"×6". Note where the bolt will need to enter the 2"×4" and how deep it will go, and trace this onto the 2"×4" with a pencil. Also position one of the micro switches on the 2"×4" to determine where it will be depressed when the bolt is engaged, and trace it as well.</li>
<li class="noindent">Using a woodworking router, notch out a pocket on the 2"×4" big enough for the bolt to fully extend, with room for the switch to sit in the pocket as well (see <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig4">Figure A-4</a>). The section under the bolt may need to be deeper than that under the switch so that the switch’s arm can hit the center of the bolt.
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="app01fig4" src="../images/afig04.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-4: A batch of stands with holes drilled for the locks, and pockets cut for the bolts and switches</em></p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_346"/><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>At this point, you could remove the lock from the 2"×6" and sand and paint all the wood parts. However, we prefer to build the entire stand first to make sure everything works, and then disassemble it and paint it at the end</em>.</p>
</div></li>
<li class="noindent">Realign the 2"×4" and the 2"×6" pieces and confirm that the lock still functions. If so, drill two pilot holes through the edge of the 2"×4", one near the top and one near the bottom, and then use 6" screws to connect the two boards (see <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig5">Figure A-5</a> for an example from a completed stand).
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="app01fig5" src="../images/afig05.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-5: Two 6" screws securing the 2"×4" board to the 2"×6" board on a completed stand</em></p></li>
<li class="noindent">Determine where in the pocket the switch will need to sit, and drill two pilot holes for mounting the switch. Also drill one hole below the micro switch completely through the 2"×4" for the switch’s wires.</li>
<li class="noindent">Cut one of the Ethernet cables into 6" lengths. Remove the individual wires from the cable’s jacket. Strip 0.75" of insulation from one end of two of the wires. With your soldering iron, solder two wires to the switch’s terminals. If the switch has three terminals, use the normally closed (NC) and common (com) terminals.</li>
<li class="noindent">Once the solder is cool, place the switch in the pocket and push the cables through the hole to the back of the stand. Screw in the switch and confirm that the bolt still fully extends and that the switch is depressed by the bolt.
<p class="listi">On the back of the stand, install the keystone box over the area where the wires are protruding. The RJ45 keystone jack should come with a punch-down tool; use that to punch the wires into any two of the jack’s eight positions. (The example shown in <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig6">Figure A-6</a> uses orange and white-orange, but it doesn’t matter which you use as long as you’re consistent.) Trim any excess wire. Snap the jack into the keystone box and close the box.</p>
<div class="imagec"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_347"/><img alt="Image" id="app01fig6" src="../images/afig06.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-6: The back side of a completed stand with an open keystone box (left) and a close-up of wires feeding into the RJ45 jack</em></p></li>
<li class="noindent">Drill a hole in each corner of one of the acrylic pieces. To avoid cracking the acrylic, don’t drill closer than half an inch from the edge, and if possible, use a drill bit meant for acrylic (we recommend the ones from TAP Plastics at <em><a href="https://www.tapplastics.com">https://www.tapplastics.com</a></em>). Using the truss head screws, screw the acrylic over the pocket in the 2"×4" (see <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig7">Figure A-7</a>). This will allow contestants to see the bolt but not to touch the switch or wires.</li>
<li class="noindent">Finally, drill two pilot holes three-quarters of an inch from the bottom in the front of the 2"×6" and another on the bottom of the 2"×4". Be careful to avoid hitting the 6" screw connecting the boards. Using these pilot holes, attach the 9-inch 2"×6" with 3" screws, as shown in <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig7">Figure A-7</a>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="app01fig7" src="../images/afig07.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-7: A finished stand</em></p>
<p class="indent">You should now have one fully completed stand that can stand on its own. If everything seems right, repeat the entire process three more times. If you haven’t painted them already, now you can disassemble them, sand any rough edges, paint them, and let them dry. Once they’re dry, reassemble them and attach the rubber feet to the bottom.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Setting Up the Raspberry Pi</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">After building the stands, you need to wire up the Raspberry Pi. Using more scrap Cat5 cable, punch two 8" wires into each of the four remaining RJ45 jacks. Be sure to use the same positions on the jacks that you chose to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_348"/>use on the stands. Run these wires through a hole on the outlet box, snap the jacks in the four-keystone wall plate, and screw the plate to the box with its included screws.</p>
<p class="indent">Make sure the Pi is unplugged; then solder one wire from each jack to a ground pin position on the Pi. For the jack you want to use with the first stand, solder the remaining wire to GPIO 4 on the Pi. Solder the remaining wire for stand 2 to GPIO 17, stand 3 to GPIO 27, and stand 4 to GPIO 22.</p>
<p class="indent">Plug one end of each Ethernet cable into the jack on each stand, and the other end into one of the jacks now connected to the Pi. Connect a USB keyboard and mouse to the Pi, and use the HDMI port to connect the monitor.</p>
<p class="indent">On a computer, install the Raspberry Pi OS on your Pi’s SD card by following the directions at <em><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/">https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/</a></em>. Place the SD card into the Pi, boot it up, and log in. Next you need to download the locktimer program. Connect the Pi to the internet, and then open a terminal window and enter the following:</p>
<pre><span class="codestrong1">sudo pip install guizero</span>
<span class="codestrong1">git clone https://github.com/mburrough/locktimer/</span>
<span class="codestrong1">cd locktimer</span>
<span class="codestrong1">python timer.py</span></pre>
<p class="indent">This installs guizero, a Python library used by locktimer, followed by locktimer itself. Then you move into the locktimer directory to run it.</p>
<p class="indent">You should now see the locktimer interface. If the program doesn’t fit on the screen, run <span class="codestrong">timer-720.py</span> in the last step instead.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Running a Competition</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">Now it’s time to set up a competition! First, make sure that all the locks are locked and the stands are plugged in to the Pi. Click the <strong>Reset + Go</strong> button to start the timers. You should see four individual positions with the status <span class="literal">LOCKED</span>, as well as a larger overall timer. As soon as one of the locks opens, the time for that seat will replace the word <span class="literal">LOCKED</span>, but the timer will continue running for the other seats. Once all the locks are open, the overall timer will also stop.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>The timer code is written for a four-stand setup with four players. You’ll need to edit the code if you want to have more or fewer stands</em>.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">If at any time you want to stop the timer, click <strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking Reset + Go will reset all timers back to 0 and start them over.</p>
<p class="indent">Be sure to have a key handy to reset the locks so that you don’t have to pick them again just to lock them. Consider using double-sided deadbolts, rather than single-sided bolts with a thumb turn on the back, to help prevent cheating.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev111"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_349"/>PicTacToe</h3>
<p class="noindent">Another head-to-head lockpicking competition is <em>PicTacToe</em>™ (see <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig8">Figure A-8</a>), created by FoxPick. In this locksport take on tic-tac-toe, two players try to be the first to pick three locks in a row in an illuminated 3×3 grid.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="app01fig8" src="../images/afig08.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-8: Jenee Rogers of FoxPick ready to start a game of PicTacToe</em></p>
<p class="indent">Gameplay is straightforward: each player is given an electronic game board with nine locks, as well as tension tools and picks. Rakes are not allowed. All locks start illuminated blue, as shown in <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig8">Figure A-8</a>. When a player picks a lock, it turns green on their game board. The corresponding lock on the opponent’s board turns red to indicate that spot is taken. The first player to get three green locks in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins, and the winning line flashes. In the event of a draw (as in <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig9">Figure A-9</a>), both players’ boards flash. After the game ends, the organizer presses two reset buttons, which clears the boards and relocks all the locks.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="app01fig9" src="../images/afig09.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-9: A completed game of PicTacToe that ended in a draw</em></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec152"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_350"/><em>PicTacToe Tips</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">As it’s a fairly new game, none of us have yet had a chance to try PicTacToe. Luckily, the friendly folks at FoxPick have offered several suggestions for competitors. First, as with the head-to-head challenge, players should practice picking locks mounted on boards. Since the PicTacToe board is even larger than the head-to-head lock stands, players won’t be able to make significant adjustments to the position or angle of the locks.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, the locks in PicTacToe aren’t all the same. The center lock is the hardest, the corners are medium difficulty, and the four remaining locks are the easiest. Having a strategy for which lock to target first and which row/column/diagonal you plan to pick before starting will save you time during the competition.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, since rakes aren’t allowed, practice picking using standard hooks. You may also want to practice with picks other than your usual set. Since picks are provided, it’s best to be comfortable working with one that isn’t your favorite.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, this is a player-versus-player contest, so it’s a good idea to practice picking under pressure against someone. Also consider whether you’ll just go for the locks you need to open or also try to block your opponent by targeting a lock in the row they’ve selected.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev112">Escape Challenges</h3>
<p class="noindent"><em>Escape challenges</em> are a type of game that used to be played regularly at various conferences and may still crop up from time to time. The premise is that the contestants have been unlawfully detained and must free themselves from their captors. In the original version, created by Deviant Ollam, the hypothetical scenario was that contestants had been detained by corrupt police officers in a foreign country. Their passports and wallets had been confiscated and locked in a filing cabinet, but their concealed set of lockpicking tools was overlooked.</p>
<p class="indent">Contestants started handcuffed and had five minutes to remove the handcuffs, pick their jail cell or interrogation room lock, pick the filing cabinet lock to retrieve their passport, disable a guard, pick a locker lock to retrieve a guard uniform for disguise, pick a lock on the door leading outside, and optionally pick the lock of a car to use for a getaway.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">WARNING</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>While escaping a captor or playing a secret agent can be fun to imagine, don’t use your locksport skills to actually resist arrest or try to escape the police. Doing so is illegal and dangerous, not to mention it goes against the rules described in <a href="ch1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a></em>.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Of course, an entire jail can’t be transported to all competitions around the world, so suitable stand-ins have been used. A pair of handcuffs, a couple of deadbolts, a wafer cabinet lock, a padlock, and an ignition lock represented the locks described in the scenario. To make the game playable and enjoyable for expert and novice pickers alike, the game’s organizers provided several locks of varying difficulty for each part of the challenge. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_351"/>Scores were determined based on the difficulty of the lock opened at each stage, with extra points added for faster escapes.</p>
<p class="indent">The original version ran for several years at conferences like ShmooCon, Ekoparty, and DEF CON, but it was officially retired in 2011. However, variations of the game live on, surfacing every few years at InfoSec conferences. For example, a spy-themed challenge was presented at ShmooCon 2017. In this variation, two contestants went head-to-head and had to break out of handcuffs, pick a deadbolt to get out of a room, pick a rotary-phone-dial lock (wafer lock) to call for backup, and finally pick a padlock on a duffel bag containing a Nerf gun to shoot a final target and escape (see <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig10">Figure A-10</a>).</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="app01fig10" src="../images/afig10.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-10: The various locks to overcome at one jail break–style competition at ShmooCon 2017</em></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec153"><em>Escape Challenge Tips</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Most of the locks in these competitions, such as deadbolts and padlocks, are ones that most locksporters have picked before—even if they haven’t seen them on a phone or duffel bag. As in the timed lockpicking challenge, the only real hurdles are picking the locks at a potentially uncomfortable angle and making sure you’re turning the plug in the proper direction. However, the other locks in the escape challenge may be new to you. We’ll start with handcuffs and then look at wafer locks.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Handcuffs</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">Handcuffs have been around for centuries and have used a variety of styles and locking mechanisms throughout their history. That said, in many countries, the most common handcuffs are ratcheting cuffs that go on the wrists and are connected by a couple of chain links, like those in <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig11">Figure A-11</a>. These are manufactured by companies such as Peerless Handcuff Company, ASP, and Smith &amp; Wesson.</p>
<div class="imagec"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_352"/><img alt="Image" id="app01fig11" src="../images/afig11.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-11: A standard pair of handcuffs</em></p>
<p class="indent">These handcuffs all work the same way: one half of each wrist’s cuff pivots open on a riveted hinge point and has a series of teeth on the end. This part, called the <em>single strand</em>, is functionally equivalent to the shackle of a padlock. These teeth of the single strand interact with a <em>pawl</em> inside the handcuff’s housing, which is a spring-loaded piece of metal with a few teeth of its own and is similar to the latch found in a padlock (see <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig12">Figure A-12</a>). The locking mechanism for these cuffs is essentially a warded lock. A small protrusion on the key depresses the tip of the pawl, retracting it from the single strand’s teeth, to unlock the cuffs.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="app01fig12" src="../images/afig12.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-12: Cutaway of a standard handcuff</em></p>
<p class="indent">Since the handcuffs ratchet, they are susceptible to the same type of shimming attack as padlocks that have latches. By slipping a thin piece of metal between the single strand and the pawl, you can depress the pawl, unhook the teeth, and pull on the single strand to get it to open. <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig13">Figure A-13</a> shows Matt using a thin tension wrench for this purpose during a competition. Thinner, commercially available handcuff shims also work well and can be purchased online from retailers such as Serepick (<em><a href="https://www.serepick.com">https://www.serepick.com</a></em>) or Handcuff Warehouse (<em><a href="https://www.handcuffwarehouse.com">https://www.handcuffwarehouse.com</a></em>).</p>
<div class="imagec"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_353"/><img alt="Image" id="app01fig13" src="../images/afig13.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-13: Matt shimming his way out of handcuffs at ShmooCon</em></p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>Getting a piece of metal between the teeth of the single strand and the pawl can take a fair bit of force, possibly requiring you to hit the cuffs against a hard surface. Be careful, as this can easily result in bruised wrists, as Matt proved shortly after this photo was taken</em>.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Using a shim is straightforward: insert the tip of the metal below the single strand into the housing, apply pressure on the shim, and then click the single strand one notch tighter. As the teeth of the single strand depress the pawl, the shim should slide between the pawl and the teeth and allow you to pull back on the single strand to release it.</p>
<p class="indent">Realizing this issue with the design, handcuff manufacturers have made most modern handcuffs <em>double locking</em>: a second piece of metal below the pawl can be pushed into place after the cuffs are applied to block the pawl from lowering. This not only prevents shimming but also serves as a safety feature for the handcuffed person; the cuffs can’t be tightened further when double locked, so they won’t accidentally constrict the person’s wrist. To unlock a double-locked handcuff, you must turn the handcuff key in one direction first to release the double lock, then in the opposite direction to lower the pawl.</p>
<p class="indent">In competitions, the double lock is rarely applied. Usually, the only added difficulty is the handcuffs’ placement: behind the back. If you’re flexible, you might be able to overcome this by trying to step over your own arms as if they were a jump rope or by bringing your arms over your head.</p>
<p class="indent">If the cuffs are double locked, you won’t be able to shim them, so you’ll have no choice but to pick the lock or use a handcuff key. From a standard lockpick set, we suggest using either a short hook or half-diamond, though if you have any dimple lock picks, those might work well. Insert your tool in the keyhole perpendicular to the face of the handcuffs, as shown in <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig14">Figure A-14</a>.</p>

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-14: Proper orientation for the picking tool to open handcuffs</em></p>
<p class="indent">Try to push away the double-locking bar and then catch the pawl with the tip of the pick. The bar will be at the bottom of the cuff, near the chain, while the pawl is closer to the wrist, as shown in <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig15">Figure A-15</a>.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="app01fig15" src="../images/afig15.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-15: Rotate the picking tool clockwise to release the double lock, and counterclockwise to retract the pawl</em></p>
<p class="indent">Using picks on handcuffs can be tricky, especially if the cuffs are oriented with the keyhole facing away from you. Another option is to bring your own handcuff key (see <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig16">Figure A-16</a> for an example). The vast majority of handcuffs can be opened using a universal handcuff key, which you can order online for a few dollars. Some universal keys are made to look like <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_355"/>zipper pulls, buttons, coins, and cufflinks in order to be easily concealed. Be sure to check with the contest organizers to see whether these are allowed. In some contests, they’re not permitted at all, and in others using them might deduct partial points from your score. They might also be illegal, so check your local laws!</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="app01fig16" src="../images/afig16.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-16: A standard hook pick profile (top) and handcuff key (bottom). The “spike” on the back of the key (left of the bow) is used for the double lock on some handcuff models</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">To prepare for such a competition, you might want to get a set of handcuffs of your own. Again, check local laws to make sure possessing them is legal. If so, we suggest avoiding clear or cutaway cuffs like the example shown earlier in <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig12">Figure A-12</a>. The acrylic on these can be fragile, and you might break it when attempting to shim or pick the lock. Consider buying the handcuffs in a color other than the popular metallic silver or black to facilitate keeping track of them. If you already have a silver pair, you can always add some decoration to make them stand out.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, and <em>most importantly</em>: when playing with handcuffs, always have several spare keys available, and practice with a friend nearby. You don’t want to get stuck in a situation where you’ve dropped your key and can’t reach it!</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Wafer Locks</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">The wafer locks used on filing cabinets, phone-dial locks, and even vehicles may also be unfamiliar to you from a locksport perspective. Wafer locks are similar to pin tumbler locks in that they contain several blocking elements that need to be lifted to the correct height to allow the plug to rotate, so it’s possible to approach picking them as you would a pin tumbler lock. However, you should be aware of a few tricks and gotchas when you’re dealing with wafers.</p>
<p class="indent">First, wafers are flat plates, not round cylinders like pins. They have no shear line, but if you lift them too high, they’ll block at the top of the plug rather than catching at the bottom. Particularly sharp or aggressively used rakes can then catch on the wafers, potentially damaging them, the small springs used to hold them, or even the rake itself.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, wafers can come from both the top and bottom of the keyway, so on some locks you’ll need to move some wafers upward and some downward. For this reason, <em>ball-end</em> and <em>double-ball</em> picks (also called <em>snowman</em> picks), shown in <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig17">Figure A-17</a>, are popular choices for wafer locks. While <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_356"/>these picks are often scorned in pin tumbler picking, their gentle curves and double-sidedness do well on wafers. Having said that, regular hooks and rakes will also work on wafer locks.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="app01fig17" src="../images/afig17.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-17: Single- and double-ball picks</em></p>
<p class="indent">Next, most wafer locks contain only a few wafers. For file cabinet–type locks, three to five wafers is the norm. Additionally, their tolerances are often poor, meaning the wafers aren’t precisely set to the correct standardized height. Taken together, these two traits mean that key-shaped objects might well open such a lock. Enter the <em>wafer jiggler</em> set: thin pieces of metal cut into shapes that look vaguely key-like, as you can see in <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig18">Figure A-18</a>. By inserting these in the lock (one at a time) and using rocking, raking, or jiggling motions, you have a good chance of opening the lock. You can purchase jigglers from many of the same sellers as regular lock picks.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="app01fig18" src="../images/afig18.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-18: Two sets of wafer jigglers</em></p>
<p class="indent">Another method of opening wafer locks involves using a flat piece of metal, like the handle of a pick or an uncut key that fits the keyway. Insert the object all the way into the keyway, using it both to lift all the wafers and to apply slight rotational pressure on the plug. Then, while still applying turning pressure, slowly pull out the object. Because of the lateral pressure, the wafers may bind on the lock housing as they drop, allowing the plug to rotate. This can take some practice and may not work on higher-quality locks.</p>
<p class="indent">If all these methods fail, simply try single-pin picking the wafers or raking with your least aggressively shaped rake. One final word of caution: some wafer plugs are held in their housing by the rearmost wafer in the lock, which is usually spaced a bit farther away from the other wafers. If you pick this wafer, which is especially likely if you’re raking the lock, the entire plug will come out of the lock. This feature allows a special key to remove the plug to make rekeying easy. If this happens, you might still be able to open the lock by reaching a tool into the back of the housing and rotating the cam or manipulating the latch directly. To reinstall the plug, depress the wafers so they’re flush with the plug and slip the plug back into the housing.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev113"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_357"/>Direct-Entry Chain and Cable Locks</h3>
<p class="noindent">In informal competitions at locksport events, you’ll frequently come across <em>direct-entry</em> combination padlocks and cheap bike chains, with too many variations and manufacturers to name. These generally have three, four, or occasionally five code wheels, like the one shown in <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig19">Figure A-19</a>. Each code wheel has one gate through which the teeth can pass, so when all the gates are aligned, all the teeth can pass and the lock opens. The better locks include one or two smaller false gates that the teeth can’t fit through to make it harder to find the true gate.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="app01fig19" src="../images/afig19.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-19: A five-wheel direct-entry cable lock, partially opened</em></p>
<p class="indent">As always, you’ll need to tension the lock and look for the binding element. Pulling on the shackle will cause one or more of the wheels to tilt or jam against a tooth (see <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig20">Figure A-20</a>). Simply find the wheel that is binding (it will be the most difficult wheel to turn), and rotate it until it is free, or loose, or wobbly. Often the shackle will come out a little too. Now locate the next wheel that’s binding and repeat the process until the lock opens.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="app01fig20" src="../images/afig20.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-20: The wheels of a direct-entry combination lock (left) and the shackle (right)</em></p>
<p class="indent"><a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig21">Figure A-21</a> shows a cross-section of the lock. You can see that the blue shackle interacts directly with the yellow wheels. The housing is red. The two wheels on the left are still blocking the shackle, preventing it from being removed, and the two on the right are in a true gate. Under heavy <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_358"/>tension, the righthand two wheels would wiggle loosely, and the other two would be jammed.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="app01fig21" src="../images/afig21.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-21: A cross section of the shackle interacting with the wheels</em></p>
<p class="indent">When you come across antimanipulation false gates, you’ll generally find that they’re smaller. With practice, you can differentiate them from a true gate by feel; a true gate will give a bit more play in the shackle than a false one. Even if you haven’t mastered differentiating false and true gates, you’ll find that once all the positions are set on a gate, you can easily tell which wheel is in a false gate, as it will start to bind again. Often there’s only one false gate per wheel, which is usually directly opposite the true gate. Sometimes, however, two or four false gates are located at fixed intervals all the way around.</p>
<p class="indent">Some of the better designs have a release button for the shackle that you may have to press to tension the lock. With practice, you’ll be able to amaze your friends with how fast you can beat these locks.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev114">The Room</h3>
<p class="noindent">At the HackerHotel conference held in the Netherlands in 2019, locksporters Jos, Jan-Willem Markus, and Rob Wiegertjes from TOOOL NL introduced a new competition called The Room. This competition is a spy/detective–themed scenario challenge. Teams are given seven minutes to enter a staged hotel room and gather as much information about the occupant as possible, while leaving no evidence they’ve entered the room. For videos of the 2019 event, see <em><a href="https://blackbag.toool.nl/?p=2772">https://blackbag.toool.nl/?p=2772</a></em>.</p>
<p class="indent">While not strictly locksport focused, the challenge has some interesting lock-related aspects. First, teams must find a way to enter the room. You’ll be provided with an <em>under-door tool</em>: a long piece of stiff metal wire about 100 cm (40 inches) long, with a handle bent into one end and a hook bent into the other, shown in <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig22">Figure A-22</a>. A flexible wire, slightly longer than the rigid wire, is connected to the hook end. You slip the tool in the gap between the bottom of the door and the floor and rotate it upward to hook the door handle. Pulling down on the flexible wire flexes the rigid wire, pulling down on the door handle.</p>
<div class="imagec"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_359"/><img alt="Image" id="app01fig22" src="../images/afig22.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-22: An under-door tool</em></p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig23">Figure A-23</a>, you can see Walter opening a glass door with an under-door tool. Since most commercial doors automatically unlock when the inner handle is pulled, this tool allows you to open the door without a key.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="app01fig23" src="../images/afig23.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-23: Walter using an under-door tool</em></p>
<p class="indent">Once inside the room, the team must procure evidence from several locked items. The locked items are sure to change from year to year, but past examples include a wafer lock on a cash box (<a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig24">Figure A-24</a>), a hotel room safe with electronic code keypad, a briefcase with a three-wheel combination lock, and a high-security padlock on a lockbox. You can approach these locks in multiple ways, but keep in mind that part of your task is to leave no trace, so you must pick them back to the locked position when you’re done.</p>
<div class="imagec"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_360"/><img alt="Image" id="app01fig24" src="../images/afig24.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-24: A keyed lockbox from The Room</em></p>
<p class="indent">You can sometimes decode briefcase wheel locks like direct-entry bike locks—by pressing the release button on the case while spinning the wheels. If this doesn’t work, you could slip a thin piece of metal between a wheel and the lock housing, rotate the wheel, and try to feel for any notches or flat sections of the wheel; then repeat this for the other wheels. If you’ve found a flat section or notch on each wheel and the case doesn’t open, rotate all the wheels in the same direction and try again. For example, if you found notches at 3-7-2, try 4-8-3, then 5-9-4, and so forth. Many wheeled combination locks, like the one shown in <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig25">Figure A-25</a>, can be decoded this way.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="app01fig25" src="../images/afig25.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-25: The combination lock on a briefcase used in The Room</em></p>
<p class="indent">For other locks, such as the electronic safe lock shown in <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig26">Figure A-26</a>, you’ll need to look around the room for clues. You may find three- or four-digit codes written somewhere that could open combination locks, or you might find keys hidden someplace that can open keyed locks that aren’t realistic to pick within the limited timeframe.</p>
<div class="imagec"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_361"/><img alt="Image" id="app01fig26" src="../images/afig26.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-26: An electronic safe used in The Room</em></p>
<p class="indent">Opening the most locks, or even getting the most evidence, doesn’t guarantee a win in this game. It’s more important to leave no trace of your presence. The winning team in the 2019 competition gave this advice: take lots of pictures. Photos not only provide copies of evidence but also can be used to reference an item’s original position in the room so you can put everything back accurately. That team took over 850 photos during its seven-minute run.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, remember to wear gloves. Touching items in the room leaves fingerprints, which will count against you. You could take this a step further and wear a mask to avoid being identified on any hidden cameras. Taking it to the extreme, you might also consider wearing protective covers on your shoes to avoid tracking in dirt.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, assume that the subject of the investigation is very detail oriented. This means that simply leaving items <em>where</em> you found them isn’t enough; you must also leave them <em>how</em> you found them. For example, if a pen was on the edge of a notebook and pointed toward the door, make sure it’s in the same orientation before you leave.</p>
<p class="indent">Fourth, don’t take items from the room. Even if something looks like trash that won’t be missed or is just one piece of paper out of a large stack, the subject will likely notice it. Similarly, don’t throw away or leave behind anything you brought into the room.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, remember to look everywhere you can. Items may be hidden in unusual locations, like under the mattress, in a pillowcase, under the trash bag inside the trash can, or taped to the underside of a drawer. Simply finding the obvious items won’t be sufficient to win the competition.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev115">The Belt System</h3>
<p class="noindent">Inspired by martial arts, the organizers of the Reddit lockpicking community at <em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/">https://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/</a></em> have developed a color-based belt-ranking system to classify the relative difficulty of picking various brands and models of locks. Members of the subreddit who can show that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_362"/>they’ve picked a lock—and met the other requirements corresponding to a given belt color—are then awarded that belt as a flair badge for their Reddit profile and the Lockpickers United Discord server (see <a href="app01.xhtml#app01fig27">Figure A-27</a>).</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="app01fig27" src="../images/afig27.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-27: A redacted Reddit thread showing users’ belt flair</em></p>
<p class="indent">For the lower ranks, you can simply submit a photo of the picked lock to gain that rank. Middle ranks require you to submit a video of the lock being both picked and disassembled to demonstrate in one take that the lock hasn’t been modified to make it easier to pick. For the most advanced ranks—including purple, brown, red, and black—members must pick multiple difficult locks from a list of accepted locks while on video and must also engage with the community in other ways, such as posting frequently, creating and sharing custom challenge locks, and building custom tools.</p>
<p class="indent">To give some examples, picking any lock at all will earn you an entry-level white belt; a picked and gutted ABUS 72/40 earns you a green belt; a Fichet 666 is brown-belt territory; and an ABLOY Protec<sup>2</sup> merits a black belt. Note that a lock’s specific belt ranking can change over time (for example, if new methods of opening the lock are found), so always check the subreddit for the current list before attempting to earn a belt. A full description of the criteria for earning a belt, and the list of locks that qualify for each, can be found at <em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/wiki/beltranking/">https://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/wiki/beltranking/</a></em>.</p>
<p class="indent">The belt system is an interesting way to classify locks and can be helpful for beginners to determine, relatively speaking, how challenging a lock might be to open. However, the system does have its detractors. Some criticisms include the requirement to exclusively use single-pin picking to open locks at or above the green-belt level, the requirement to submit a video for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_363"/>locks at or above orange, and the fact that the system doesn’t account for factors such as a lock’s bitting.</p>
<p class="indent">If you like filming your picking attempts, enjoy socializing on Reddit or the associated Discord server, and like the idea of flair, then go for it! If not, don’t feel this makes you any less of a lockpicker. Plenty of highly skilled locksporters don’t worry about belts!<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_364"/></p>

- en: For the next year, the team worked furiously on smaller bug-fix releases as
    well as larger “dessert” releases, culminating in the Eclair release that shipped
    with the Droid device at the end of 2009\. In one year alone, the team shipped
    four major releases 1.1 (Petit Four), 1.5 (Cupcake), 1.6 (Donut), and 2.0 (Eclair).

    a perfectionist, and he wanted the product to get better. It really upsets him
    personally when the product is not good enough. But it was also an intentional
    strategy to stop OEMs from trying to fork by saying, ‘By the time you get your
    fork up, we’ll have the new version of Android out, and you’re going to have to
    start over again.’'

    1.0 was released in September of 2008\. That release was the one installed on
    the G1 phones that were then sold in October. In November, r2 was released, which
    added some functionality and apps, in addition to various bug fixes.

    for “little oven”). It was a relatively small release, with bug fixes and a few
    API additions. It also provided localization for other languages (1.0 had support
    for English only), which turned out to be an important feature for this very international
    platform.'

    number after the first dot, in this case 1.1 versus the original release of 1.0),
    it meant that there were API changes in the release. API changes meant that applications
    built against the previous version of the SDK would run on the newer version (Android
    always tries to maintain forward compatibility), but applications built against
    the new version might not run on the old version (because use of new APIs that
    don’t exist on the older version would cause an error on the older system).

    although it was clearly not following the convention of starting with successive
    letters in the alphabet; that tradition would start with the next release, Cupcake.

    It started with “C” because it was the third major release and “Cupcake” was chosen
    as the C dessert name because Ryan PC Gibson (the person running the releases
    at the time) was obsessed with cupcakes.^([1](#c43-footnote-1))

    first appeared. Video recording was now available. Developers could develop and
    distribute their own keyboard applications. Also, there was a new sensor and logic
    to detect rotation, so users could rotate their phone for landscape versus portrait
    mode display. Prior to that change, users needed to slide out the keyboard on
    the G1, which automatically put the display into landscape mode.

    The telephony stack now supported CDMA, the system used by Verizon (this would
    come in handy with, for example, the Motorola Droid, which launched on the Verizon
    network). The framework team finished adding support for arbitrary screen sizes
    and densities, which was important in enabling a broader ecosystem of all kinds
    of different form factors.^([4](#c43-footnote-4)) Donut also included a speech-to-text
    engine. It was not nearly as powerful as the systems used in phones today but
    was an indicator of where things could go.

    shipped after the Donut release—just one month separated them.^([6](#c43-footnote-6))
    Not only was the team working very hard at the time on multiple, frequent releases
    in parallel, but in fact the Eclair release was actually finished *before* the
    Donut release shipped.

    navigation.^([7](#c43-footnote-7)) But perhaps the most notable thing about Eclair
    was that it was implemented in conjunction with the new Droid and Passion (Nexus
    One) devices, which launched soon after Eclair was released. The Passion device
    was the one that the team really had its heart set on, but the Droid was the first
    device that was successful with a large consumer market.

    since the days of CSS1\. What developers *wanted* to do with borders, however,
    outstripped what they *could* do with them years ago. Adding border effects like
    rounded corners or shadows has probably been responsible for more extraneous empty
    markup elements than almost anything else in the web development world. Things
    that should have been simple often involved some incredibly complex workarounds.

- en: Since the earliest days of the Web, designers have been putting rounded corners
    on page elements. That they’ve had no way to create them without using images
    seems crazy. To create a box of flexible width with four rounded corners has meant
    creating four images and adding at least two extra nonsemantic elements, which
    made maintaining a website much harder than it needed to be.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But no more. The Backgrounds and Borders Module introduces a way to round the
    corners of your elements using CSS alone. Each corner is treated as a quarter
    ellipse, which is defined by a curve that is drawn between a point on the *x*-axis
    and a point on the *y*-axis (you may remember those from [Chapter 6](ch06.html#ch06)).
    [Figure 9-1](ch09.html#ch09fig1) illustrates this more clearly.

    the same, or *irregular*, which means the length along each axis is different.

    axes but a negative spread value (−6px), which makes the shadow smaller than its
    box. The fourth example has a medium gray–colored shadow with a negative vertical
    distance, meaning the shadow falls above the element instead of below it.

- en: The fifth box has two shadows applied to it, with each set of values separated
    by a comma. The first value set is the same as in the fourth box, and the second
    makes a black (or inherited color) shadow with a negative horizontal distance,
    causing the shadow to fall to the left of the box.

- en: I briefly mentioned the optional `inset` keyword at the beginning of the previous
    section. If present, this keyword draws a shadow on the interior of the box, but
    it also has the effect of “flipping” the shadow to the other side of the box.
    What I mean is that where a regular—that is, *outset*—shadow with positive *x*
    and *y* values would appear at the bottom right of the box, an inset shadow would
    appear at the top left.

    it’s almost the inverse of [Figure 9-13](ch09.html#ch09fig13); all offset, blur
    radius, and color values are the same, but the shadows now appear on the interior
    of the boxes, and in the opposite corners.

    IE9+ and all other modern browsers. The `-webkit-` prefix is required for older
    versions of Safari for iOS and the stock Android browser.

- en: I mentioned at the beginning of the previous chapter that the Backgrounds and
    Borders Module became a priority for the W3C because of the clamor from web developers.
    The new properties it introduces are extremely handy for removing extraneous elements
    used as containers for purely visual styling from markup, giving developers finer
    control over the way pages are presented. With a multitude of new background and
    border properties at our disposal, creating websites that can be viewed at many
    different sizes and resolutions is going to be much easier, and our sites will
    be more suited to the cross-platform ideal of the age.

    a look at the new color and opacity controls that CSS3 provides.

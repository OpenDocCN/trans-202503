			<p class="BodyFirst">A huge thanks to our editor, Athabasca Witschi. This book wouldn’t be what it is without her. Gratitude to Kim Wimpsett for copyediting help, Jamie Lauer for proofreading, and to Bill Pollock, Barbara Yien, Katrina Taylor, and others at No Starch for guiding two newbies through the book writing process.</p>
			<p>Thanks to our review crew: Joy Gao, Alejandro Crosa, Jason Carter, Zhengliang (Zane) Zhu, and Rachel Gita Schiff. Your feedback was invaluable. Thanks to Todd Palino for feedback on operations chapters, to Matthew Clower for an honest and exhaustive review of Chapter 6, to Martin Kleppmann and Pete Skomoroch for publisher introductions and guidance, and to Tom Hanley, Johnny Kinder, and Keith Wood for feedback on the management chapters.</p>
			<p>We couldn’t have written this book without support from our employers and managers. Thanks to Chris Conrad, Bill Clerico, Aaron Kimball, and Duane Valz for letting us take a shot at this project.</p>

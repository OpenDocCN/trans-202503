    2-1](ch02.xhtml#ch02fig1). Note, however, that different manufacturers arrange
    the pins differently. The safest bet when you’re using a new transistor is to
    check the pinout in the transistor’s documentation, or *datasheet*.

- en: In this project, you’ll build a touch sensor by creating a touchpad from two
    uninsulated wires. Using a transistor, you can detect when someone touches the
    touchpad and turn a light on. When someone touches the touchpad, the high resistance
    in their finger connects the base of the transistor to the positive terminal of
    the battery. This completes the path from the battery’s positive terminal to its
    negative terminal and allows a tiny current to flow from the base to the emitter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The current is tiny because human skin is a poor conductor and has a high resistance;
    the current is too weak to light an LED directly, which is why we need the transistor.
    The tiny current flowing from the base to the emitter will turn the transistor
    “on” so that a larger current can flow from the collector to the emitter. Current
    will flow through the LED and the resistor—making the LED light up—only if the
    transistor is turned on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When nobody is touching the touchpad, the base is left unconnected, so no current
    will flow through that pin and the LED will not light up.

    2-2](ch02.xhtml#ch02fig2). Then place these horizontally on two rows. Leave one
    hole open for connecting the touchpad to the rest of the circuit.

- en: To get current to flow in a circuit, you need a path from the battery’s positive
    terminal to its negative terminal. If you don’t have this path, current can’t
    flow and the LED won’t light up. Turning the transistor “on” allows current to
    flow through it from its collector to its emitter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To turn the transistor on, you need to have current flowing from its base to
    its emitter, which in turn lets current flow from its collector to its emitter.
    The amount of current flowing from the base to the emitter controls how much current
    can flow from the collector to the emitter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can find the relationship between the base-to-emitter and the collector-to-emitter
    currents from the *current gain* of the transistor. The gain is often called h[FE]
    or β (beta). For a general-purpose transistor like the one you’re using here,
    the current gain is about 100\. This means the collector-to-emitter current can
    be up to 100 times larger than the base-to-emitter current.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this circuit, when no one is touching the touchpad, there is no current flowing
    from the base to the emitter. This means the transistor is “off” and there’s no
    current flowing through the resistor and the LED.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you touch the touchpad, your finger acts as a resistor from the positive
    terminal of the battery to the base of the transistor. A tiny current runs through
    the base to the emitter, which produces a larger current from the collector to
    the emitter. Current will also run through your LED, lighting it up.

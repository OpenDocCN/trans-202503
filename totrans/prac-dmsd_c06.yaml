    where money has no meaning and all transactions are settled with ammunition, seeds,

    can ease the pain and lessen the anxiety of sudden car trouble or a leaky roof,

    Perhach in 2016, titled “A Story of a Fuck Off Fund.” In it, the author describes
    a young female protagonist who goes through life with thousands in credit card
    debt, and who rationalizes staying with an abusive boyfriend and tolerating unwanted
    sexual advances from her boss simply because the alternative is worse: unemployment
    and no way to make the rent. The same story is then retold from the perspective
    of a protagonist who has several months’ worth of living expenses squirreled away.
    It’s a simple but worthwhile read: [https://www.thebillfold.com/2016/01/a-story-of-a-fuck-off-fund/.](https://www.thebillfold.com/2016/01/a-story-of-a-fuck-off-fund/.)'

    for most. As noted in Chapter 2, around two-thirds of American families say they’d
    have difficulty coping with an unexpected expense of as little as $1,000\. For
    folks living in poverty or profoundly down on their luck, the matter is out of
    their hands. For millions of others, however, the lack of savings amounts to a
    choice, albeit not always a conscious one.

    adults have the presence of mind to carefully consider the financial trade-offs.
    The US government tries to level the playing field for applicants, but does so
    rather clumsily: it encourages lending through direct subsidies and through laws
    that eliminate much of the underwriting risk. These policies shower schools with
    cheap money while removing most incentives to keep tuition in check. The end result

    if you will—for all the unpleasantries of salaried work. It’s a reward for getting
    up in the morning, sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and dealing with difficult
    coworkers or rude customers. For many people, it follows that what’s left after
    paying the bills is best spent on small indulgences and comforts that make up
    for the tedium of 9-to-5 life.

    to master a rare skill. When money is framed this way, the quintessential decision

    lives ostentatiously beyond his means—and against this backdrop, we conclude that
    we aren’t prone to fiscal excess. But in real life, such overt examples of financial
    recklessness are rare. The true enemies are the hundreds of small, instinctive
    purchases made without a clear way to tally their cumulative cost. In most cases,
    far greater savings can be realized by examining all the recurring sub-$100 expenses
    than by poring over big-ticket stuff.

    successful families tend to gradually shift toward fancier grocers and upper-shelf
    brands of commodities such as cooking oil, milk, flour, spices, and salt. The

    jar, compared to less than $1 per pound for the plain kind, for instance, and
    I’d wager that few people can tell them apart in a blind taste test. Similarly,
    everyday products such as shampoo, toothpaste, and mouthwash can command exorbitant
    premiums for not much more than nicer packaging and a slew of dubious marketing
    claims. The savings add up quickly: shaving $12 off a typical grocery bill translates
    to $1,000 in extra cash within a year.'

    HD streaming, gaming, and videoconferencing, with precious few household uses

    to a higher tier, trying out the slower lane for a week or two carries little

    examination. As a general rule, insurance makes sense as a hedge against catastrophic
    and unlikely loss. Conversely, it’s almost never worth it when dealing with events
    that are common and can be handled without facing financial ruin. As an example,
    comprehensive car insurance is a valuable tool for many families because it protects
    a precious asset against theft or other total loss. At the same time, it’s not
    a cost-effective way to deal with minor issues, such as cracked windshields or
    busted side-view mirrors. Raising the deductible on your policy to $1,000 or $1,500—and
    covering small repairs out of pocket—can save thousands in insurance premiums
    that would otherwise be due over the lifespan of a car. To be fair, low deductibles
    can serve as a stopgap measure for folks who lack the liquidity to pay for minor
    repairs, but the added monthly expense is a sure way to stay illiquid for longer
    too.

    it usually doesn’t hurt to intentionally fall behind, perhaps by skipping a generation
    of hardware or upgrading to last year’s best. As food for thought, one large and

    strictly to playing computer games that are at least a year old. The followers

    we’re tempted to buy a new phone or start picking up fancier olive oil at the

    then continue as if nothing has changed. A less severe variant is to divert half
    the money to your emergency fund, and then spend the other half. Either way, if
    you stick to such an approach, your expenses are bound to grow more slowly than
    your income—and that’s the ultimate secret to long-term financial resiliency.

    look at debt not through the prism of moral choices or political narratives, but
    as a somewhat costly and risky tool. When used recklessly, the tool can cost you
    a finger or an eye; but when employed wisely, it can help you achieve important
    goals. To give just one example, a fixed-rate mortgage can be a robust way to
    hedge against rampant inflation, more so than stockpiling silver or gold. A currency
    may decline in value, but your monthly mortgage payment will stay the same, effectively
    giving you a good portion of your home for free—that is, as long as your income

    of credit (HELOCs) are commonly used to finance purchases that aren’t urgently
    needed, instead of waiting tediously until we have enough money saved. Following
    such a purchase, though, the next installment on the loan can put serious strain
    on the household budget, prompting other expenses—such as groceries—to be financed
    too. The cycle of loan payments and subsequent budget shortfalls can continue
    for months or years, long after the initial purchase has faded out of view. Worse
    yet, because the interest on credit card debt is so steep, this depressing routine
    amounts to giving out a significant proportion of one’s income to cover the fees.'

    worrying too much about existing mortgages or student loans doesn’t make sense.
    They’re difficult to repay quickly, tend to have lower interest rates than credit

    credit card balances right away, before the debt and interest has a chance to

    other hand, from the perspective of emergency preparedness, starting with a short-term
    safety net may be preferable, so that a recession doesn’t catch you off guard.

    of your paycheck is a risky deal, while going over 30 percent is almost certainly
    a bad idea, at least as far as financial continuity planning goes. When in doubt,
    aim lower. It’s a lot easier and a lot less demoralizing to trade up than to downgrade

    in emergency planning. A dry spell in the job market that lasts three months is
    far more likely than one that lasts three years; saving for the former is eminently
    achievable and unquestionably beneficial, while saving for the latter may take
    a decade or more without ever proving to be necessary. On the flip side, economic
    downturns are some of the longer-lasting hardships worth planning for, and the
    unique beauty of investing your money into a savings fund instead of, for example,
    a pallet of canned cheese, is that the former can easily be repurposed as circumstances
    change. A surplus portion of the rainy-day fund can be used to self-finance larger
    purchases without paying a penny in credit card interest, to bootstrap a business,
    or to plan for early retirement.

    As your savings grow, a strong positive reinforcement mechanism usually develops

    this mental framework, many lottery winners and heirs of wealthy families slide
    into financial ruin, addiction, or worse. Living below your means might not make

<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">T</span>he iPhone was announced in January of 2007 and released in June, six months later. The device relied on a touchscreen<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c37-footnote-1" id="c37-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> for user interaction, and affected both consumers and the industry overall, changing what the world considered to be a smartphone and what Android needed to do to compete in the evolving smartphone marketplace.</p>
<p>There was a quote from an engineer on the Android team at that time that has appeared in various places since: “As a consumer I was blown away. I wanted one immediately. But as a Google engineer, I thought ‘We’re going to have to start over.’”<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c37-footnote-2" id="c37-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This quote implies that the iPhone caused Android to change everything and reboot its development plans.</p>
<p>But it’s not quite correct.</p>
<p>It’s true that Android’s plans changed, but the team didn’t have to start over. Rather, they needed to re-prioritize and change product schedules.</p>
<p>When the iPhone was announced, the Android team was very much heads-down in development. The device they were working on was called Sooner, so named because they wanted it to come out sooner than the real target device for Android, the Dream (which was based on the HTC Dream <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_304" title="304"/>hardware). Sooner had no touchscreen. Instead, it relied on a hardware keyboard for UI navigation, which was a common user experience on phones . . . before touchscreens became must-have features.</p>
<p>The Dream device did have a touchscreen, and the Android platform was being designed to incorporate that capability. But Dream was slated to launch later while the team focused on shipping 1.0 with the Sooner device, well, sooner. Suddenly, touchscreen capability had to be prioritized and shifted from a future device to the first device. And that first device had to change accordingly.</p>
<p>The Sooner was dropped, and development pivoted to the Dream device (which was eventually launched in the US as the T-Mobile G1). Brian Swetland remarked on the team’s pivot: “When the iPhone happened, the decision was: We’re going to skip shipping Sooner and we’re gonna ship Dream as soon as it’s ready. Because it didn’t make sense to ship a BlackBerry wedge after Steve<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c37-footnote-3" id="c37-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup> shipped the iPhone.”</p>
<p>Dianne Hackborn liked the change in plans and saw it as an opportunity to finish the platform. “If it would have shipped, there wouldn’t have been multiprocess. I was so stressed about that. I was glad that we dropped Sooner. The software schedule just didn’t line up with the hardware schedule.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the team also built out the platform capabilities to support touchscreen functionality in 1.0. Jason Parks said, “As soon as we flipped, Marco [Nelissen] got touch panels and hacked it up<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c37-footnote-4" id="c37-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup> and we had touch.”<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c37-footnote-5" id="c37-footnoteref-5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Swetland talked about the rumors that Android completely restarted development because of touch. “I feel like we should be honored that they believe we could completely reset and rebuild the entire world in three months, and not that we spent years ahead of time building up adaptive UI and the tooling that let us rejigger the world and had all this work done ahead of time.”</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_305" title="305"/>But there were some misgivings on the team about the change. Mike Fleming said, “I was upset that we hadn’t shipped. I thought that we could’ve gotten out before the iPhone had we shipped the Sooner product.”</p>
<p>In any case, the team was definitely talking about the iPhone after the initial announcement. A lot. <em>The Brady Bunch</em> is a classic American sitcom from the early 1970s. In one episode, Jan is tired of her older sister, Marsha, getting all of the attention. At one point, Jan exclaims, “Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!” Soon after the iPhone announcement, while the Android building was buzzing with discussions about the new device, Andy sent an email to the team that read, “iPhone, iPhone, iPhone!”</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">The iPhone announcement affected all of the mobile manufacturers, rippling through the entire mobile industry, causing fear and, ultimately and rather ironically, creating a major reason that Android was able to establish itself in the market.</p>
<p>When the iPhone was announced, users saw a new expression of the smartphone, with more capabilities and a touchscreen-driven user interface. But carriers and manufacturers saw a potential monopoly being formed, one that would exclude them.</p>
<p>The iPhone was going to have a single manufacturer: Apple. All of the device manufacturers not named “Apple” would be cut out of that market. Also, the iPhone would initially work with only a single carrier in each market (such as AT&amp;T in the US), ensuring that no other carriers would benefit from iPhone users (and their precious data usage) on their network until that exclusive contract expired. Other manufacturers in the ecosystem, such as chip vendors, were also afraid of being excluded; if Apple didn’t happen to choose their chips for iPhone hardware, then they too would be left out.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_306" title="306"/>Suddenly, companies that had previously feared or disregarded Google were not only returning Google’s calls; they were approaching Google all on their own. They needed a comparable smartphone product, and Android offered a way to have one much sooner than they could have had otherwise.</p>
<p>The iPhone launch “scared the industry,” said Iliyan Malchev. “Nobody had anything remotely as good at the time. Frankly, neither did we; it took us time to converge. But there was no other game in town.”</p>
<p>So the Android team continued developing the OS, and working with this growing group of partners, and eventually provided a platform that they could all use to build their own products for the evolving smartphone market.</p>

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c37-footnoteref-4" id="c37-footnote-4">4.</a></sup>  Pivots like this showed the advantage of the platform (versus “product”) focus of the team’s efforts. Cédric Beust said, “The reason why we were able to pivot so fast is that the code base already had a lot of flexibility built in for future and hypothetical hardware.”</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c37-footnoteref-5" id="c37-footnote-5">5.</a></sup>  Dream devices didn’t come in for some time, especially in quantities that the entire team could use them. So they used hardware that would allow them to develop and test touch capabilities for the platform independent of the specific device that would launch with touchscreen support.</p></aside>

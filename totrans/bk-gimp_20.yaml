    You might copy and paste the selected area elsewhere, or adjust its color balance,
    or paint on it, or apply a transformation. In fact, the selection mechanism is
    central to many of GIMP’s common uses.

- en: The simplest definition of a selection is that it’s an outline of a region within
    an image that will be selected. In fact, in GIMP terminology, the term *selection*
    is used for the outline itself and for the contents of this outline (i.e., what
    is selected). In this chapter we refer to the outline as the *selection* and the
    region of the image inside the outline as the *selected pixels*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you make a selection in GIMP, the selection’s outline is indicated by *marching
    ants*. This is the name coined for the moving dotted line that surrounds the selected
    pixels. In [Figure 13-1](ch13s01.html#marching_ants_delimit_the_selectiondot "Figure 13-1. Marching
    ants delimit the selection."), we made a rectangular selection around the statue.
    All the pixels of the image inside the rectangle are selected; all the pixels
    outside are not.

    The delineation of a selection made with the Fuzzy Select tool (![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1453794.png.jpg))
    isn’t as clear. When you click an image with the Fuzzy Select tool, all the pixels
    contiguous to the initial point, and those similar to it by some threshold defined
    in the tool options, are selected. Depending on the image and the threshold, calculating
    which pixels are selected and which are not is easy, but the outline is often
    complex and difficult to follow. If you drag the mouse pointer after clicking,
    you can adjust the threshold, thus increasing or decreasing the number of selected
    pixels. [Figure 13-4](ch13s01.html#extending_the_selection_made_with_the_fu "Figure 13-4. Extending
    the selection made with the Fuzzy Select tool") shows this process. The present
    selection outline appears as a thick, fuzzy line, and the new outline, which appears
    at the bottom of [Figure 13-4](ch13s01.html#extending_the_selection_made_with_the_fu
    "Figure 13-4. Extending the selection made with the Fuzzy Select tool"), is still

    some segments of the selection are much too complicated to be considered an outline.
    [Figure 13-5](ch13s01.html#detail_of_the_selection_in_figure_13dot4 "Figure 13-5. Detail

    as a layer of the current image, except the new layer appears in red (by default).
    Completely white pixels in this new layer are 100% selected in the current image.
    Completely red pixels aren’t selected at all. Pink pixels (i.e., partially red
    ones) are selected to a degree that’s inversely proportional to their redness—the
    lighter the pink of the mask, the greater the selection percentage in the image.
    In our example, the pixels in the middle of the sky are 100% selected, but in
    the upper part of the sky, they’re only partially selected. Although we’ve described
    the selection based on the default color of red, you can change the setting to
    show the selection mask in any color you want by right-clicking the Quick Mask
    button.

    of a graphics tablet. To build a selection, click at the beginning of the outline
    of the intended selection and draw along it until you return to the initial point.
    When a white dot appears in place of the open circle, the outline is complete
    and will be closed once you release the mouse button. If you release the mouse
    button earlier, a hollow circle appears where the button was released. If you
    hover over the circle, it fills in, and the mouse pointer changes to the Move
    icon. If you move one of the endpoints of the selected curve, the orientation
    and size of the curve change, but the shape remains the same, as illustrated in

    clicked is circled, and the pointer includes the Move icon, which indicates that
    you can move this last point. When the mouse pointer is close to the starting
    point, a closed circle appears on that point, and when you click, the path closes
    and the selection is finalized. As soon as this happens, the shape of the selection
    can’t be changed, at least not with the Free Select tool itself.

    of an image. When the tool is active, the pointer looks like the Free Select tool’s
    pointer. The sentence “Roughly outline the object to extract” appears in the mode
    line of the Image window. Begin by outlining the object in the same way that you
    would when using the Free Select tool, as shown in [Figure 13-48](ch13s02.html#outlining_the_cat

    appears in blue (by default), as shown in [Figure 13-49](ch13s02.html#after_creating_the_outline

    on the object to extract” is now displayed in the mode bar of the Image window,
    and the mouse pointer is that of the Paintbrush tool. Next, paint roughly over
    the cat in one continuous stroke to select it, as shown in [Figure 13-50](ch13s02.html#marking_the_cat_as_the_foreground_object
    "Figure 13-50. Marking the cat as the foreground object"). When you release the
    mouse pointer after your first stroke, the message in the Image window will read
    “Add more strokes or press Enter to accept the selection.” Our result, at this
    stage, is shown in [Figure 13-51](ch13s02.html#new_selection "Figure 13-51. The
    new selection"). If you haven’t selected the cat completely, continue to paint

    continue the existing path or build a *disjointed path*, a single path that looks

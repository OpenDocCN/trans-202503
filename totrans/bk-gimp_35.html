Thus, this appendix will be rather short, and if you run into trouble, you will find help on the websites mentioned in <a class="xref" href="apc.html" title="Appendix C. Resources">Appendix C</a>. The official GIMP website (<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.gimp.org/">http://www.gimp.org/</a></em></span>) is the best way to obtain instructions for downloading and installing GIMP and its components.</p><p>Although the GPL license does not forbid the selling of GIMP distributions, buying a commercial distribution of GIMP is useless and possibly even harmful: It will have no added value other than some elaborate packaging, and some commercial distributions are known to contain viruses. Do not download GIMP from sites that are not the official GIMP site or that are not directly pointed to by the GIMP website.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="E.1 GNU/Linux and Unix"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="edot1_gnusoliduslinux_and_unix"/>E.1 GNU/Linux and Unix</h1></div></div></div><p>GIMP was initially designed for GNU/Linux, and most of its developers work on this operating system. Therefore, installing it on this system is especially easy. Moreover, the main GNU/Linux distributions provide automated tools for installing GIMP (if it’s not already installed by default). Of course, if your distribution was installed some months ago, and you do not regularly update it, most likely the version of GIMP on your system is not the latest one (i.e., 2.8), so you need to update your software. In most cases, simply updating your installation is enough.</p><div class="sect2" title="Debian"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="debian"/>Debian</h2></div></div></div><p>With Debian, the simple command</p><a id="pro_id00001"/><pre class="programlisting">apt-get install gimp</pre><p>run as the <code class="literal">root</code> user installs GIMP and all its dependencies.

This experience can be painful, although all this software is free and the source text freely available. Go to <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.gimp.org/downloads/">http://www.gimp.org/downloads/</a></em></span> and follow the instructions. Choose a mirror site near your location: This way you avoid overloading the main website and increase your download speed.</p></div></div>
<div class="sect1" title="E.2 Windows"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="edot2_windows"/>E.2 Windows</h1></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle3758" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle6064" class="indexterm"/>Although most GIMP developers are users of GNU/Linux, they know that the outside world is still dominated by various versions of the Windows operating system. As explained on <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.gimp.org/windows/">http://www.gimp.org/windows/</a></em></span>, Jernej Simončič contributed a GIMP installer for Windows and updates it for every new version. From the website <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/stable.html">http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/stable.html</a></em></span>, you can download the package and install it immediately. It contains everything you will need and installs smoothly on Windows XP SP2 and later versions. The installation process is similar to that of most applications and is not detailed here. Once GIMP is installed, download and install any additional plug-ins from the GIMP Plugin Registry (<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://registry.gimp.org/">http://registry.gimp.org/</a></em></span>).</p><p>Beware, however, that the online help is a separate package, available in several languages. We also recommend that, if you already have a previous version of GIMP installed, you first uninstall it before trying to install GIMP 2.8.</p><p>If you perform these simple actions correctly, you should not encounter problems. Of course, the Windows desktop environment is different from the various available GNU/Linux environments, and it is generally less convenient for using GIMP. With Windows, you do not have the advantage of several workspaces, which means all windows are on the same screen, and handling several applications at the same time, or even a single application with several windows, can be cumbersome.</p><p>Windows users will probably prefer the single-window mode GIMP interface, described in <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. The GIMP Interface">Chapter 9</a>. This does not mean that the multi-window interface is not available, but Windows users will have to change some of their habits to use it. Moreover, such an interface is handy only if you can change the window manager’s behavior so a window becomes active as soon as your mouse pointer is on it. Having to click twice every time you change from the Toolbox to the Image window (one click activates the window; the second click triggers the intended action) can be very annoying.</p><p>Do not try to use GIMP on Windows versions previous to Windows XP SP2. And don’t forget that installing a GNU/Linux distribution on your computer, in addition to Windows, is easy, as is sharing the same data with the two operating systems.

<div class="sect1" title="E.3 Mac OS X"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="edot3_mac_os_x"/>E.3 Mac OS X</h1></div></div></div><p>The number of GIMP developers using OS X is still less than the number using Windows. But the websites <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gimp/v2.8/osx/gimp-2.8.2-dmg-2.dmg">ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gimp/v2.8/osx/gimp-2.8.2-dmg-2.dmg</a></em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://gimp.lisanet.de/">http://gimp.lisanet.de/</a></em></span> offer OS X users good tools for installing GIMP as easily as on Windows. It’s no longer necessary to first install the X11 environment. Do not install GIMP on an older version of Mac OS.</p><p>As with Windows, the GIMP help is in a separate package, but it is available only in English, German, Spanish, and French.</p><p>Other interface problems, due to the Mac interface, have all been solved recently, and GIMP on the Mac now behaves in exactly the same way as on other operating systems. Even the menu bar uses the GIMP style, not the Mac style, so the top bar on your screen will not be very useful. Mac users will probably prefer the single-window mode interface for the same reasons that Windows users do.</p></div></body></html>

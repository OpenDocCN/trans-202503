<p class="noindent">Frank pushed himself into a crouch and hurried to the door. He tugged and pulled, rattling and thumping the door against its lock. He grasped the rusted iron bars and threw his full weight into the effort, but succeeded only in producing louder clanking sounds.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank turned to Socks, hoping the young wizard knew a bar-bending spell. Given the circumstances, he felt confident that Socks would even consent to using a lock-picking spell. But as Frank’s eye caught the smoldering stacks of parchment and the trails of smoke wisping to the ceiling, he froze. An image of a smoke-filled kitchen flashed across his mind, dredging up forgotten memories of his first year in the academy. He could almost hear the cook shouting. Frank shut his eyes hard, trying to force the memory away.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">During his first two months at the academy, Frank had balanced his classes with a work-study job in the school cafeteria. The job wasn’t anything glamorous; they didn’t let new arrivals wash dishes, let alone prepare the food. Instead, Frank spent 15 hours a week transporting loads of clean trays, plates, and cutlery from the kitchen to the appropriate locations in the cafeteria.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_94"/><img src="../images/f0094-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Despite the tedious nature of the work, Frank found himself enjoying it. “Look at me! I’m undoing your work. I’m the anti-busboy,” he would shout to the trio of busboys clearing tables and filling bins with dirty dishes. He unsuccessfully tried to break the school record for the most number of dishes transported in two minutes. He created an entirely new cafeteria game called Fling the Spoon. But it wasn’t until a fortuitous run-in with Professor Heappens that he actually learned something from the job.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Ugh. There are some data structures that just don’t belong in the cafeteria,” Professor Heappens muttered loudly as he studied the food options.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">At 2:30 in the afternoon, the lunch rush had vanished, and Frank Runtime was hard at work transporting a load of bowls to the soup station. Though the comment wasn’t directed at him, he found himself asking the professor, “What data structures?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Stacks,” Professor Heappens said, looking up at Frank. “Stacks almost never belong in a cafeteria.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Sure they do,” Frank replied with the level of certainty that only new students and the truly ignorant can muster. He nodded down <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_95"/>at the stack of bowls he was carrying. “Stacks of bowls. Stacks of plates. Stacks of pancakes.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Professor Heappens made a dismissive gesture and started walking away. “What do you know about data structures anyway?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“How else are you supposed to arrange plates?” Frank asked. “If you laid them out end to end, they would take too much room.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The professor stopped and stared at Frank with an expression of profound concern. After nearly a minute, he asked, “Do you know the difference between a stack and a queue?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank shook his head. He hadn’t taken Police Data Structures yet.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“A stack is a <em>last-in, first-out</em> data structure,” explained the professor. “It has two operations. You can <em>push</em> something onto the top of the stack. Or you can <em>pop</em> something off the top of the stack.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">He gestured at the stack of plates waiting at the front of the line. “It’s just like the stack of plates over there. You can push a plate onto the stack.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">He placed his empty plate on top of the stack.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0095-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Or you can pop a plate off the top.” He grabbed his plate back.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0095-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">“And whenever you pop something off a stack, you get the newest item on the stack. The oldest item will stay at the bottom of the stack until you have popped off everything above it.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“So?” Frank asked. “What’s wrong with that?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_96"/>“Nothing’s wrong with a last-in, first-out data structure if you use it correctly. Stacks are wonderful if you are writing a depth-first search; you just keep pushing new search options onto the stack and popping them off when you backtrack. But cafeterias have misused stacks for decades!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Take this stack of plates right here. Do you know how long the bottom plate has been there?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank tried to recall the last time he had seen the stack empty, but couldn’t even conjure the image.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Five years!” shouted Professor Heappens. “I know, because I marked it. For five years that bottom plate has sat there unused, while students like yourself dump other clean plates on top. It sits there collecting dust around the edges.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“But that isn’t even the worst. Look at what they are doing to the mashed potatoes!”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank glanced over at the large wooden bowl of mashed potatoes. A cook was in the process of refilling it. He held a large pot in one hand and was gleefully ladling fresh mashed potatoes into the bowl. It took a moment for Frank to realize the older food was simply being buried. His stomach turned.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“How long?” he croaked, not really wanting to know the answer.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Don’t worry. They wash out the serving bowl at least once a week, so the old mashed potatoes are less than a week old.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank didn’t feel reassured. In fact, he felt rather ill. A quick scan of the cafeteria showed the last-in, first-out pattern being utilized everywhere. He stopped when he reached the vats of salad dressing, his stomach roiling with a mixture of nausea and panic.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What can we do?” he asked.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Queues,” responded the professor. “Queues were practically designed for cafeterias.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Queues?” asked Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“First-in, first-out data structures,” explained Professor Heappens. “Like stacks, they also store things and have two operations. You can <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_97"/><em>enqueue</em> something by adding it to the back of the queue. Or you can <em>dequeue</em> something by taking it from the front. That way, you are always taking out the oldest item.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank tried to picture always taking the bottom plate from a stack. “But how?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“That’s just how the data structure works. Look at the sandwich line; it’s a queue. Right now it has four people in it, and the person at the front has been waiting the longest.”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0097-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Even as Professor Heappens said that, another person joined the line. “See, they enqueue at the back!” he noted.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0097-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">They stood watching the line until the person at the front received her sandwich and departed.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0097-03.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">“And dequeue at the front,” said the professor happily. “What this cafeteria needs is more queues. Every cafeteria needs more queues.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_98"/>Frank thought back to the mashed potato stack and realized the professor was right. How the data was stored could have a significant impact on how it was accessed. In cases like mashed potatoes, order mattered.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Despite the seemingly simple revelation, Frank struggled for days to integrate queues into the cafeteria. The plates and bowls were relatively easy. He would simply lift the old pile up and slide new plates underneath. Convincing the cooks to change how they ladled food proved more difficult. They thoroughly enjoyed ladling giant spoonfuls of potatoes, smiling as the large gobs smacked down into the bowl. Frank ultimately suggested a two-bowl method where the old potatoes were ladled onto the top of the new bowl. While it wasn’t strictly a queue, it preserved all the fun of slopping mashed potatoes, and the old food didn’t get buried at the bottom.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, disaster struck when he filled in for a sick baker. Not paying attention to the fact that the bread was baked in batches for a reason, Frank insisted that loading the oven last-in, first-out was unfair to the bread at the back. He devised a rotation scheme that, every 25 seconds, inserted a new loaf, rotated all the loaves in the oven, and removed the oldest loaf.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank’s attempt at a baking queue might have worked if the oven had two doors, one at the front and one at the back. Unfortunately, the cafeteria used an older, single-door model, which made rotating the loaves in and out extremely difficult. While the constant churn ensured a more consistent cooking time for all loaves, Frank found himself unable to keep up with the schedule. Soon, dense smoke poured from the hearth as the loaves blackened.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As the other cooks dashed to the fire with buckets of water, Frank stared numbly at the charred loaves. A sense of hopeless confusion crept in as he realized that queues might not be the solution to <em>every</em> cafeteria problem. He still had a lot to learn about data structures.</p>&#13;

<p class="sidebart"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_99"/><strong>POLICE ALGORITHMS 101: STACKS AND QUEUES</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="sbsub"><em><strong>Excerpt from Professor Drecker’s Lecture</strong></em></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Stacks and queues are two simple structures for storing data. At first glance, both data structures resemble nothing more than lists of values. How these two data structures differ, though, is in how data is inserted or removed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A stack is a last-in, first-out data structure that operates much like the pile of papers you’ll find on every officer’s desk. New elements are <em>pushed</em> onto the top of the stack, and elements are removed by being <em>popped</em> off the top of the stack. If five elements are pushed onto an empty stack in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, they will be popped off in the reverse order, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Of course, as soon as your pile of papers is gone, your captain will just give you more paperwork.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can implement stacks using an array and a single variable to track the index corresponding to the top of the stack. When you push a new element onto the stack, you add it to the next open slot in the array: index = top + 1. You also increment the top index accordingly.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0099-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you pop an element off the stack, you can again use the top index to find the correct element. You can then remove this from the array and decrement the top index accordingly.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_100"/><img src="../images/f0100-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Of course, you must be careful when adding elements to an array of fixed size to avoid going past the end of the array.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A queue is a first-in, first-out data structure, much like a line of suspects waiting to be processed. New elements are <em>enqueued</em> at the back of the queue, and elements are removed by being <em>dequeued</em> from the front. If five elements are enqueued in an empty queue in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, they will be dequeued in the same order, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Queues can also be implemented with arrays. In this case, you need to track two indexes—the first and last element in the queue. When you enqueue a new element, you add it behind the current last element and increment the back index.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0100-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">And when you dequeue an element, you remove the front element and increment the front index accordingly.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_101"/><img src="../images/f0101-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">As you enqueue and dequeue elements in a fixed array, a block of empty space will build up at the front of the array. While you can design the queue to wrap, you must take care during both enqueuing and dequeuing to handle indexes being incremented past the end of the array.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_102"/></p>&#13;

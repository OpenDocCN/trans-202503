- en: There are so many people who have helped make this book a reality in small and
    large ways. Throughout my career, I’ve had mentors who have guided me and pushed
    me to become better at my craft. There’s nothing more rewarding than working with
    someone who is smarter than you are, so go find people who make you feel stupid
    in comparison. Try to glean anything you can from them. Look at their code, ask
    dumb questions, and you’ll improve.

  zh: 有很多人以不同大小的方式帮助使这本书成为现实。在我的职业生涯中，我有许多导师，他们引导我并推动我不断提升自己的技艺。没有什么比与比自己更聪明的人共事更有成就感了，所以去找那些让你觉得自己相形见绌的人吧。从他们身上汲取任何你能学到的东西。看看他们的代码，问一些傻问题，你会有所进步。
- en: I’d like to thank everyone who has supported me in my Nandland pursuits—those
    who have liked, commented, or subscribed to videos on my YouTube channel; purchased
    a Go Board; or supported my Patreon. You’ve built up my confidence and helped
    me stay motivated to keep cranking out FPGA content for years and years.

- en: I never imagined that writing a book would be as lengthy a process as it turned
    out to be. Many thanks to my editor, Nathan Heidelberger, who has had the biggest
    impact on the quality of this book. Nathan doesn’t have an engineering background,
    but he was able to give me valuable feedback from an outsider’s perspective when
    concepts were unclear. Similarly, I’m grateful to my technical reviewer, Mike
    D. Smith, a coworker and friend from my BAE Systems days. His attention to the
    technical explanations ensured that this book would be accessible and, equally
    importantly, accurate.

  zh: 我从未想过写一本书会是如此漫长的过程。非常感谢我的编辑Nathan Heidelberger，他对本书质量的提升起到了最大的影响。Nathan虽然没有工程背景，但他能够从外部的角度给我提供宝贵的反馈，尤其是在某些概念不清晰的时候。同样，我也很感激我的技术审稿人Mike
    D. Smith，他是我在BAE Systems时的同事和朋友。他对技术解释的关注确保了本书既易于理解，又准确无误。
- en: Finally, I’d like to thank my family for allowing me the (significant) time
    required to write this book. Many nights and weekends have been impacted, so to
    my wife, Christine, I would like to say thank you for always being supportive
    and encouraging. I couldn’t have done this without your help.

- en: 'The key to understanding how parametric modeling software works is in its name:
    with parametric modeling, you define every single feature by a collection of characteristics
    called parameters. For example, a simple cube is constructed by defining variables
    like its origin, height, width, and depth. Those dimensions are simply the parameters
    that the software uses to describe the cube. You can then use the software to
    save all of those parameters and then edit or reference them later.'

- en: Using parameter-based modeling is very important in engineering for a few reasons.
    The most obvious reason is that when you’re designing a physical part for the
    real world, you need to define its dimensions exactly. For example, you can’t
    rely on visual estimates to design a piston that fits into an engine. Instead,
    you need to explicitly define the piston’s exact size and shape through specified
    dimensions—the parameters that make up your model.

- en: The building blocks of parametric modeling are called *features*. Individual
    features are often just primitive polygons—basic shapes that you put together
    with other features to end up with a complex part. One of the fundamental skills
    you’ll learn as a designer is how to break the complex part you envision into
    a series of basic features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That process of breaking a component, such as the one shown in [Figure 2-1](ch02.xhtml#ch02fig1),
    into individual features is a task that each person will approach differently.
    There isn’t necessarily a right or wrong approach. Two designers might end up
    with the exact same part using a completely different series of features. Of course,
    best practices for efficient modeling do exist.

- en: If you’re a beginner at parametric modeling, you might be tempted to try to
    use as few features as possible, but that approach generally isn’t ideal. Individual
    features will end up being overly complex, and might contain mistakes that can
    be hard to find and difficult to modify later. However, the opposite is also true—creating
    a series of very simple features can be time consuming and inefficient. A balance
    between complexity and efficiency is best.

    With practice and experience, you’ll learn how to break down an intricate part
    into a series of features that follow a logical plan. Which path you choose to
    follow is up to you as a designer, but the key is to take your time and make a
    plan.

    an idea of what you wanted the spaceship to look like. But how you actually built
    that spaceship was completely up to you. Now, let’s say your friend came along
    and decided he wanted to build his own spaceship that looked just like yours.
    Just because he was able to do so doesn’t mean he got there the same way. He could
    have used a completely different set of bricks and still ended up with a spaceship
    that had the same final size and shape.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can think of features in parametric modeling software like those individual
    LEGO bricks. The bricks come in all different sizes, shapes, and styles, and you
    can use them for many purposes. In parametric modeling software, one feature can
    be used to create a basic cube, while another might be used to cut a hole through
    that cube. Still another could be used to round the edges and corners.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every feature you’ll work with is defined by at least one parameter, such as
    the depth of a cut. Most features will have numerous parameters that either you
    set explicitly or the software generates for later use. On many features, like
    the Extrude shown in [Figure 2-2](ch02.xhtml#ch02fig2), you’ll use parameters
    in conjunction with *sketches*, which are 2D drawings that are used to make 3D
    shapes or to define locations or paths.

<p class="INTRO">I wrote this book for those who know the basics of working with the Arduino microcontroller environment but are hungry for more. Perhaps you’ve built the projects in <i>Arduino Workshop</i>, my first Arduino book for beginners, or some other introductory book. You know how to use data buses, control small motors, work with data from various sensors, and do much more. But there’s much more to learn, and you’re ready for more challenging projects.</p>
<p class="TX">In this book, you’ll continue your journey into the world of Arduino-based learning and fun. Each chapter contains detailed tutorials on advanced techniques and tools you may have heard about but not yet tried, complete with instructions to build 70 complex and useful projects. I’ve chosen these topics based on the skills I’ve found most valuable during <span aria-label=" Page xx. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xx" role="doc-pagebreak"/>years of helping others create fun, useful, and innovative Arduino-based circuits and products.</p>

<h2 class="H1" id="sec1"><span id="h1-1"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Who Is This Book For?</samp></h2>
<p class="TNI">This book is for those with intermediate-level Arduino experience who are ready to expand their skill set. You may have completed the introductory examples that come with Arduino starter kits, worked through a basic book on building Arduino projects, or taken a basic college-level computer engineering class that used an Arduino.</p>
<p class="TX">You might want to use this book as a reference to construct your own project ideas, or you might simply want to learn a range of new skills. If you’re interested in improving power efficiency, interfacing with older devices using common data buses, logging data from your projects to online or offline storage, controlling projects over the internet, and more, this is the book for you.</p>
<p class="TX">To allow as many people as possible to complete this book, I’ve minimized the cost of building each project. You can easily purchase all required parts from a wide variety of retailers online.</p>

<h2 class="H1" id="sec2"><span id="h1-2"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">What Can You Expect to Learn?</samp></h2>
<p class="TNI">In each chapter of this book, I introduce a set of new concepts or tools and then teach you how to implement them in a total of 70 entertaining and educational projects. I hope these spur your creative imagination and become a reference for your own future work.</p>
<p class="TX">In general, you don’t need to read sequentially, building the projects in one chapter before moving to the next one; instead, you can drop into any chapter you find interesting or useful. <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter19.xhtml">Chapters 19</a></span> and onward cover internet-connected projects, so it’s simplest to read these sequentially, but it’s not a requirement. When any chapter relies on content covered in a previous chapter, I provide the necessary references so you can go back and learn the required skills.

<h2 class="H1" id="sec3"><span id="h1-3"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">What I Expect You to Know</samp></h2>
<p class="TNI">As this is an intermediate-level book, I expect you already know how to make a range of Arduino-based projects, from the simple to the more involved. You should also be familiar with writing your own Arduino sketches and uploading them to your board.</p>
<p class="TX">You should be able to understand circuit schematics to construct the circuits for each project. When describing connections to an Arduino or <span aria-label=" Page xxiii. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxiii" role="doc-pagebreak"/>compatible board, instead of showing the entire board, a schematic uses labels to represent the Arduino pins to which connections should be made. For example, consider the schematic shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>.</p>
<figure class="IMG"><img alt="A SCREENSHOT OF AN EXAMPLE CIRCUIT SCHEMATIC" class="img5" id="fig1" src="../images/fig1.png"/>
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 1: An example schematic</samp></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="TX">The Arduino’s pin D11 is connected to R3, Arduino D10 to R4, and Arduino D9 to R5, with the LED’s cathodes terminating at GND, which is connected to the Arduino’s GND pin. Using schematics throughout this book will also improve your ability to read complex circuits.</p>
<p class="TX">Finally, be prepared to take appropriate safety measures for your workstation. For the projects in this book, you’ll work with basic hand tools, battery-powered electrical devices, sharp knives, cutters, soldering irons, and more. As with any hobby or craft, it’s up to you to take care of yourself and those around you.</p>
<p class="Warning"><span class="NoteHead"><samp class="SANS_Dogma_OT_Bold_B_21">WARNING</samp></span></p>
<p class="NOTE-TXT"><i>At no point in your projects should you work directly with the mains current. Leave that to a licensed electrician who is trained for such work. Contacting the mains current will kill you.</i></p>
<p class="TX">If you need help or have any compliments or brickbats about the content of this book, please contact me via the publisher’s website at <a href="https://nostarch.com/contactus"><i>https://<wbr/>nostarch<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/contactus</i></a>.</p>

<p class="TNI">To complete the projects in this book, you’ll need up-to-date Arduino IDE software and various hardware parts and accessories, including a few printed circuit boards.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec5" epub:type="division">
<h3 class="H2" id="sec5"><span id="h2-1"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Arduino IDE and Sketch Files</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI">If you haven’t already done so, download and install the latest version of the Arduino IDE software. You can find versions for Windows 10 and newer, macOS 10.14 64-bit and newer, and Linux (Ubuntu or similar) from <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software"><i>https://<wbr/>www<wbr/>.arduino<wbr/>.cc<wbr/>/en<wbr/>/software</i></a>. The IDE has been a work in progress since 2005 and is currently up to version 2.<i>x</i> (the exact number may change, but the instructions in this book should still work). If you’re still using an older IDE, update to the latest version.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page xxiv.

<h3 class="H2" id="sec6"><span id="h2-2"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Parts and Accessories</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI">As with any other electronic device, the Arduino is available from many retailers offering a range of products and accessories. When shopping for a microcontroller, please purchase an original Arduino or a quality derivative—otherwise you run the risk of receiving faulty or poorly performing goods. Why risk buying an inferior board that could end up costing you more in the long run? For a list of genuine Arduino suppliers, visit <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Buy"><i>http://<wbr/>arduino<wbr/>.cc<wbr/>/en<wbr/>/Main<wbr/>/Buy<wbr/>.</i></a></p>
<p class="TX">All the parts required for projects are listed in their respective chapters. I recommend these suppliers (listed in alphabetical order) for your purchases of Arduino-related parts and accessories:</p>
<p class="RunInPara1"><b>Altronics (Australia)</b> <a href="https://altronics.com.au"><i>https://<wbr/>altronics<wbr/>.com<wbr/>.au</i></a></p>
<p class="RunInPara"><b>Arduino Store USA</b> <a href="https://store-usa.arduino.cc"><i>https://<wbr/>store<wbr/>-usa<wbr/>.arduino<wbr/>.cc</i></a></p>

<section aria-labelledby="sec7" epub:type="division">
<h3 class="H2" id="sec7"><span id="h2-3"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Project PCBs</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI">It’s possible to assemble all projects in this book using one or more solderless breadboards, which may also require some external soldering to other devices. For example, in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a></span>, you’ll build a wireless AC outlet remote controller with the interface circuit on a solderless breadboard. However, for certain projects, such as the 30-LED matrix display in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a></span>, ordering printed circuit boards (PCBs) will make your projects more reliable and easier to build. This also gives you a more permanent example of your efforts.</p>
<p class="TX">After you download and extract this book’s files from the No Starch website, you’ll find a group of ZIP files, each with a project number. Each project’s ZIP file contains a group of files called Gerbers, which PCB manufacturers use to control the machines that shape and drill blank PCBs into the desired configuration.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page xxv. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxv" role="doc-pagebreak"/>You can view the PCBs by using a Gerber viewer tool such as <a href="https://www.gerblook.org"><i>https://<wbr/>www<wbr/>.gerblook<wbr/>.org</i></a>. Simply upload your Gerber ZIP file, and the tool should display the front and back of the PCB along with the other layers of interest, as shown in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>.</p>
<figure class="IMG"><img alt="A SCREENSHOT OF USING THE GERBLOOK WEBSITE TO VIEW RENDERS OF THE PCB FOR PROJECT #19" class="img1" id="fig2" src="../images/fig2.png"/>
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 2: Using an online Gerber viewer to display the PCB for Project #19</samp></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="TX">Let’s go through the process for ordering PCBs. You don’t have to order all the PCBs for the book at once, but note that the turnaround time can be two to three weeks.</p>
<p class="TX">First, visit your preferred PCB manufacturer. I’ve found success with the following (listed in alphabetical order):</p>
<p class="RunInPara1"><b>JLCPCB</b> <a href="https://jlcpcb.com"><i>https://<wbr/>jlcpcb<wbr/>.com</i></a></p>
<p class="RunInPara"><b>OSH Park</b> <a href="https://oshpark.com"><i>https://<wbr/>oshpark<wbr/>.com</i></a></p>
<p class="RunInPara2"><b>PCB Way</b> <a href="https://pcbway.com"><i>https://<wbr/>pcbway<wbr/>.com</i></a></p>
<p class="TX">You might use JLCPCB if you’re looking to save money. I’ve found that OSH Park, based in the United States, has high-quality PCBs, and PCB Way sells good-quality items at reasonable prices. This is by no means an exhaustive list, just three companies that I’ve used with success over the years.</p>
<p class="TX">The manufacturer website you choose will generally have a Quote Now or Quick Order button on the front page. Clicking that should lead you to an Add Gerber File button. For example, <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> shows a screenshot of that page on the PCB Way website.<span aria-label=" Page xxvi. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxvi" role="doc-pagebreak"/></p>
<figure class="IMG"><img alt="A SCREENSHOT OF UPLOADING THE PCB GERBER FILES TO THE PCB MANUFACTURER’S WEBSITE" class="img1" id="fig3" src="../images/fig3.png"/>
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 3: Uploading Gerbers to PCB factory</samp></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="TX">Click <b>Add Gerber File</b>, navigate to your required ZIP file, and click <b>Open</b> or <b>OK</b> to upload the ZIP file to the factory website. (You don’t need to decompress the individual project ZIP files before uploading them, as the manufacturers can accept them without modification.) Once you upload your ZIP, the site should show you your PCB’s top and bottom sides, along with the measurements and potentially an initial price estimate, as shown in <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>. In general, the cost of a PCB can range from US$10 for smaller projects to US$40 or so for the larger ones.</p>
<figure class="IMG"><img alt="A SCREENSHOT OF AN EXAMPLE PCB PRICE AND FREIGHT QUOTE" class="img1" id="fig4" src="../images/fig4.png"/>
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 4: An example of a PCB price and freight quote displayed after uploading PCB ZIP files</samp></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="TX">Once you see the image of the PCB you’re in the process of ordering, scroll down to find many design options to choose from, as shown in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>.<span aria-label=" Page xxvii. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxvii" role="doc-pagebreak"/></p>
<figure class="IMG"><img alt="A SCREENSHOT OF SELECTING PCB TYPE OPTIONS ON THE PCB MANUFACTURER’S WEBSITE" class="img1" id="fig5" src="../images/fig5.png"/>
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 5: Selecting PCB options</samp></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="TX">Don’t panic—you only need to worry about a few of these options. You can change the following to suit your needs:</p>
<p class="RunInPara1"><b>Quantity</b>    PCB factories will generally have a minimum quantity of three or five boards, but you can order as many as you like.</p>
<p class="RunInPara"><b>Solder mask</b>    This is the color of the protective coating on both sides of the PCB. Generally, the default color is green, but you can change this to suit your tastes or needs.</p>
<p class="RunInPara"><span aria-label=" Page xxviii. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxviii" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>Silkscreen</b>    This is the color of the text printed on top of the solder mask, such as the board’s labels or titles. Again, change this to suit your preferences.</p>
<p class="RunInPara2"><b>Surface finish</b>    By default, the factory will generally use a lead-based process, which has been the standard for decades. If you prefer a lead-free environment or are having the boards delivered to a country that requires lead-free PCBs, you can change the surface finish to HASL lead-free or immersion gold.</p>
<p class="TX">Once you’ve made your selections or left them as the default, click <b>Next</b> or <b>Calculate</b> to see the final price. The website should also offer various delivery options, from cheap post to air courier, as shown in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>. Save your PCB to your cart and then complete the last few steps for payment and delivery.</p>

</figure>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page xxix. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxix" role="doc-pagebreak"/>You should receive a set of nicely machined PCBs like those shown in <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>.</p>

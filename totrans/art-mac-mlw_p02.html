<p class="PartIntro">Now that you understand Mac malware’s infection vectors, persistence mechanisms, and capabilities, let’s discuss how you can effectively analyze malicious samples. We’ll cover both static and dynamic approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Static Analysis:</b> The examination of a sample without executing it. This approach leverages various tools that can statically extract information from a sample. Often, the analysis culminates with the use of a disassembler or decompiler.</li>
<li><b>Dynamic Analysis:</b> The examination of a sample during its execution. This approach most commonly leverages passive monitoring tools, though it might employ more powerful tools, such as a debugger, as well. </li>
</ul>
<p>Using these analysis techniques, we’ll determine whether a sample is indeed malicious and, if so, answer questions such as the following: What infection vector does it use to infect a Mac? What, if any, persistence mechanism is used to maintain access? What are its ultimate objectives and capabilities?</p>
<p>With the answers to these questions, we can determine exactly what threat the malware poses to Mac users, as well as create detection, prevention, and disinfection mechanisms to thwart it.</p>

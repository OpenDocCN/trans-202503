    2005\. The mobile team was created to make the company’s services available on
    existing mobile devices, and brought in Debajit to lead the server-side team.
    “The first project I was working on was trans-coding traditional web pages into
    what could be viewed on the really cruddy browsers you’d have on cell phones at
    that time.” The browser application on the phone would make a request to view
    a website. The content from that site would come down to the Google servers, get
    translated into something that that very limited phone device could handle, and
    that simpler version of the site would be sent down to the phone. This was similar
    to the approach that Danger used for its Hiptop phone browser years earlier, and
    WebTV for its TV browser years before that, with a server translating between
    what web pages actually looked like and what was possible to display on an actual
    device.

- en: During his time at Danger, Michael worked on back-end services, connecting applications
    on the phone to data on Danger servers and to the internet in general. “I loved
    server-side stuff, so I started building out the backend, and the protocol between
    the device and the server.” For example, Danger phone users had many different
    kinds of email services they needed to connect to. Rather than handle all of those
    services locally on the device, the Danger servers would connect to those various
    email services and translate the results into a single protocol that Danger devices
    understood. Similarly, the browser worked by having the servers translate full
    web pages into simplified representations that were sent down to the phone.

  zh: 在Danger工作的期间，Michael负责后端服务，将手机上的应用程序与Danger服务器上的数据以及互联网进行连接。“我喜欢服务器端的工作，于是我开始构建后端和设备与服务器之间的协议。”例如，Danger手机用户需要连接许多不同种类的电子邮件服务。Danger服务器不会将这些服务都本地化到设备上，而是通过服务器连接这些不同的电子邮件服务，并将结果翻译成Danger设备能够理解的单一协议。同样，浏览器也是通过服务器将完整的网页翻译成简化版，并发送到手机上。
- en: One of the innovations at Danger was a persistent connection between a device
    and the servers. Through this connection, a device would get new email or messages
    immediately. This was huge back in 2002\. Even if you had one of the few phones
    at that time with email capability, those devices typically required you to synchronize
    them manually with your computer. So you would get that message about the meeting
    you needed to attend an hour after it ended. But on Danger phones, you would know
    that you were missing the meeting as it was happening.

    to create Microsoft phones. At the time, Microsoft licensed their OS to manufacturers
    like HTC. But someone at Microsoft envisioned a future where the company would

    case was not the point of the phone and the very limited device was ill-equipped
    to take on that additional burden. Through meetings like this and various other

    had the kind of domain knowledge of the mobile industry, but not the Google knowledge,
    that wouldn’t be good because it would take them forever to get through the Google

    wanted to ‘tickle’ the device. We came up with terms like Light Tickle, letting
    the device know that something’s changed, please sync. Heavy tickle: including

    new information on the server. Each application had its own specific requirements
    for data, but they all shared this single connection through which the server
    would alert the device that something changed. The connection was also used for

    Android needed. At that time, Google worked on the assumption that everything
    needing a network connection was web-based; data transfer requests used standard
    web HTTP request mechanisms. But Android needed to use a completely different
    protocol, so they required a dedicated network resource called a Virtual IP (VIP).
    The problem was, the network team didn’t want to give them one. “The way that
    Google was built, for a whole bunch of boring reasons that I won’t go into, these
    were extremely rare. There was literally only capacity for only about 200 of them.
    A bunch of them were used, and the network team would not give them out at all.”

    for as long as there had been Hiptops and was a big fan. And I was a fan of mobile
    computing. I was that guy with the weird little mini-PC and radio system that
    could get on the internet from anywhere, back when it was super crazy to do that.
    I was an enthusiast in early Wi-Fi and related technologies, back when that was
    so novel there were user groups that you would go to and talk with other Wi-Fi
    enthusiasts about how this was going to change everything.” So he was intrigued
    about what was happening in the Android group.

    devices needed to talk to those servers so they needed experts to create the software
    to do it. The timing was right and Dan joined the team in August of 2007, three
    months before the SDK was released and a year before the 1.0 launch.

    Michael Morrissey, plus engineers Debajit Ghosh, Malcolm Handley, and Fred Quintana.
    The other three engineers were focused on data synchronization plus the specific
    details of the applications that they were working with (Calendar, Gmail, and
    Contacts, respectively). Dan helped out with some of that stuff, and core infrastructure
    for services overall, but he mainly took responsibility for what they called Device
    Management. This work included Over the Air updates as well as the check-in service.
    There was already a basic update mechanism, but Dan rewrote it into the system
    that Android used when it launched.

    the grizzled old hand—I mean, he’s no older than I am—with the voice of wisdom.
    He had managed similar things at Danger, he had seen a lot of shit go down, and
    definitely had wise wisdom, in terms of what to pay attention to, what to focus
    on, what architectures were likely to work, what could be a pain point. He remembered
    many times when the ability to just push an OTA to fix some problem saved that
    company’s bacon. So this was going to be really important: if you’ve got something
    out there not behaving well, you can quickly ship a fix. Or if there’s some security
    issue, it’s important to have a very quick turnaround OTA thing. We do not want
    to leave this in the hands of carriers if we can avoid it.”'

    Danger 管理过类似的事情，见识过很多复杂的情况，确实有着非常智慧的经验，知道该关注什么、该集中精力做什么、哪些架构可能有效、哪些可能会成为痛点。他记得很多时候，能够迅速推送
    OTA 更新来解决问题，拯救了公司。所以这非常重要：如果你的设备出现了问题，能够快速发布一个修复补丁。或者如果遇到安全问题，快速的 OTA 解决方案也至关重要。如果可以避免，我们绝对不希望把这个交给运营商。”
- en: Meanwhile, the OTA system itself had to be carefully designed to anticipate
    all of the things that could go wrong, from running out of space on the device,
    to restarting in the middle of an update, to security vulnerability. The team
    thought hard about all of these issues and came up with an architecture that seems
    to have worked so far.

  zh: 同时，OTA 系统本身必须经过精心设计，以预见所有可能出错的情况，从设备存储空间不足、更新过程中重启到安全漏洞。团队对这些问题进行了深思熟虑，提出了一个架构，到目前为止似乎运行得相当顺利。
- en: First of all, the team divided the bits on the device into *system* and *data*.
    The system partition contained the Android platform itself as well as pre-installed
    apps, which was read-only (except for the OTA updates). The rest of the information
    on the device, including downloaded applications, application data, user preferences,
    and account information, was stored in the data partition. This segmentation meant
    that if there was ever some catastrophic problem, the device could do a factory
    reset, blow away the entire data partition, and the phone would at least work.
    The user would have to set up their accounts again and reinstall applications.
    And they might have lost some application-specific data.^([8](#c20-footnote-8))
    But much of the data was safe anyway, because it was either on external SD-card
    storage or up in the cloud.

- en: 'During updates, the read-only system partition would have to be perturbed,
    because that’s where the new bits from the update had to go. The question was:
    how would the update system guarantee that there was enough space available, the
    right bits were being modified, and the updates were able to proceed even in extreme
    circumstances of the phone restarting during update or running out of battery?'
  id: totrans-69
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The solution was to have a series of incremental updates. So rather than treating
    the entire Android system as a single amorphous blob, updates separated the system
    into individual portions that would be dealt with on their own. For example, an
    update might have new bits for the framework, the media stack, and the SMS driver.
    These, then, might reside in different modules which could be handled independently.
    The update system packaged updates for each of these modules, downloading all
    of them prior to starting the update process. The update rebooted and launched
    into the update app, which walked through each of these modules one by one, installing
    each one, verifying that the results were as expected, swapping it in on top of
    the old one, and then proceeding to the next one. If the phone ever died or restarted
    in the middle of the update process, it could pick up where it left off, without
    leaving the system in some unfinished, indeterminate state. “Our goal was, even
    though it said on the screen ‘Do not power off your phone,’ if any number of power
    cycles, battery pulls, whatever happened, it would still eventually arrive at
    a completed, updated state.”

    there is not enough free memory on the device to download the update? Or what
    if the update results in a system size that is too large for the available memory
    and runs out of room mid-update? This was especially a concern on early Android
    devices, where space was at a premium and it was entirely possible for a user
    to have used up most of the available storage space.
  id: totrans-71
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fortunately, the team anticipated this problem. The main strategy to ensure
    that there was enough room for updates was to use the cache. “We had this cache
    partition, set aside for that purpose. It was shared. Applications could put temporary
    data there that was allowed to be deleted. But it mainly existed so the OTA system
    could download into it.” While the cache was ostensibly available for applications
    to use for temporary files, its real purpose was to enable the update system to
    function, so that there was always enough room for updates to download and install.
  id: totrans-72

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, there was always the theoretical possibility that the system might
    run out of room anyway. After all, Android was created to be used by manufacturers
    for all kinds of unpredictable configurations. In that case, maybe an OTA wouldn’t
    be possible; but it still wouldn’t leave the phone in an unusable state. “There
    was some weird thing where the device was full, the cache was full, and nobody
    was deleting that data, then the OTA download might fail. So you might not get
    your OTA, which was bad if it’s critical. But it’s not as bad as an update leaving
    you with a brick.”

- en: The final area to nail down for updates was security. Updates were allowed to
    write to an otherwise read-only partition, so that they could update the core
    operating system on the device. So what’s to stop some malicious software from
    pretending that it is an update and similarly changing the system software?

- en: The approach that Dan and the team used, with the help of Android’s security
    team, was to only allow trusted files to replace those on the system. Update modules
    would each be signed with keys that could be verified by the system as trusted
    by Android. The Security team added another level of protection so that each entire
    update had one more layer of key encryption in addition to that used by each of
    the individual modules. With all of those layers, the system was deemed secure
    and was allowed to ship (and to update).

    aspects of updates, to make sure that there were no problems. He found a discussion
    about it on a hacking forum. “People were interested in hacking their way into
    this phone. One person who was pretty well regarded on the forum said, ‘Give it
    up. Code’s solid. I can read how it works. You’re not going to get past it. Game
    over—look somewhere else.’”

    entire system. So even if there was just a small update to one specific area of
    the platform, updates would still require downloading and installing the entire
    system. That wasn’t a great experience (for users or carriers), due to the size,
    bandwidth, and time required for such large updates.

    as Dan Egnor) implemented delta updates. The system figured out what had changed

    the bits that had changed. The system worked and the team was ready to release
    it into the wild.

    I answer the phone, and I’m like ‘Dan, what’s up?’ He said, ‘First, I want you

    slightly different from the one that HTC (the manufacturer of the G1) had put
    onto the phones. The update mechanism using deltas only worked if the systems
    matched exactly. So when the update was applied on those phones, the system was
    corrupted and the devices were bricked.

    G1s was pretty good for this kind of catastrophic failure. The reason the problem
    was so contained was that the phased-rollout and check-in service mechanisms that
    the team used worked as intended; Dan and Doug were monitoring the updates as
    they rolled out. They detected the problem immediately and put a stop to the update
    until they diagnosed and fixed the problem.

    for mobile devices (other than Danger’s, of course). The iPhone, when it first
    launched, didn’t have updates like this. To update an iPhone, you needed to plug
    it into your Mac, the same as syncing music on an iPod. Nowadays, Over the Air
    updates are just an expectation of our wireless mobile reality. Your phone downloads
    and reconfigures its entire operating system wirelessly and reboots into the new

    Michael telling him, “‘If you’re not careful, your OTA download can brick the
    world.’ He insisted, quite correctly, on having a staged rollout canary^([9](#c20-footnote-9))
    process, where we’ll roll out to internal users first. We’ll have a way to monitor
    that they actually booted back up with their new OS and are still checking in
    with that. We’ll have those plots [real-time graphs of check-in results] so we
    can deliver to internal users, watch it bounce down as they all reboot. Then we’ll
    deliver it to .01 percent of external users, watch the same plot in case there’s
    something weird. Then we’d go from .01 percent to .1 percent to 1 percent to 10
    percent to a rolling ramp, always watching those charts and looking for signals.”

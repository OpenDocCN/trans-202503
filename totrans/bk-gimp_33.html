Like any such list, it is up-to-date as this book goes to press, but six months from now, some sites may have disappeared and new ones may have been created. In all the URLs that follow, the initial <span class="emphasis"><em>http://</em></span> has been omitted.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="C.1 Official GIMP Pages"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="cdot1_official_gimp_pages"/>C.1 Official GIMP Pages</h1></div></div></div><p>Here are the main parts of the official GIMP website.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.gimp.org">www.gimp.org</a></em></span> is the official GIMP site. If you know only one site, it must be this one, especially because it contains links to many other important sites. On the front page, you’ll find news about the latest releases and links to pages where you can download them. The rest of the site contains the major pages mentioned in this section.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.gimp.org">wiki.gimp.org</a></em></span> is the GIMP Developer wiki, a collaborative website about GIMP. It’s intended for developers but helpful to anyone who wants to know about developers’ projects.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://bugs.gimp.org">bugs.gimp.org</a></em></span> is a somewhat esoteric page. It does not explain how to report bugs, but only enumerates the current list of bugs in various versions of GIMP. This page lets you look at the work of the developers and get to know who is working on what. To file a bug, take a look at <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.gimp.org/bugs/">www.gimp.org/bugs/</a></em></span>.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://developer.gimp.org">developer.gimp.org</a></em></span> is about GIMP development. It is not really updated presently, and its main interesting feature is the tutorial about writing a plug-in at <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://developer.gimp.org/writing-a-plug-in/1/">developer.gimp.org/writing-a-plug-in/1/</a></em></span>.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://gui.gimp.org">gui.gimp.org</a></em></span> is a working wiki about the GIMP graphical user interface (GUI). This site explains how the work for this GUI is done and in what direction it is progressing.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://docs.gimp.org">docs.gimp.org</a></em></span>, surprisingly, is not the same as <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.gimp.org/docs/">www.gimp.org/docs/</a></em></span>. In fact, the first link leads to a page that contains links to the manuals of preceding versions, together with the present one, which is currently a work in progress. The second link leads to the current (finished) documentation and can be accessed directly from GIMP itself. It will point to the documentation of version 2.6 until the documentation of version 2.8 is finished. The documentation is currently available in English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Korean, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. For 2.8 it will also include Greek and Japanese.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://registry.gimp.org">registry.gimp.org</a></em></span> is the GIMP Plugin Registry, where all plug-ins and scripts built by GIMP <a id="iddle3073" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle3155" class="indexterm"/>users are filed and available for download. The GIMP Plugin Registry takes the form of a blog, with the most recent entries appearing on the front page. You’ll also find forums, where you can read and leave comments, and most useful of all, a search engine for hunting for a precise plug-in. This website is probably the second most useful site, after <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.gimp.org">www.gimp.org</a></em></span>.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="C.2 Related Official Sites"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="cdot2_related_official_sites"/>C.2 Related Official Sites</h1></div></div></div><p>Here, we mention websites dealing with software projects or similar sites used as frameworks for GIMP or in its construction.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org">www.gnu.org</a></em></span> is the official site of the GNU project. The GNU project is the oldest free software project in the world, and, in fact, this project founded the concept of free software. Initiated in 1983 by Richard M. Stallman, who desired a Unix-like operating system without any constraint regarding its freedom of use, change, and distribution, the project began by building all the necessary components but the kernel. This last has since been supplied by the Linux kernel. The intended GNU kernel, called Hurd, is still in alpha state. Remember that GIMP is an acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.gtk.org">www.gtk.org</a></em></span> is the official site of the GTK+ project. This software was initially the GIMP Toolkit, the widget toolkit used in implementing GIMP. Since its beginning, it has developed to the point of being one of the most important toolkits in GNU/Linux. For example, it is the basis of the GNOME desktop environment and is now object oriented (hence the name GTK+), and it has been ported to other operating systems like Windows and Mac OS X.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.gimp.org/about/COPYING">www.gimp.org/about/COPYING</a></em></span> is the GNU General Public License (GPL), the most widely used license in the world of free software. A software product licensed using the GPL offers the four fundamental freedoms: freedom to run the program for any purpose, freedom to study how the program works and adapt it to your own needs, freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor, and freedom to improve the program and release your improvements to the public so the whole community benefits. Importantly, these freedoms cannot be denied by somebody redistributing the program.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.gegl.org">www.gegl.org</a></em></span> is the official site of the Generic Graphic Library, a graph-based image-processing framework. In the current version of GIMP, images are represented as arrays of pixels. When you edit an image, you change the pixels, and there is no way to return to the unchanged image other than opening a previously saved copy: This is called <span class="emphasis"><em>destructive editing</em></span>. With GEGL, images are represented as graphs, in which the edges are image components and nodes are operations on these components. By changing the structure of the graph, you can perform nondestructive editing. Moreover, this representation offers provisions for representing images in higher bit depth than the current 8 bits. GEGL operations are already usable in GIMP 2.8, but only GIMP 2.10 or 3.0 will fully benefit from the incorporation of GEGL.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="C.3 Tutorials"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="cdot3_tutorials"/>C.3 Tutorials</h1></div></div></div><p>Many tutorial sites are available for GIMP, but their quality varies. Moreover, many are too old to be useful, since they deal with versions of GIMP older than 2.4. Finding a relevant tutorial is mostly a matter of luck. Here are some interesting and generally useful sites.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/">www.gimp.org/tutorials/</a></em></span> offers an interesting set of tutorials, although most of them are several years old. No recent additions have been made.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.ghuj.com">www.ghuj.com</a></em></span> is rather slow and complicated to use, but it contains many tutorials.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.pixel2life.com/tutorials/gimp/">www.pixel2life.com/tutorials/gimp/</a></em></span> is also slow and complex, but it’s supposed to be the largest collection of GIMP tutorials on the Web.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.gimpusers.com/tutorials/">www.gimpusers.com/tutorials/</a></em></span> offers many tutorials, classified in categories.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>gimps.de</em></span> is in English as well as in German and offers tutorials among other content. <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://gimpology.com">gimpology.com</a></em></span> is a large tutorial site that is frequently updated.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.tutorialized.com/tutorials/Gimp/">www.tutorialized.com/tutorials/Gimp/</a></em></span> has a good number of usefully categorized tutorials, especially about photo effects.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://gimpguru.org">gimpguru.org</a></em></span> contains tutorials that are old but good.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://meetthegimp.org">meetthegimp.org</a></em></span> offers video tutorials.</p></div>
<div class="sect1" title="C.4 Communities and Blogs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="cdot4_communities_and_blogs"/>C.4 Communities and Blogs</h1></div></div></div><p>Although several of the GIMP developers have had blogs, only one is presently “active,” at the rate of nine entries in one year: <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.chromecode.com">www.chromecode.com</a></em></span> is the blog of Martin Nordholts, who spends much less time on it than on GIMP. On this blog, he features some of the most spectacular changes he has made to the GIMP graphic interface.</p><p>Other interesting community sites include the following:</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://libregraphicsworld.org">libregraphicsworld.org</a></em></span> is mainly authored by its maintainer, Alexandre Prokoudine, and is organized as a blog. It’s a very interesting website about all graphics applications in the world of free software, with announcements, short tutorials, reviews, and so on. Certainly you should have it in your bookmarks!</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.gimpusers.com">www.gimpusers.com</a></em></span> is a rich site with news, tutorials, and many other features. Beware, however, of its forums, which, for the most part, are simply transcripts of the corresponding mailing lists (see later). If you want to send and read messages on the GIMP users list, for example, use the list directly and avoid the corresponding pseudoforum on this site.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://gimp-brainstorm.blogspot.com">gimp-brainstorm.blogspot.com</a></em></span> is a rather unusual site. Everybody can contribute with an idea about the GIMP user interface, but the contributions can be only graphic. You must keep silent, and you must remain anonymous. These ideas can be used by the GIMP UI redesign team or entirely ignored.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.gimptalk.com">www.gimptalk.com</a></em></span> is another rich site, with news, tutorials, forums, and other resources like brushes, photographs, and plug-ins.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.gimpgallery.net">www.gimpgallery.net</a></em></span> has about the same purpose as the preceding site, but it is slightly more complicated to use.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.graphics-muse.org">www.graphics-muse.org</a></em></span> is the blog of Michael J. Hammel, author of the excellent book <span class="emphasis"><em>The Artist’s Guide to GIMP, 2nd Edition</em></span> (No Starch Press).</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://blog.mmiworks.net/">blog.mmiworks.net/</a></em></span> is the blog of Peter Sikking, principal interaction architect at m+mi works and responsible for the GIMP UI redesign.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.ramonmiranda.com">www.ramonmiranda.com</a></em></span> is the blog of Ramón Miranda. He is the creator of GPS, the Gimp Paint Studio, and a contributor of the new presets in GIMP 2.8.

Take a look at <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.gimp.org/mail_lists.html">www.gimp.org/mail_lists.html</a></em></span> first if you are not familiar with list etiquette.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>GIMP User (<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gimp-user-list">https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gimp-user-list</a></em></span>) is an active mailing list for GIMP users. Despite what the official site states, it is not especially Unix based. You can ask anything you want, but please first look at the documentation as well as the list archives. If your question is well formulated, you will get several useful answers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>GIMP Developer (<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gimp-developer-list">https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gimp-developer-list</a></em></span>) is also an active mailing list.

  zh: 简介
- en: For all its natural beauty, the Earth often creates difficulties in getting
    around. In fact, many of the most magnificent of Earth’s features are also the
    most challenging to traverse. Rivers and mountains aren’t conducive to roadways,
    railways, or other corridors along the ground’s surface. When the topography is
    too wet, steep, treacherous, or prone to disaster, the only way forward is up
    or down. At canyons, valleys, and rivers, our roadways break free from the earth
    using bridges. And at hills, mountains, and shallow waterways, they bore right
    through to the other side. Perhaps because these structures solve such a grand
    but singular problem—creating a path to the other side—bridges and tunnels are
    among the most celebrated human achievements and full of fascinating engineering
    details. They are almost always custom-designed for a specific location, conforming
    to the local topography, geology, and hydrology (not to mention regional architectural
    preferences and styles). So, each bridge and tunnel is distinct with its own individual
    character. Because of their size and importance, these structures often reflect
    that character outward, becoming a symbol of the places they connect.

- en: Much of the infrastructure we rely on day to day is not necessarily picturesque.
    We certainly could build exquisite electrical transmission lines or stunning sanitary
    sewers, but we rarely want to bear the cost. Bridges are different, though. It
    seems that humanity decided if we must clutter up the most scenic parts of the
    landscape with structures, we should at least give them some charm. That’s not
    to say ugly bridges don’t exist in the world, but the physical appearance of bridges
    is often a significant consideration during their design. To an enthusiast of
    constructed works, many are downright breathtaking. There are so many ways to
    span a gap, all singular in function but remarkably different in form. No matter
    how it’s accomplished, there is something magical about a structure that can support
    substantial loads with nothing underneath.

  zh: 我们日常依赖的基础设施不一定是美丽的。我们当然可以建造精致的电力传输线或惊艳的排水管道，但我们很少愿意承担这样的成本。然而，桥梁却是不同的。人类似乎决定，如果我们必须在风景最美的地方建造结构物，至少也应该赋予它们一些魅力。这并不是说世界上没有丑陋的桥梁，但桥梁的外观通常在设计时是一个重要的考虑因素。对于建筑作品的爱好者来说，许多桥梁简直让人屏息。跨越一个空隙的方式有很多，每一种功能相同，但形式却各不相同。无论如何实现，能够支撑巨大负荷且下面没有任何支撑物的结构总是充满了魔力。
- en: One of the simplest structural crossings is the beam bridge. It consists of
    one or more beams (often called girders) resting on piers or abutments below.
    Beam bridges usually can’t span great distances because the girders required would
    be too large. At a certain distance, the beams become so heavy that they can hardly
    support their own weight, let alone the roadway and traffic on top. Beams are
    mainly used for short bridges or in applications that allow for many intermediate
    piers for support. Most bridges used in highway interchanges are of the beam type.
    Although beautiful in their own way, overpasses are usually quite utilitarian.

  zh: 最简单的结构跨越方式之一是梁式桥。它由一根或多根梁（通常称为主梁）支撑在下方的桥墩或支座上。梁式桥通常不能跨越很大的距离，因为所需的主梁会太大。在一定的距离下，梁会变得非常沉重，几乎无法支撑自己的重量，更不用说承载上面的道路和交通了。梁主要用于短桥或需要许多中间桥墩支撑的应用。大多数用于高速公路互通立交的桥梁都是梁式桥。虽然各具美感，但高架桥通常更具实用性。（有关互通立交的详细信息，请参见第3章。）
- en: One way around the challenge of the structural members’ self-weight is to use
    a truss instead of a girder. A truss is an assembly of smaller elements that creates
    a rigid and lightweight structure. This weight reduction allows trusses to span
    greater distances than solid beams. Truss bridges can take many forms. The illustration
    shows a *through truss*, with the road deck on the bottom level and structural
    members above the bridge (as opposed to a *deck truss*, which hides the structural
    members below the road).

  zh: 一个绕过结构构件自重挑战的方法是使用桁架而不是梁。桁架是由较小元素组成的装配体，创造了刚性且轻量的结构。这种重量减轻使得桁架能够跨越比实心梁更大的距离。桁架桥可以有多种形式。示意图显示了一个*通过桁架*，路面在底层，桥上方是结构构件（与*甲板桁架*相对，后者将结构构件隐藏在道路下方）。
- en: 'Another type of bridge takes advantage of a structural feature that has been
    around for millennia: the arch. Most materials are stronger against forces along
    their axis than those applied at right angles (called *bending forces*). Arch
    bridges use a curved element to transfer the bridge’s weight to abutments using
    compression forces almost exclusively. Many of the oldest bridges used arches
    because it was the only way to span a gap with materials available at the time
    (stone and mortar). Even now, with the convenience of modern steel and concrete,
    arches are a popular choice for bridges. They make efficient use of materials
    but can be challenging to construct because the arch can’t provide its support
    until it is complete. Temporary supports are required during construction until
    the arch is connected at its apex from both sides.'

  zh: 另一种桥梁类型利用了存在数千年的结构特征：拱。大多数材料在其轴向受力比施加在垂直方向（称为*弯曲力*）时更强。拱桥利用弯曲元素将桥梁的重量几乎完全通过压缩力传递到桥墩上。许多最古老的桥梁使用拱，因为那是当时能够跨越间隙的唯一方式（石材和灰浆）。即使现在，随着现代钢铁和混凝土的便利，拱仍然是桥梁的流行选择。它们有效利用材料，但施工可能具有挑战性，因为拱在完成之前无法提供支撑。在拱从两侧连接到其顶点之前，施工期间需要临时支撑。
- en: When the arch is below the roadway, we call it a *deck arch bridge* (like the
    example shown). Vertical supports transfer the load of the deck onto the arch.
    If part of the arch extends above the roadway with the deck suspended below, it’s
    called a *through arch bridge*. Arches can be formed in many ways, including individual
    steel beams, steel trusses, reinforced concrete, or even stone or brick masonry.
    One result of compressing an arch is that it creates horizontal forces called
    *thrusts*. Arch bridges usually need strong abutments at either side to push against
    that can withstand the extra horizontal loads. Alternatively, a *tied arch bridge*
    uses a chord to connect both sides of the arch like a bowstring so it can resist
    the thrust forces. If each end of the arch sits atop a spindly pier, you can be
    sure that they are tied together.

  zh: 当拱位于道路下方时，我们称之为*甲板拱桥*（如所示示例）。垂直支撑将甲板的荷载传递到拱上。如果拱的一部分延伸到道路上方，而甲板悬挂在下方，则称为*通过拱桥*。拱可以采用多种形式形成，包括单独的钢梁、钢桁架、钢筋混凝土，甚至是石材或砖砌。压缩拱的一个结果是产生水平力，称为*推力*。拱桥通常需要强大的桥墩在两侧推动，以抵抗额外的水平载荷。作为替代，*系拱桥*使用弦连接拱的两侧，类似弓弦，以抵抗推力。如果拱的每端坐落在细长的桥墩上，可以确保它们被系在一起。
- en: Another way to increase the span of a beam bridge is to move the supports so
    that sections of the deck balance on their center instead of being supported at
    each end. A cantilever bridge uses beams or trusses that project horizontally
    from their supports, moving most of the weight above the supports rather than
    in the center of the span. A typical cantilever bridge has four supports, of which
    the two central piers bear the compression loads from the bridge. The outermost
    supports resist tension to provide the balancing force for each cantilevered arm.
    Cantilever bridges often use large steel trusses, but they can be constructed
    of concrete as well. Some even include a suspended section between the two cantilevered
    arms.

  zh: 增加梁桥跨度的另一种方式是移动支撑，使得甲板的各个部分在其中心平衡而不是在每端支撑。悬臂桥使用从其支撑物水平伸出的梁或桁架，将大部分重量移至支撑物上方，而不是在跨度的中心。典型的悬臂桥有四个支撑物，其中两个中央桥墩承受桥梁的压力载荷。最外侧的支撑物抵抗张力，为每个悬臂臂提供平衡力。悬臂桥通常使用大型钢桁架，但也可以用混凝土建造。有些甚至在两个悬臂臂之间包含一个悬吊段落。
- en: The longest bridges in the world take advantage of steel’s ability to withstand
    incredible tension forces. Cable-stayed bridges support the bridge deck from above
    through cables attached to tall towers. The cables (also called stays) form a
    fan pattern, giving this type of bridge its unique appearance. Depending on the
    span, cable-stayed bridges can have one central tower or a pair. Their simplicity
    allows for a wide variety of configurations, giving rise to some dramatic (and
    often asymmetric) shapes.

- en: Where a cable-stayed bridge attaches the deck directly to each tower, a suspension
    bridge instead uses two massive main cables to dangle the road deck below with
    vertical hangers. Suspension bridges are iconic structures due to their enormous
    spans and slender, graceful appearance. A tower on either side props up the main
    cables like a broomstick in a blanket fort. Most of the bridge’s weight is transferred
    into the foundation through these towers. The rest is transferred into the bridge’s
    abutments through immense anchorages keeping the cables from pulling out of the
    ground. Because they are so slender and lightweight, most suspension bridges require
    stiffening with girders or trusses along the deck to reduce movement from wind
    and traffic loads. These bridges are costly to build and maintain, so they are
    constructed only when no other structure will suffice. Many consider suspension
    bridges to be the pinnacle of civil engineering ingenuity.

  zh: 在斜拉桥中，桥面直接通过缆索与每个塔柱连接，而悬索桥则使用两根巨大的主缆索，将桥面通过垂直吊杆悬挂在下面。悬索桥因其巨大的跨度和纤细、优雅的外观而成为标志性结构。每侧的塔柱支撑着主缆索，就像一根扫帚棒支撑在一个毯子堡垒中。大部分桥梁的重量通过这些塔柱传递到基础中，剩余部分则通过巨大的锚固装置传递到桥的桥头墩，以防止缆索被拉出地面。由于悬索桥非常纤细且轻盈，因此大多数悬索桥需要通过桥面上的梁或桁架进行加固，以减少风力和交通荷载的影响。这些桥梁建造和维护成本高昂，因此只有在没有其他结构可以替代的情况下才会建造。许多人认为悬索桥是土木工程技术的巅峰之作。

    that contribute to its function. Bridges are often divided between the superstructure
    (which carries the traffic loads across each span) and the substructure (which
    transfers the weight of the superstructure into the foundation). Each of the two
    sections contains fascinating details.

  zh: 虽然每座桥梁都不同，但大多数桥梁都共享一些可以从外部观察到的共同元素。通过桥梁的横截面可以看到各个部分，它们共同作用使桥梁得以正常运作。桥梁通常分为上部结构（承载交通荷载并跨越每个跨度）和下部结构（将上部结构的重量传递到基础中）。这两部分各自包含着引人入胜的细节。
- en: The surface of a bridge upon which vehicles travel is called the deck. Most
    often, it consists of a concrete slab set atop the beams. In some cases, the deck
    is *precast*, meaning the concrete has already been formed and cured before it
    is lifted into place. Otherwise, the deck is cast in place, using formwork to
    hold its shape until the concrete hardens. If this method is used during construction,
    it must be done carefully. Concrete is heavy, after all, and as more and more
    of it is added to the beams, the structure will begin to flex. To avoid cracks,
    contractors carefully sequence their work so that most of this movement happens
    early during placement before the concrete fully hardens.

  zh: 桥梁上供车辆通行的表面称为桥面。通常，它由一块混凝土板构成，置于梁的上方。在某些情况下，桥面是*预制*的，这意味着混凝土在被提升到位之前已经成型并养护过。否则，桥面是在现场浇筑的，使用模板保持其形状，直到混凝土硬化。如果使用这种方法进行施工，必须小心操作。毕竟，混凝土非常重，当越来越多的混凝土被加到梁上时，结构会开始弯曲。为了避免裂缝，承包商会仔细安排施工顺序，使得大部分这种变形在混凝土完全硬化之前就发生。
- en: The deck includes a slope, either from the center (called a *crown*) or from
    one edge, to ensure that rainwater won’t pond on the roadway. A layer of waterproofing
    and pavement is added to the concrete deck slab to protect it from harsh weather
    and damage from traffic. This wearing course also smooths out any unevenness,
    providing a more enjoyable ride for motorists. It is meant to be replaced regularly
    while the slab beneath remains a permanent part of the bridge. A bridge deck also
    often features safety barriers along the edges to prevent errant vehicles from
    falling off, drains to direct water away from structural members, and walkways
    to accommodate pedestrian traffic.

- en: Most bridges will have some type of beams, or girders, to support the deck,
    depending on the design. For beam bridges, these are the primary load-bearing
    elements transferring all the forces to the substructure. For other types of bridges,
    the beams may only be adding stiffness to the deck or supporting its weight between
    hangers, cable stays, or the nodes of a truss that do the brunt of the lifting.
    Girders experience the most significant forces along their upper and lower extremities.
    Generally, the top of the beam undergoes compression and the bottom experiences
    tension, so most girders are shaped like a capital “I” to have more material in
    the flanges, with a narrow web in the center where forces are not so significant.
    These girders are usually made from steel plates or reinforced concrete. Another
    popular shape is the box girder, which is essentially a closed structural tube.
    Boxes are often used on bridges that curve because they can withstand twisting
    better than typical girders.

  zh: 大多数桥梁都会有某种类型的梁或梁架来支撑桥面，这取决于设计。对于梁桥来说，梁是主要的承载元素，负责将所有的力传递到桥墩下部结构。对于其他类型的桥梁，梁可能只是为桥面增加刚度，或者支撑其重量，桥面通过吊杆、拉索或桁架的节点来承受主要的承载力。梁架在其上部和下部会受到最显著的力。一般来说，梁的上部承受压缩，下部则承受拉伸，因此大多数梁的形状像大写字母“I”，使得翼缘部分有更多的材料，而中间的腹板则较窄，因为此处受力较小。这些梁架通常由钢板或钢筋混凝土制成。另一种常见的形状是箱梁，它本质上是一个封闭的结构管。箱梁常用于弯曲的桥梁，因为它们比普通的梁更能抵抗扭曲。
- en: 'Bearings transfer loads of the superstructure to the substructure; they “bear”
    the bridge’s weight. The girders can’t sit directly on the piers or abutments
    for a straightforward reason: bridges move. The superstructure deforms and vibrates
    under the moving traffic loads, expands under the glaring sun, and shrinks when
    it cools down (especially on frigid winter nights). Without isolation from the
    substructure, these movements would build up stress and potentially cause structural
    members to fail. Bearings provide this isolation while also reducing wear and
    tear on the supports by making sure forces are evenly distributed. There are many
    exciting solutions to these challenges, and if you pay attention, you’ll notice

- en: Most modern bridges use an *elastomeric* (in other words, flexible) material
    to support the weight of the deck and girders while allowing for minor vibrations,
    rotations, and translations between the piers. Sometimes this elastomeric bearing
    pad is a standalone component consisting of pure rubber or laminated layers of
    rubber and steel plates to control bulging. Another option is a pot bearing, which
    houses the elastomeric material in a steel cylinder. The pot keeps the rubber
    from squishing out at its sides, allowing the use of a softer and more pliable
    material. Pot bearings sometimes include steel plates to accommodate sliding motions
    and can be designed to restrain or release different motions, depending on the
    needs of each bridge. Many older bridges used roller bearings or rocker bearings
    to allow for both rotation and horizontal movement of the superstructure. These
    types of bearings are mostly being phased out because they are costly to maintain.

    girders, deck, trusses, cables, and hangers and transfer them to the underlying

    powerful scour forces from a river, and the type of bridge being supported. Solid
    intermediate supports are usually called *piers*. Alternatively, when a support
    consists of multiple columns with a cap, it is called a bent. At each terminus
    of the bridge span is an *abutment*. These supports are often larger than piers
    or bents because they withstand both vertical and horizontal loads from the superstructure.
    Abutments also serve as the transition between a bridge and the at-grade roadway,

    constructed using the *cut-and-cover* method, starting with a trench. Excavating
    below the surface of an urban area is a disruptive and challenging ordeal. Existing
    roadways must be rerouted. Utility lines must be protected or redirected. Nearby
    buildings may need extra support to avoid settling. Retaining walls are required
    to hold the trench open while the tunnel can be constructed (more on them in Chapter
    3). Finally, groundwater must be continuously managed. If the retaining walls
    are not watertight, temporary dewatering wells may be installed to pump it directly
    from the earth. Another option is *ground freezing*, which uses a refrigeration
    system and coolant pipes to freeze a layer of water and earth into an impermeable
    barrier. This temporary wall of ice strengthens the soil and prevents the migration
    of groundwater into the work area.

  zh: 隧道的另一个重要作用是在空间珍贵的密集城市地区。快速轨道交通系统通常使用地下空间，这样可以避免与地面道路和其他基础设施发生冲突。由于这些隧道通常离地面较近，许多快速轨道交通隧道通常采用*切槽法*进行建设，从挖掘沟槽开始。在城市地区进行地下挖掘是一项具有破坏性且充满挑战的工作。现有的道路必须重新规划。公用设施管线必须得到保护或重新引导。附近的建筑物可能需要额外支撑以防止沉降。在隧道建设过程中，需要设置挡土墙以保持沟槽的开放（更多内容请参见第三章）。最后，地下水必须持续管理。如果挡土墙不具备防水能力，可能需要安装临时排水井将水从地下抽出。另一种选择是*冻土法*，该方法使用制冷系统和冷却管道将一层水和土壤冻结成不透水的屏障。这层临时冰墙能够加固土壤，并防止地下水迁移进入施工区域。

    that, the trench is backfilled, and the infrastructure on the surface can be restored.

    *immersed tube construction*, prefabricated tunnel sections can be carefully sunk
    into dredged trenches below the water. Each unit is attached by divers, backfilled
    with soil to prevent floating, and then pumped dry. In urban areas, cut-and-cover
    tunnels are usually constructed in short sections because it isn’t feasible to
    open a long stretch of the ground in a city for months or years. Such disruption
    is avoided by the other method of tunnel construction: *boring*.'

  zh: 切槽法也常用于建造水下隧道。在*沉管法*中，预制的隧道段可以小心地沉入已挖掘的水下沟槽中。每个单元由潜水员连接，然后回填土壤以防浮起，再进行排水。在城市地区，切槽法隧道通常分段建设，因为在城市中开挖一长段地面几个月或几年是不现实的。这种干扰可以通过另一种隧道建造方法来避免：*钻孔*。
- en: 'Just like cut-and-cover, boring a tunnel follows a few main steps: excavate
    and remove the soil or rock, install supports to hold back the surrounding earth
    and water, then complete the tunnel features. The benefit of boring is that it
    can be performed without disturbing the surface, speeding up construction and
    making it possible to build in areas that would be otherwise inaccessible (such
    as along busy streets or below existing buildings). Although historical methods
    of tunnel construction used a variety of techniques, modern tunnels are bored
    in two primary ways. First, they can be manually excavated. In rock, the face
    of the tunnel is advanced by drilling blasting holes, filling the holes with explosives,
    and blasting the material apart. In soft soils, crews may use a temporary support
    called a *shield* to provide access to the tunnel face. A significant benefit
    of manually excavating a tunnel is that the design can be adjusted to accommodate
    changing geology. Additional support is installed only when needed (for example,
    when the rock is weak or fractured), saving the cost of unnecessary strengthening.'

  zh: 就像盖挖法一样，钻孔隧道也遵循几个主要步骤：挖掘并移除土壤或岩石，安装支撑物以抵御周围的土壤和水，然后完成隧道的其他特征。钻孔的好处在于它可以在不扰动地表的情况下进行，从而加快施工速度，并使得在那些原本无法到达的区域（如繁忙街道或现有建筑物下方）进行施工成为可能。尽管历史上的隧道建设采用了多种技术，现代隧道主要通过两种方式进行钻掘。首先，它们可以通过人工挖掘完成。在岩石中，隧道的开口通过钻孔、填充炸药并进行爆破来推进。在软土中，施工队可能使用一种临时支撑叫做*盾构*来为隧道面提供通道。人工挖掘隧道的一个显著优势是，可以根据不断变化的地质条件调整设计。只有在需要时（例如岩石较弱或破裂时）才安装额外支撑，从而节省不必要的加固成本。
- en: The other option is to use a tunnel boring machine (TBM). These massive pieces
    of equipment act like giant drills, using a rotating cutterhead to chew through
    the rock and soil. TBMs also include conveyors to remove the spoils as they are
    excavated and equipment to install concrete lining segments that support the tunnel
    walls and roof. (The next section includes more details on tunnel lining.) Although
    they are hugely expensive and difficult to transport, these machines can make
    tunnel construction a rapid and efficient process. They are most often used on
    long, large-diameter projects or tunnels in very challenging ground conditions.

- en: Tunnel excavation tends to be a slow process, so longer tunnels are sometimes
    constructed from both sides at the same time. This cuts down on construction time
    but creates a challenge. How can two crews blindly bore toward each other and
    meet accurately in the middle? The surveyors who guide tunnel construction crews
    or a TBM in the right direction do not have access to navigational satellites
    or surface reference markers. Instead, they often rely on the Earth’s magnetic
    field to establish a bearing. A magnetic compass isn’t accurate enough for this
    purpose because of the interference from iron and steel used in construction.
    Even a tiny error in direction can compound to significant deviations over a long
    distance. So, surveyors make use of gyroscopes that can point toward north to
    a high degree of precision. These instruments make it possible for tunnels to
    accurately break through in the center of the exit shaft and even for two tunnel
    construction crews to meet in the middle.

  zh: 隧道开挖通常是一个缓慢的过程，因此较长的隧道有时会从两端同时开挖。这能减少施工时间，但也带来了挑战。如何让两支队伍盲目地朝着对方挖掘并准确地在中间会合呢？指导隧道施工队伍或
    TBM 朝正确方向前进的测量员无法使用导航卫星或地面参考标记。相反，他们通常依赖地球的磁场来确定方向。由于建筑中使用的铁钢材料的干扰，磁罗盘的精度不足以达到这个目的。即便是微小的方向误差，经过长距离后也会累积成显著的偏差。因此，测量员使用能够指向北方并具有高精度的陀螺仪。这些仪器使得隧道能够准确地在出口竖井中心突破，甚至使两支隧道施工队伍能够在中间会合。

- en: Like atmospheric pressure created by the weight of air, pressure also exists
    in the earth’s subsurface from the mass of the soil and rock above. This pressure
    compresses the subterranean material more and more the farther down you go. Building
    a tunnel through the earth interrupts the flow of these compressive forces. Similar
    to removing a column from a building, excavating a tunnel takes away the support.
    Tunnels are often constructed below the groundwater table, making them subject
    to water pressure as well. But where loads in a building come only from above,
    earth and water pressure in a tunnel can come from all sides. Most tunnels are
    installed with a *lining* to resist the pressure from the ground, hold the passageway
    open against collapse, and minimizing the infiltration of groundwater.

  zh: 类似于空气的重量产生的气压，地下也存在来自上方土壤和岩石质量的压力。随着深度的增加，这种压力会越来越大。这种压力会压缩地下材料。当在地下开挖隧道时，就会中断这些压力的流动。类似于从建筑物中移除支柱，开挖隧道会移除支撑。隧道通常建在地下水位以下，因此也会受到水压的影响。然而，在建筑物中，荷载通常仅来自上方，而隧道中的土壤和水压则可能来自四面八方。大多数隧道都安装有*衬砌*，以抵抗来自地面的压力，保持通道在崩塌的情况下畅通，并最大限度地减少地下水的渗透。
- en: Manually bored tunnels are often lined using concrete sprayed on the walls,
    called shotcrete, to provide the initial support. This layer helps hold the soil
    and rock together while stresses redistribute after excavation. A final lining
    of steel or concrete is added later. In urban cut-and-cover tunnels, the lining
    usually consists of reinforced concrete cast in place. The falsework and reinforcing
    steel are erected first, and then concrete is pumped or poured into the forms
    to harden. Once it has cured, the formwork is removed, and the soil around the
    tunnel walls and roof can be backfilled. For machine-bored tunnels, the lining
    usually consists of concrete rings. Each ring is made from precast segments and
    delivered to the tunnel face, ready to be lifted into place. The segments include
    a gasket to seal out groundwater and use tapered geometry to lock tightly together
    when installed.

  zh: 手工钻探的隧道通常会用喷射混凝土（叫做喷射混凝土）覆盖墙面，以提供初步支撑。这层喷射混凝土帮助将土壤和岩石粘合在一起，同时在开挖后，压力会重新分布。最终，钢筋或混凝土衬砌会在后续加上。在城市的开挖和覆盖隧道中，衬砌通常是现场浇筑的钢筋混凝土。假支架和钢筋首先搭建好，然后将混凝土泵送或浇筑到模具中硬化。一旦混凝土固化，模板就会被移除，隧道墙壁和屋顶周围的土壤可以回填。对于机械钻探的隧道，衬砌通常由混凝土环组成。每个环由预制的混凝土段构成，运送到隧道前端，准备好被提升到位。这些段包括一个密封圈，用来防止地下水渗透，并采用锥形几何设计，当安装时能够紧密锁合在一起。

    shape against ground pressure. The arch redistributes the forces around the passage
    just like an arch bridge over a river. However, a tunnel may not look circular
    to a motorist since many use interior walls to separate traffic from the various
    support systems and utilities. Although they are often hidden from view, a careful
    observer can see hints of these systems when traveling through a tunnel.

- en: A critical function of a tunnel’s support systems is drainage. There must be
    a way to manage precipitation that comes in through the portals, groundwater that
    seeps through the lining, and water used to wash the tunnel walls or for fighting
    fires. Drainage usually enters a channel or pipe through slots in the roadway
    curbs. When possible, a tunnel can be sloped such that water drains from the center
    toward the portals. However, many tunnels are too deep underground to drain freely.
    In this case, they are equipped with small reservoirs at low spots called sumps.
    When the sump fills with water, a switch turns on a pump that delivers the tunnel
    drainage to a sewer or outfall. The water in a tunnel often picks up pollution
    as it travels, so it can become quite dirty. Modern tunnels often include ways
    to treat drainage before discharging it.

- en: One of the most vital safety elements of a tunnel is ventilation. Engines, tires,
    and brakes emit a range of pollutants that can be confined and concentrated inside
    a tunnel. Also, vehicles occasionally catch fire. When this happens in a tunnel,
    the resulting smoke can be particularly hazardous because there aren’t many options
    for egress. Managing the flow of air into and out of a tunnel is quite complicated.
    Too little ventilation will allow pollution to build up. However, excessive airflow
    can accelerate the growth of a fire and create turbulence that prevents smoke
    from rising. Tunnels employ many different ventilation schemes to keep the fresh
    air flowing.

- en: Many tunnels work like simple pipes with fresh air entering one portal and exhaust
    air leaving the opposite side. This scheme is known as *longitudinal ventilation*.
    It is accomplished using jet fans mounted to the ceiling that force the air inside
    the tunnel to keep moving. Another option is to blow a jet of air into the tunnel
    entrance at a shallow angle through an opening called a *Saccardo nozzle*. Longitudinal
    ventilation works best on tunnels with a single direction for traffic flow because
    the air moves along with the vehicles. During a fire, the cars beyond the accident
    can exit the tunnel along with the airflow carrying away smoke. Vehicles caught
    upstream of the fire are also upwind, so they aren’t exposed to harmful smoke.

- en: 'Above a certain length, longitudinal ventilation becomes less efficient. It
    is challenging to create enough pressure to keep the air moving effectively over
    exceptionally long distances. And, even if the airflow is sufficient, it picks
    up pollutants as it travels such that its quality at the end of the tunnel is
    much poorer than at the entrance. In these cases, it makes more sense to use *transverse
    ventilation* where the air is supplied or exhausted at discrete locations throughout
    the tunnel’s length. Transverse ventilation requires ducts to deliver fresh air
    or remove exhaust from each damper in the tunnel. Two ducts are necessary for
    a fully transverse system: one for supply air and one for exhaust. The newest
    ventilation systems use zones that can extract smoke from a fire without transporting
    it along the length of the entire tunnel. Sophisticated control systems can identify
    accidents and adjust dampers and fans to isolate each zone.'

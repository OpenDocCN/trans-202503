    around. In fact, many of the most magnificent of Earth’s features are also the
    most challenging to traverse. Rivers and mountains aren’t conducive to roadways,
    railways, or other corridors along the ground’s surface. When the topography is
    too wet, steep, treacherous, or prone to disaster, the only way forward is up
    or down. At canyons, valleys, and rivers, our roadways break free from the earth
    using bridges. And at hills, mountains, and shallow waterways, they bore right
    through to the other side. Perhaps because these structures solve such a grand
    but singular problem—creating a path to the other side—bridges and tunnels are
    among the most celebrated human achievements and full of fascinating engineering
    details. They are almost always custom-designed for a specific location, conforming
    to the local topography, geology, and hydrology (not to mention regional architectural
    preferences and styles). So, each bridge and tunnel is distinct with its own individual
    character. Because of their size and importance, these structures often reflect
    that character outward, becoming a symbol of the places they connect.

    We certainly could build exquisite electrical transmission lines or stunning sanitary
    sewers, but we rarely want to bear the cost. Bridges are different, though. It
    seems that humanity decided if we must clutter up the most scenic parts of the
    landscape with structures, we should at least give them some charm. That’s not
    to say ugly bridges don’t exist in the world, but the physical appearance of bridges
    is often a significant consideration during their design. To an enthusiast of
    constructed works, many are downright breathtaking. There are so many ways to
    span a gap, all singular in function but remarkably different in form. No matter
    how it’s accomplished, there is something magical about a structure that can support
    substantial loads with nothing underneath.

- en: One of the simplest structural crossings is the beam bridge. It consists of
    one or more beams (often called girders) resting on piers or abutments below.
    Beam bridges usually can’t span great distances because the girders required would
    be too large. At a certain distance, the beams become so heavy that they can hardly
    support their own weight, let alone the roadway and traffic on top. Beams are
    mainly used for short bridges or in applications that allow for many intermediate
    piers for support. Most bridges used in highway interchanges are of the beam type.
    Although beautiful in their own way, overpasses are usually quite utilitarian.
    (See Chapter 3 for more details on interchanges.)

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way around the challenge of the structural members’ self-weight is to use
    a truss instead of a girder. A truss is an assembly of smaller elements that creates
    a rigid and lightweight structure. This weight reduction allows trusses to span
    greater distances than solid beams. Truss bridges can take many forms. The illustration
    shows a *through truss*, with the road deck on the bottom level and structural
    members above the bridge (as opposed to a *deck truss*, which hides the structural
    members below the road).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Another type of bridge takes advantage of a structural feature that has been
    around for millennia: the arch. Most materials are stronger against forces along
    their axis than those applied at right angles (called *bending forces*). Arch
    bridges use a curved element to transfer the bridge’s weight to abutments using
    compression forces almost exclusively. Many of the oldest bridges used arches
    because it was the only way to span a gap with materials available at the time
    (stone and mortar). Even now, with the convenience of modern steel and concrete,
    arches are a popular choice for bridges. They make efficient use of materials
    but can be challenging to construct because the arch can’t provide its support
    until it is complete. Temporary supports are required during construction until
    the arch is connected at its apex from both sides.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the arch is below the roadway, we call it a *deck arch bridge* (like the
    example shown). Vertical supports transfer the load of the deck onto the arch.
    If part of the arch extends above the roadway with the deck suspended below, it’s
    called a *through arch bridge*. Arches can be formed in many ways, including individual
    steel beams, steel trusses, reinforced concrete, or even stone or brick masonry.
    One result of compressing an arch is that it creates horizontal forces called
    *thrusts*. Arch bridges usually need strong abutments at either side to push against
    that can withstand the extra horizontal loads. Alternatively, a *tied arch bridge*
    uses a chord to connect both sides of the arch like a bowstring so it can resist
    the thrust forces. If each end of the arch sits atop a spindly pier, you can be
    sure that they are tied together.

- en: Another way to increase the span of a beam bridge is to move the supports so
    that sections of the deck balance on their center instead of being supported at
    each end. A cantilever bridge uses beams or trusses that project horizontally
    from their supports, moving most of the weight above the supports rather than
    in the center of the span. A typical cantilever bridge has four supports, of which
    the two central piers bear the compression loads from the bridge. The outermost
    supports resist tension to provide the balancing force for each cantilevered arm.
    Cantilever bridges often use large steel trusses, but they can be constructed
    of concrete as well. Some even include a suspended section between the two cantilevered
    arms.

- en: The longest bridges in the world take advantage of steel’s ability to withstand
    incredible tension forces. Cable-stayed bridges support the bridge deck from above
    through cables attached to tall towers. The cables (also called stays) form a
    fan pattern, giving this type of bridge its unique appearance. Depending on the
    span, cable-stayed bridges can have one central tower or a pair. Their simplicity
    allows for a wide variety of configurations, giving rise to some dramatic (and
    often asymmetric) shapes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Where a cable-stayed bridge attaches the deck directly to each tower, a suspension
    bridge instead uses two massive main cables to dangle the road deck below with
    vertical hangers. Suspension bridges are iconic structures due to their enormous
    spans and slender, graceful appearance. A tower on either side props up the main
    cables like a broomstick in a blanket fort. Most of the bridge’s weight is transferred
    into the foundation through these towers. The rest is transferred into the bridge’s
    abutments through immense anchorages keeping the cables from pulling out of the
    ground. Because they are so slender and lightweight, most suspension bridges require
    stiffening with girders or trusses along the deck to reduce movement from wind
    and traffic loads. These bridges are costly to build and maintain, so they are
    constructed only when no other structure will suffice. Many consider suspension
    bridges to be the pinnacle of civil engineering ingenuity.

    boats and ships. Although not common, there are numerous types of moveable bridges
    around the world, all of which are unique and customized for a specific location.
    One of my favorite activities in a new city is to watch a moving bridge to try

    from the outside. A cross section through a bridge reveals the individual parts
    that contribute to its function. Bridges are often divided between the superstructure
    (which carries the traffic loads across each span) and the substructure (which
    transfers the weight of the superstructure into the foundation). Each of the two
    sections contains fascinating details.

- en: The surface of a bridge upon which vehicles travel is called the deck. Most
    often, it consists of a concrete slab set atop the beams. In some cases, the deck
    is *precast*, meaning the concrete has already been formed and cured before it
    is lifted into place. Otherwise, the deck is cast in place, using formwork to
    hold its shape until the concrete hardens. If this method is used during construction,
    it must be done carefully. Concrete is heavy, after all, and as more and more
    of it is added to the beams, the structure will begin to flex. To avoid cracks,
    contractors carefully sequence their work so that most of this movement happens
    early during placement before the concrete fully hardens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The deck includes a slope, either from the center (called a *crown*) or from
    one edge, to ensure that rainwater won’t pond on the roadway. A layer of waterproofing
    and pavement is added to the concrete deck slab to protect it from harsh weather
    and damage from traffic. This wearing course also smooths out any unevenness,
    providing a more enjoyable ride for motorists. It is meant to be replaced regularly
    while the slab beneath remains a permanent part of the bridge. A bridge deck also
    often features safety barriers along the edges to prevent errant vehicles from
    falling off, drains to direct water away from structural members, and walkways
    to accommodate pedestrian traffic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most bridges will have some type of beams, or girders, to support the deck,
    depending on the design. For beam bridges, these are the primary load-bearing
    elements transferring all the forces to the substructure. For other types of bridges,
    the beams may only be adding stiffness to the deck or supporting its weight between
    hangers, cable stays, or the nodes of a truss that do the brunt of the lifting.
    Girders experience the most significant forces along their upper and lower extremities.
    Generally, the top of the beam undergoes compression and the bottom experiences
    tension, so most girders are shaped like a capital “I” to have more material in
    the flanges, with a narrow web in the center where forces are not so significant.
    These girders are usually made from steel plates or reinforced concrete. Another
    popular shape is the box girder, which is essentially a closed structural tube.
    Boxes are often used on bridges that curve because they can withstand twisting
    better than typical girders.

- en: 'Bearings transfer loads of the superstructure to the substructure; they “bear”
    the bridge’s weight. The girders can’t sit directly on the piers or abutments
    for a straightforward reason: bridges move. The superstructure deforms and vibrates
    under the moving traffic loads, expands under the glaring sun, and shrinks when
    it cools down (especially on frigid winter nights). Without isolation from the
    substructure, these movements would build up stress and potentially cause structural
    members to fail. Bearings provide this isolation while also reducing wear and
    tear on the supports by making sure forces are evenly distributed. There are many
    exciting solutions to these challenges, and if you pay attention, you’ll notice
    a wide variety of bridge bearing styles.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most modern bridges use an *elastomeric* (in other words, flexible) material
    to support the weight of the deck and girders while allowing for minor vibrations,
    rotations, and translations between the piers. Sometimes this elastomeric bearing
    pad is a standalone component consisting of pure rubber or laminated layers of
    rubber and steel plates to control bulging. Another option is a pot bearing, which
    houses the elastomeric material in a steel cylinder. The pot keeps the rubber
    from squishing out at its sides, allowing the use of a softer and more pliable
    material. Pot bearings sometimes include steel plates to accommodate sliding motions
    and can be designed to restrain or release different motions, depending on the
    needs of each bridge. Many older bridges used roller bearings or rocker bearings
    to allow for both rotation and horizontal movement of the superstructure. These
    types of bearings are mostly being phased out because they are costly to maintain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The substructure consists of vertical elements that carry the loads from the
    girders, deck, trusses, cables, and hangers and transfer them to the underlying
    ground. A substructure can take many different forms, depending on the nature
    of the soil and rock below the bridge, whether the elements will be subject to
    powerful scour forces from a river, and the type of bridge being supported. Solid
    intermediate supports are usually called *piers*. Alternatively, when a support
    consists of multiple columns with a cap, it is called a bent. At each terminus
    of the bridge span is an *abutment*. These supports are often larger than piers
    or bents because they withstand both vertical and horizontal loads from the superstructure.
    Abutments also serve as the transition between a bridge and the at-grade roadway,
    so they sometimes act as a retaining wall for the soil below the approaching roadway.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The bridge’s foundation is the part of the substructure that transfers the weight
    of the piers, bents, or abutments into the earth. Some foundations consist of
    a simple concrete pad called a footing. However, most bridge foundations use piles,
    slender steel, or concrete members drilled or driven into the earth. Sometimes
    piles are battered (in other words, given an angle from vertical) to help resist
    horizontal forces in addition to vertical ones. Multiple piles are used at each
    support, and the group is tied together with a pile cap upon which the columns
    sit.

    the earth within which motor vehicles, trains, and even pedestrians can travel.
    However, tunnels are among the most technically challenging and expensive engineering
    projects in the world. A few types of infrastructure make use of underground tubes
    (many of which are discussed within this book), but this chapter focuses on tunnels
    used for transportation. Although costly and challenging to construct, tunnels
    enable travel across geographic features that would otherwise be difficult or
    impossible to traverse. They also open a whole new dimension of travel, maximizing
    the use of valuable land in dense urban areas. It’s a different world below the

    Tunnels are common in mountainous regions where grades are too steep or treacherous
    along the surface. Instead of winding up and over the steep topography, sometimes
    it is more practical to simply go right through it. Some mountain tunnels stretch
    only a short distance between portals (the name for tunnel entrances and exits),
    but the longest are upward of 30 miles (50 kilometers) long.

    always the simplest way to cross a river or bay, especially in areas with heavy
    maritime traffic. Where a bridge might encroach on a waterway with its supports,
    an underwater tunnel allows for unrestricted travel of boats and ships.

- en: Another critical role of tunnels comes in dense urban areas where space on the
    surface is precious. Rapid transit railways often use subterranean space, allowing
    them to avoid conflicts with surface roadways and other infrastructure. Because
    they usually aren’t far below the surface, many rapid transit tunnels are often
    constructed using the *cut-and-cover* method, starting with a trench. Excavating
    below the surface of an urban area is a disruptive and challenging ordeal. Existing
    roadways must be rerouted. Utility lines must be protected or redirected. Nearby
    buildings may need extra support to avoid settling. Retaining walls are required
    to hold the trench open while the tunnel can be constructed (more on them in Chapter
    3). Finally, groundwater must be continuously managed. If the retaining walls
    are not watertight, temporary dewatering wells may be installed to pump it directly
    from the earth. Another option is *ground freezing*, which uses a refrigeration
    system and coolant pipes to freeze a layer of water and earth into an impermeable
    barrier. This temporary wall of ice strengthens the soil and prevents the migration
    of groundwater into the work area.

    *immersed tube construction*, prefabricated tunnel sections can be carefully sunk
    into dredged trenches below the water. Each unit is attached by divers, backfilled
    with soil to prevent floating, and then pumped dry. In urban areas, cut-and-cover
    tunnels are usually constructed in short sections because it isn’t feasible to
    open a long stretch of the ground in a city for months or years. Such disruption
    is avoided by the other method of tunnel construction: *boring*.'

    and remove the soil or rock, install supports to hold back the surrounding earth
    and water, then complete the tunnel features. The benefit of boring is that it
    can be performed without disturbing the surface, speeding up construction and
    making it possible to build in areas that would be otherwise inaccessible (such
    as along busy streets or below existing buildings). Although historical methods
    of tunnel construction used a variety of techniques, modern tunnels are bored
    in two primary ways. First, they can be manually excavated. In rock, the face
    of the tunnel is advanced by drilling blasting holes, filling the holes with explosives,
    and blasting the material apart. In soft soils, crews may use a temporary support
    called a *shield* to provide access to the tunnel face. A significant benefit
    of manually excavating a tunnel is that the design can be adjusted to accommodate
    changing geology. Additional support is installed only when needed (for example,
    when the rock is weak or fractured), saving the cost of unnecessary strengthening.'

    of equipment act like giant drills, using a rotating cutterhead to chew through
    the rock and soil. TBMs also include conveyors to remove the spoils as they are
    excavated and equipment to install concrete lining segments that support the tunnel
    walls and roof. (The next section includes more details on tunnel lining.) Although
    they are hugely expensive and difficult to transport, these machines can make
    tunnel construction a rapid and efficient process. They are most often used on
    long, large-diameter projects or tunnels in very challenging ground conditions.

    constructed from both sides at the same time. This cuts down on construction time
    but creates a challenge. How can two crews blindly bore toward each other and
    meet accurately in the middle? The surveyors who guide tunnel construction crews
    or a TBM in the right direction do not have access to navigational satellites
    or surface reference markers. Instead, they often rely on the Earth’s magnetic
    field to establish a bearing. A magnetic compass isn’t accurate enough for this
    purpose because of the interference from iron and steel used in construction.
    Even a tiny error in direction can compound to significant deviations over a long
    distance. So, surveyors make use of gyroscopes that can point toward north to
    a high degree of precision. These instruments make it possible for tunnels to
    accurately break through in the center of the exit shaft and even for two tunnel
    construction crews to meet in the middle.

    in the earth’s subsurface from the mass of the soil and rock above. This pressure
    compresses the subterranean material more and more the farther down you go. Building
    a tunnel through the earth interrupts the flow of these compressive forces. Similar
    to removing a column from a building, excavating a tunnel takes away the support.
    Tunnels are often constructed below the groundwater table, making them subject
    to water pressure as well. But where loads in a building come only from above,
    earth and water pressure in a tunnel can come from all sides. Most tunnels are
    installed with a *lining* to resist the pressure from the ground, hold the passageway
    open against collapse, and minimizing the infiltration of groundwater.

- en: Manually bored tunnels are often lined using concrete sprayed on the walls,
    called shotcrete, to provide the initial support. This layer helps hold the soil
    and rock together while stresses redistribute after excavation. A final lining
    of steel or concrete is added later. In urban cut-and-cover tunnels, the lining
    usually consists of reinforced concrete cast in place. The falsework and reinforcing
    steel are erected first, and then concrete is pumped or poured into the forms
    to harden. Once it has cured, the formwork is removed, and the soil around the
    tunnel walls and roof can be backfilled. For machine-bored tunnels, the lining
    usually consists of concrete rings. Each ring is made from precast segments and
    delivered to the tunnel face, ready to be lifted into place. The segments include
    a gasket to seal out groundwater and use tapered geometry to lock tightly together

    support systems and utilities. Although they are often hidden from view, a careful
    observer can see hints of these systems when traveling through a tunnel.
  prefs: []

- en: A critical function of a tunnel’s support systems is drainage. There must be
    a way to manage precipitation that comes in through the portals, groundwater that
    seeps through the lining, and water used to wash the tunnel walls or for fighting
    fires. Drainage usually enters a channel or pipe through slots in the roadway
    curbs. When possible, a tunnel can be sloped such that water drains from the center
    toward the portals. However, many tunnels are too deep underground to drain freely.
    In this case, they are equipped with small reservoirs at low spots called sumps.
    When the sump fills with water, a switch turns on a pump that delivers the tunnel
    drainage to a sewer or outfall. The water in a tunnel often picks up pollution
    as it travels, so it can become quite dirty. Modern tunnels often include ways
    to treat drainage before discharging it.

    and brakes emit a range of pollutants that can be confined and concentrated inside
    a tunnel. Also, vehicles occasionally catch fire. When this happens in a tunnel,
    the resulting smoke can be particularly hazardous because there aren’t many options
    for egress. Managing the flow of air into and out of a tunnel is quite complicated.
    Too little ventilation will allow pollution to build up. However, excessive airflow
    can accelerate the growth of a fire and create turbulence that prevents smoke
    from rising. Tunnels employ many different ventilation schemes to keep the fresh
    air flowing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    air leaving the opposite side. This scheme is known as *longitudinal ventilation*.
    It is accomplished using jet fans mounted to the ceiling that force the air inside
    the tunnel to keep moving. Another option is to blow a jet of air into the tunnel
    entrance at a shallow angle through an opening called a *Saccardo nozzle*. Longitudinal
    ventilation works best on tunnels with a single direction for traffic flow because
    the air moves along with the vehicles. During a fire, the cars beyond the accident
    can exit the tunnel along with the airflow carrying away smoke. Vehicles caught
    upstream of the fire are also upwind, so they aren’t exposed to harmful smoke.

    is challenging to create enough pressure to keep the air moving effectively over
    exceptionally long distances. And, even if the airflow is sufficient, it picks
    up pollutants as it travels such that its quality at the end of the tunnel is
    much poorer than at the entrance. In these cases, it makes more sense to use *transverse
    ventilation* where the air is supplied or exhausted at discrete locations throughout
    the tunnel’s length. Transverse ventilation requires ducts to deliver fresh air
    or remove exhaust from each damper in the tunnel. Two ducts are necessary for
    a fully transverse system: one for supply air and one for exhaust. The newest
    ventilation systems use zones that can extract smoke from a fire without transporting
    it along the length of the entire tunnel. Sophisticated control systems can identify
    accidents and adjust dampers and fans to isolate each zone.'

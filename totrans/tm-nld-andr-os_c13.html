<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">F</span><em>ramework</em><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-1" id="c13-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> is the term that the Android team applies to a large chunk of the core platform that encompasses the internal operating system level stuff (the bits of software that underlie almost everything else on the system except the kernel), along with the APIs that applications use to access those features. Examples of framework functionality include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The package manager, responsible for installing and managing applications on the device.</li>
<li>Power management, controlling, for example, the brightness settings of the screen (the screen being the heaviest user of power on any device). </li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_118" title="118"/>Window management, displaying applications on the screen and animating them in and out as they open and close.</li>
<li>Input, receiving information from the touchscreen hardware and turning it into input events that are routed to applications.</li>
<li>Activity manager, handling the multitasking system on Android, deciding things like which applications to kill when memory is getting low on the device.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the framework engineers started arriving onto Android in late 2005, none of this existed, so the people who started on the Android team back then had to build the framework, piece by piece.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c13-0001">Dianne Hackborn and the Android Framework</h2>
<blockquote class="Epigraph" epub:type="epigraph">
<p class="Epigraph">The person whose work defines most the shape [of the Android platform] is clearly Dianne. I’m sure she would probably downplay her influence here. But she’s wrong.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="BodyFirst">By the end of 2005, some of the pieces of what would become the framework were started, but there was still a long way to go, including APIs for applications to use and all of the other capabilities that the system required. Then Dianne Hackborn joined the team.</p>
<p>Dianne (also known to the team as “hackbod”<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-2" id="c13-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup>) is, as most people on the team would agree, the person who best understands the entire breadth of the Android framework and the overall platform. For one thing, she has a comprehensive understanding of how all of the pieces in the platform fit together, along with an extensive knowledge of operating systems and APIs in general.</p>
<p>Also, she wrote most of the framework code.</p>
<p>Dianne came from computer royalty. Her father started the printer division at Hewlett-Packard and was under consideration for CEO at some <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_119" title="119"/>point. At an age when other kids were experiencing computers through playing video games, she was into system design. “I would look into the way the system works, and the ways that it worked with applications and threading.”</p>
<p>After college, she worked at Lucent Technologies, while playing with BeOS in her spare time (“writing frameworks, some applications. UI layout frameworks . . . that kind of stuff”). Eventually, she wanted that work to be more than a side interest, and moved to the Bay Area to work for Be.</p>
<p>“That was at the time of the dot-com boom. You’re working at a company that isn’t making any money, not sure how you’re going to make money, but everybody wants to work on operating systems. That’s why they’re there. It’s not about making money.”<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-3" id="c13-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Dianne started at Be in late 1999, joining a group of people there that she would work with later at PalmSource, and then again when she joined Android. She worked on the framework at Be and then again at PalmSource.</p>
<p>At Be, Dianne worked on the next version of BeOS, but that was the end of the line for that operating system. “They were trying to compete with Microsoft. You can’t compete with the entrenched platform. Unless they shoot themselves in the foot, it is impossible because their ecosystem has so much momentum that anything you do better than them, they have years to react to you for it to matter.</p>
<p>“And it’s chicken and egg. You have to get users to get app developers interested in you, and you have to get developers to get users interested in you. You can get some users, but anywhere you try to gain momentum, the dominant platform can go address that particular market and kill you. It’s just impossible.”</p>
<p>Eventually, Palm acquired Be, because Palm had plans to build a more robust OS for their devices and needed engineers with the right expertise to make it happen. It was Dianne’s introduction to mobile computing. “I had never thought about mobile at the time. But once I started looking at Palm, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_120" title="120"/>that’s when I got really interested. That seemed like the way you compete with Microsoft. It’s a new kind of device, so if you can be the platform on that device, then you have a bigger ecosystem than Windows and you have a chance. You could see the writing on the wall. The hardware was getting more powerful, and the market was already bigger than PCs.”</p>
<p>But PalmSource was struggling. The original idea with their spinout from Palm was that they would provide the OS that Palm (and other companies) would use. But by the time PalmSource came up with Palm OS 6,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-4" id="c13-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup> Palm had decided to just continue using the OS they began with when Palm and PalmSource split. Then a deal fell through when the team was nearly done with a product-quality OS on a potential Samsung device. After that, there were no other buyers in sight for the OS, so the company started shopping itself around to be acquired.</p>
<p>There’s an interesting dynamic of mobile OSes that Dianne and the team were forced to deal with at the time, which would resurface (more successfully) later on Android. “It was really hard to get phone manufacturers interested in someone else’s platform. They did their own software and they were terrified of phones becoming the same as PCs, where there’s one software vendor that owns the platform that commoditizes the hardware.”</p>
<p>That model of hardware companies creating their own OS worked when software was simpler. Handling phone calls and contact information for a flip phone was well within the capabilities of all of those companies. But when the required capabilities and feature sets kept increasing, especially after the iPhone launched, it was difficult for those companies to keep up. The companies that needed an OS in the wake of the iPhone launch were looking for something far more complex than they could create on their own, and were therefore more willing to work with Android. </p>
<p>“The software becomes more valuable than the hardware. Most of your investment is now in the software. And if that’s the case, then whoever can invest the most in the software is going to be the most compelling, and that’s probably someone dedicated to a platform that works across different hardware.”</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_121" title="121"/>Part of Palm OS 6 was a powerful UI framework. Motorola, a potential suitor of PalmSource, was interested in that framework and in Palm OS 6 in general for its own devices. But Motorola’s acquisition attempt failed, and PalmSource was acquired by ACCESS Co., Ltd. “It would have been really interesting to get acquired by Motorola. We were all hoping for that. They wanted to take what we were doing and use it.” ACCESS, on the other hand, was not on board with the current direction.</p>
<p>After the acquisition, ACCESS changed the team’s OS strategy. Dianne and her team were done. “PalmSource was over. Handset manufacturers didn’t want to touch someone else’s platform, because they didn’t want to be an enabler. I was seeing my team out the door (I was managing the framework team there). Mathias and Joe were leaving. They came to me and said ‘you should come over to Google—there’s really cool stuff going on here.’ They gave me hints: ‘It’s a platform . . . it’s open source . . . .’ Work at Google doing an open source mobile platform where you don’t have to worry about money? How can you say no to that? It’s, like, perfect.”</p>
<p>Dianne joined Google and started on the Android team in January of 2006.</p>
<p>She was introduced to Google’s take on the Android strategy early on. “When I joined, the way Larry and Sergey were talking about it, and the way Andy was presenting it, they didn’t want just a product. It was grander than that: the future survival of Google. They didn’t want a company with a closed proprietary platform to own and control the space, like Microsoft owns the PC platform. It wasn’t about needing to make money.”<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-5" id="c13-footnoteref-5">5</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c13-0002">Activities</h2>
<blockquote class="Epigraph" epub:type="epigraph">
<p class="Epigraph">It’s hard to out-code Dianne when she’s on fire. She had a vision of what she wanted, and she just sat down and typed it out.</p>
<p class="EpigraphSource">—Jeff Hamilton</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_122" title="122"/>After she joined Android, Dianne started working on many of the fundamental pieces of what’s now called the framework. One of those pieces was Activities, which she took over from some initial work by Joe Onorato.</p>
<p>Activities, which evolved from longer-term ideas that the team was thinking about earlier when they were at PalmSource, are a uniquely Android way of managing applications. On a more traditional OS, an application starts, calls its <code>main()</code> method, and then just starts doing things in a loop (drawing, polling for input, doing any necessary calculations, and so on). On Android, an application is broken down into one or more “activity” pieces, each of which has its own window. Activities (and applications) have no <code>main()</code> method, but instead are called by the OS in response to events, like activity creation/destruction and user input.</p>
<p>Another important element of Activities is that they define specific entry points that can be called from other applications, like notifications or shortcuts in the system UI that can take the user to a place inside of the application. </p>
<p>Dianne said, “Palm had a really good understanding of mobile devices. One of the things we learned there was that mobile apps are fundamentally different from desktop apps: the user can only be in one at a time, and they tend to be small and focused on a particular task. Out of this grew a need to easily have apps work together. Palm OS had this hack called ‘sublaunching’ that allowed one app to effectively call in to another app, to do something like show a UI for the user to add a contact. We viewed this as an important feature for mobile apps, but needed to formalize it into a well-defined concept so it would be more robust and work in a complex multi-process protected memory (and app-sandboxed) environment. Thus Activities, which define the ways apps can expose parts of themselves for other apps (and the system) to launch as needed.”</p>
<p>Activities were a powerful concept for Android. They were also at the heart of one of the first big disagreements on the engineering team. There was certainly more complexity associated with Activities than the more traditional approach that some people preferred. In particular, Android’s application lifecycle (handling activity creation/destruction/etc.) continues to be difficult to understand, and dealing with its complexities tends to be a hard and error-prone chore for many Android developers.</p>
<p>As Jeff Hamilton (a framework engineer that we’ll read about soon) told it, “In the early days of Android, there were two competing visions of what <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_123" title="123"/>the OS should look like. One was around the fuzzy nature of Activities, and one where there’s a <code>main()</code> that gets called. Dianne and Joe were pushing on the notion of the more modular app setup with Activities.</p>
<p>“There were a bunch of other people, like Mike Fleming,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-6" id="c13-footnoteref-6">6</a></sup> in the other camp that were pushing more for a simple model. There was a big conflict there for a while.”</p>
<p>Mike Fleming said, “I was a skeptic of the application lifecycle. I was concerned that it was too complicated.” Wei Huang<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-7" id="c13-footnoteref-7">7</a></sup> agreed: “There are certain points where I think the activity lifecycle is overly complicated. It grew a little bit out of control.”</p>
<p>But the team decided to go with the Activities approach. Jeff explained how that happened: “Dianne had a vision of what she wanted, and she just sat down and typed it out. That’s the way it worked, because she was productive and got things done.”</p>
<p>This model of decision making happened elsewhere as well, such as the initial View system that Joe implemented. The team didn’t have a lot of time for meetings and committees and debates on how things should work, so eventually someone would simply bang out a solution and things would move on from there. As Dianne said, “There were so few people that if you do it, you just do it. There was lots of discussion between people, but it was instigated by the person working on the thing.” Romain Guy (who joined later to work on the UI toolkit) added, “What was most respected [at Android] was someone just making something happen.” And often, that someone was Dianne.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c13-0003">Resources</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Dianne also worked on the resource system,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-8" id="c13-footnoteref-8">8</a></sup> which is another very Android concept. On Android, application developers are able to define different versions of text, images, sizes, and other elements of their apps, in what are called <em>resource files</em>.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_124" title="124"/>For example, you might have a button in your application that should say <em>Click</em> so that the user knows to click that button. But the word <em>Click</em> only makes sense if the user speaks English. What if they speak Russian instead? Or French? Or . . . any other non-English language? Developers use resource files to store different versions of that string for different languages. When the button is populated with a string, the resource system chooses the version that is appropriate for the language that the user has selected on their phone.</p>
<p>Similarly, developers can define what the UI looks like for screen configurations, and can use different image sizes based on different screen densities. Again, the resource system loads the appropriate variation when the application launches, depending on the user’s device.</p>
<p>Resources, and the way that they are used to solve the variable-density problem in particular, are a great example of how Android was developed as a software platform, not just as a single phone product, even in those early days before 1.0. If the team was just targeting a particular device, with a predefined screen size (as most manufacturers did at that time), none of this would have been necessary. But then applications would have been written with those initial assumptions firmly in place. When different sized screens came along later, those apps wouldn’t look right.</p>
<p>Dianne: “These devices were different from the desktop because the device has much more impact on applications than on desktop. On desktop you can have a bigger screen, but it doesn’t really matter for apps, you may just be able to resize the windows. But on these devices, if the screen gets bigger, then the apps need to draw correctly on that bigger screen.”</p>
<p>Another factor was screen density.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-9" id="c13-footnoteref-9">9</a></sup> “On the desktop, the density never changes. But we knew that the density [for mobile devices] would change. We saw this happen at Palm. We needed to design something that would let us evolve the platform over the long term, because we had seen what happened with Palm OS and its more minimalist approach. Getting it to support different screen densities was a disaster. We’ve always [for the Android platform] approached this as: ‘We’re building this for mobile devices, but we want this thing to scale and address other use cases in the long term.’”</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_125" title="125"/>In contrast, iOS and the iPhone didn’t take density into consideration in the beginning. “Apple didn’t think about this stuff. Apple is one of the few hardware companies that can also do high quality software development. Most hardware companies are focused on the hardware product, and the software is just something needed for the hardware. Apple is able to approach the software as something that they invest in long-term, separately from a particular hardware product. But you still see stuff where they are hardware-oriented, like ‘We want to change the size of the screen . . . we didn’t think about that.’”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c13-0004">WindowManager</h2>
<blockquote class="Epigraph" epub:type="epigraph">
<p class="Epigraph">Dianne says, “I’m gonna make a window manager,” and typity-type-type, there’s a window manager.</p>
<p class="EpigraphSource">—Mike Cleron</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dianne also, long before 1.0 shipped, wrote the WindowManager, which handles windows opening, closing, animating in, and animating out. It’s notable because of both the complexity of the problems it had to solve and the fact that Dianne wrote it all as just one of the many things she was doing.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-10" id="c13-footnoteref-10">10</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c13-0005">Soft Keyboard</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">After 1.0 shipped, there was still plenty of work to do. One of the things that Dianne worked on at that time, along with Amith Yamasani on the framework team, was support for the <em>soft </em><em>keyboard</em>, or the on-screen keyboard that touch-only devices needed.</p>
<p>The original G1 had a hardware keyboard. Entering text into an application required flipping that keyboard out. This mechanism worked fine (and in fact many smartphone users continued to prefer hardware keyboards for years after that, especially BlackBerry fans). But the demand for larger screens and smaller devices meant that support for an all-touch device, with an on-screen keyboard, was critical. In fact, the device that was going to launch with the upcoming Cupcake release would have no hardware keyboard.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_126" title="126"/>In typical Android development fashion, the soft keyboard wasn’t just hacked into the framework. Android was known for making trade-offs to get performance or to hit ship dates, but the team always prioritized creating general platform capabilities instead of hacks for specific product features, which was the case for their keyboard solution. The team created a system to provide extensible and flexible support for generalized input. For example, the keyboard support wasn’t just called <em>keyboard</em>, but rather Input Method Editor (IME). It wasn’t sufficient to simply provide support for typing on a regular keyboard, but rather the system needed to accept input from any kind of input mechanism, including speech.</p>
<p>At the same time, input support was built not just as an internal mechanism for the framework to use, but also as an extensible feature that developers could take advantage of. Android supplied the Input Method Framework (IMF) that would accept input from any user-supplied IME, not just the keyboard that shipped with the Android system. That is, Android didn’t just supply a soft keyboard for users; they also provided APIs for developers to create their own keyboard apps that users could use instead. The short-term need was for an input system that was good enough for most use cases. But the team recognized that there might be other experiences out there, or other capabilities, that users wanted and developers could help out with, so they built the system to allow it. Even when there were only a couple of Android devices out on the market, the team was playing the long game, anticipating a potentially large and diverse ecosystem of devices and users.</p>
<p>Dianne said, “I don’t recall it ever being much of a consideration to go down the path of hard-coding it into the platform. From a practical matter of being able to address the needs of different languages, we thought this should be a user-selectable component.”</p>
<p>IME support is a great example of what attracted many developers (and users) to Android early on. The early devices like the G1 weren’t the most beautiful smartphones available, but the power and flexibility of the open ecosystem was attractive to many users and developers. The iPhone eventually offered the ability to have keyboard apps besides the one that came bundled with iOS, but that was much later, long after Android developers could offer those apps.</p>
<p>In 2009, Shumin Zhai was working in research at IBM. He was investigating alternative input mechanisms, using an app he built called <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_127" title="127"/>ShapeWriter.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-11" id="c13-footnoteref-11">11</a></sup> Rather than typing in each letter, his app allowed a user to slide their finger around the keyboard, tracing out a shape as they navigated between the letters of each word. His keyboard interpreted these shapes as words, using probabilities and heuristics to determine the words the user was tracing out.</p>
<p>Shumin built the ShapeWriter with Per Ola Kristensson in 2004, releasing it originally on the Windows Tablet PC. They later released ShapeWriter for the iPhone in 2008, but it would only work with a note-taking app that they also supplied, because the iPhone had no equivalent of Android’s IMF at the time, so it could not take the place of the system keyboard. When Android released support for the IMF, in the Cupcake release in mid-2009, Shumin switched ShapeWriter’s focus to Android, releasing the app on Android Market later that year.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-12" id="c13-footnoteref-12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>He particularly liked developing for Android<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-13" id="c13-footnoteref-13">13</a></sup> because it gave him the ability to experiment, to swap out the system keyboard for his own so that he could provide this new capability. Shumin was a researcher, which might not seem like a huge target market to go after. But around the same time, a company released a popular app on Android called Swype, which had similar gesture-typing capabilities.</p>
<p>Shumin eventually joined the Android team and led the team that implemented Gesture Typing for Android’s standard IME. Now that capability of tracing out words is built into Android’s keyboard by default. But Android still allows developers to supply their own keyboard apps for customizations and capabilities that developers want to create.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c13-0006">Jeff Hamilton Works His Way Up the Stack</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Despite Dianne’s legendary productivity, there was still much more that needed to be done to make the entire framework come into being than she <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_128" title="128"/>could handle on her own. A few other people were also writing copious amounts of framework code. One of those people was Jeff Hamilton (known to the team as “jham”).</p>
<p>Jeff started at Google on the same day as Dianne. They had worked together on framework code at Be and PalmSource, and were about to do so again on Android.</p>
<p>Jeff’s work on platforms began when he landed at Be for an internship during college. He actually failed his interview, because of his answer about how interrupt handlers<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-14" id="c13-footnoteref-14">14</a></sup> worked on BeOS, which was different from how they worked on Linux. He went home to research the difference and sent in an explanation, along with the correct answer, and the team changed their mind. They hired him for the summer, and for the next year while he was at college . . . and eventually for a full-time job when he finished college.</p>
<p>At Be, Jeff was on the kernel team, working on drivers for hardware like the touchscreen display and USB. He also got a good introduction to getting started at a scrappy Silicon Valley company: “First day, they showed me to my cube and it had a case and keyboard. They said, ‘There’s a motherboard over there, go ask George for a CPU.’ They didn’t have any RAM, I had to buy some at Fry’s.”<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-15" id="c13-footnoteref-15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>After college, Jeff joined Be full time, and eventually joined PalmSource after that acquisition in 2001. But like other members of the team, including Joe, Dianne, and Mathias, Jeff eventually tired of PalmSource. “By August 2005, it seemed pretty clear that they had no customers.” He had moved to Austin, Texas, so he looked for jobs in that area and found an opportunity at Motorola that looked perfect. “It’d be a local job. They wanted to build a new, modern smartphone OS, ship on all the phones instead of a one-off. The group I was joining had signed a deal to acquire PalmSource;<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-16" id="c13-footnoteref-16">16</a></sup> they said I’d fit right in. It all sounded really good, so I quit PalmSource, joined Motorola in August of 2005.”</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_129" title="129"/>But before the PalmSource deal closed, ACCESS swooped in and offered more money, and PalmSource took the higher bid. With the smartphone OS possibility at Motorola shut down, Jeff wasn’t very inspired to stick around. Fortunately, his colleagues from Be/PalmSource were in the process of interviewing with and joining the Android team at Google. Jeff heard about the opportunity from his friend Joe. “I said I didn’t know anything about search or the web, and I don’t want to start a new job remotely, not knowing anybody on the team. Joe said ‘Don’t worry about the first one, and you already know over half the team. Just come interview.’” Joe repaid Jeff’s favor of getting Joe in the door at Be years earlier by getting him hired even though he was remote: “He convinced Andy to hire me when I was in Austin and working from home.”</p>
<p>When Jeff started on the team, Android wasn’t so much a <em>platform</em> as a collection of random pieces of code, prototypes, and technology demos. “Joe had a demo of the window manager drawing a square—basic shapes on the screen. There was a guy<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-17" id="c13-footnoteref-17">17</a></sup> working on telephony. Mathias was working on graphics. But nothing was functional. There wasn’t really an operating system.”</p>
<p>One of Jeff’s first tasks came from Brian Swetland, building a protocol<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-18" id="c13-footnoteref-18">18</a></sup> for debugging Android applications running on a device. Rather than implement his own system from scratch, Jeff got gdb (a standard debugging tool) up and running. This meant getting a bunch of other things working on the OS that gdb needed, like threading and support for debugging symbols.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-19" id="c13-footnoteref-19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Once debugging was working, Jeff started work on Binder.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c13-0007"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_130" title="130"/>Binder</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Binder was a concept that the engineers from PalmSource were familiar with from that previous company and OS.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-20" id="c13-footnoteref-20">20</a></sup> Binder is an IPC<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-21" id="c13-footnoteref-21">21</a></sup> mechanism. Whenever something happens on an operating system that needs to involve more than one process, IPC is a system for sending these messages between those different processes. For example, when the user types onto a keyboard on a PC, the system process sends a message with that information to the foreground application process to deal with that key event. An IPC system (Binder, in the case of Android) defines that communication mechanism.</p>
<p>On an Android device, many processes are running at all times, handling different parts of the system. There’s the system process, handling process management, application launching, window management, and other lower-level operating system features. There’s the telephony process, keeping the phone connection alive. There’s the foreground application that the user is actually interacting with. There’s the system UI, which handles the navigation buttons, the status bar, and notifications. And so on—there are many, many processes, and they all need to communicate with other processes at some point.</p>
<p>IPC mechanisms are typically simple and low-level, which was something that the former Danger engineers wanted. As Wei Huang put it, “Danger liked to do things fast. Simple and fast. But mostly simple.” But the team from Be, including Jeff, Joe, and Dianne, preferred the more full-featured (and complex) mechanism of the Binder approach that they had implemented at PalmSource. And since Binder was open sourced, it was available to use for this new platform.</p>
<p>This disagreement caused a problem between the teams. Mike Fleming was on the Danger side of the fence: “I was a Binder skeptic. I didn’t think it <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_131" title="131"/>had been very well thought through. It’s true that they had done it at Palm. It was also true that they had never shipped it in a product.</p>
<p>“I was particularly upset with the fact that you had to make a blocking call<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-22" id="c13-footnoteref-22">22</a></sup> to the Binder that would then make a blocking invocation on the other side. I felt that caused a lot of unnecessary threading, and it didn’t provide any value for my use case. Also, the original Binder Linux kernel driver was not fully robust. It took a lot of work to get it fully bullet-proof.”<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-23" id="c13-footnoteref-23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>The Binder skeptics didn’t win that battle: Jeff and team forged ahead and implemented Binder, which became a fundamental part of the Android framework architecture. In the meantime, Mike ignored Binder for his telephony work: “I opened a Unix domain socket<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-24" id="c13-footnoteref-24">24</a></sup> between the Java process and the native interface layer process.”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c13-0008">Database</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">After Jeff got the initial Binder module working, he moved on to databases. Applications generally need to store information. If that data is anything non-trivial, they need something robust and full-featured; they need a database. At PalmSource, Jeff had worked with databases, but that company had wanted to create something new. Android wasn’t trying to invent anything; they just needed a solution. “I had looked at SQLite<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-25" id="c13-footnoteref-25">25</a></sup> and thought, if we’re trying to build our own phone and get it out the door ASAP, we probably shouldn’t build our own database system from scratch. SQLite is there—it works.” So Jeff ported the library to make it work on Android, creating APIs for app developers to be able to access it, and then moved onto the next project.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c13-0009"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_132" title="132"/>Contacts and Other Apps</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Because he was already dealing with application data, Jeff got pulled into a project to define how applications would share data. The data in someone’s contacts needed to be available to other applications on the device (to be able to, say, call or message a friend). This resulted in the ContentProvider APIs, which Jeff then used as he started working on the Contacts application. “Obviously, we should have an address book and a call log, so I started building the Contacts ContentProvider to have an address book so you could dial the phone.” Once that worked, he continued moving up the software stack to work on the UI of the Contacts application itself.</p>
<p>After Contacts, Jeff moved on to various other parts of the platform and the core applications. He helped out with the SMS app at one point, which was primarily being developed by Wei Huang. He also helped out on the telephony software that Mike Fleming was writing, and then assisted with the dialer app for the phone.</p>
<p>Dialer and Contacts, at that time, were both part of the same application. Jeff wanted to make some operations easier in the Dialer, so he created a controversial UI feature he called “Strequent.” “In the dialer, there was one tab for your dialer, one tab for your call log, and one tab for your contacts. I created this other tab called Strequent. It was your starred contacts, followed by your frequently called people. Everyone thought it was really weird. I remember Steve Horowitz<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-26" id="c13-footnoteref-26">26</a></sup> didn’t like it at all, but Rich Miner liked it.” Rich convinced Steve to take it.</p>
<p>Jeff eventually worked on most of the core applications and ended up managing the apps team. He remembered a particular user issue with Calendar: “Sergey [Google’s co-founder] came by. The Calendar app was crashing. His wife was sharing her calendar to him from Outlook. It turned out that Outlook had recurring events with exceptions that we had never seen before. Our event parser was crashing.” </p>
<p>Jeff went to Sergey and explained the problem. “‘We figured out the problem: your calendar has some data in it that we’ve never seen before and didn’t expect, and it’s causing our app to crash.’ He said, ‘My data isn’t causing your app to crash! Your app is crashing on my data!’” Jeff remembered the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_133" title="133"/>situation clearly, many years later. It’s hard to forget a Google founder and executive arguing with you.</p>
<p>The process that Jeff went through, starting at the lowest level of the system to get a native debugger working, then working on core framework internals and APIs, then data functionality and APIs, and ending up writing applications using some of the lower-level stuff he’d built,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-27" id="c13-footnoteref-27">27</a></sup> is a good example of what people on the team did. Nothing, essentially, existed before Jeff got there, so he helped create the pieces one by one, building each one on top of the previous ones as more functionality came online. In a similar way, everyone on the team was building things up from the very basics and moving up to higher-level functionality as they were able to, eventually writing the applications that defined the user experience of Android.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c13-0010">Jason Parks Broke It</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Another Be/PalmSource alumnus who came to help out on Dianne’s framework team was Jason Parks, who joined the Android team at Google in the Spring of 2006.</p>
<p>Jason Parks (known to the team as “jparks”) had a catch phrase growing up: “I didn’t break it, but I know how to fix it!” This slogan and concept stuck with him, eventually resulting in error codes in OSes he worked on with the label <code>JPARKS_BROKE_IT</code>.</p>
<p>Jason started programming early, learning BASIC in sixth grade. He continued programming through childhood and in college, but didn’t graduate. “I wasn’t really good with the words; I never finished the English courses. I had twenty-two credits to finish, but I applied to a job by accident.” Jason had been playing with BeOS on his own, so when he saw a job posting for Be, he applied.</p>
<p>“But I applied for the wrong job; I applied for a manager/architect position. In their system, you could only apply for one position at a time. I thought, ‘There goes that, I’ll have to let it go until they reset it.’ I got an email back for a phone interview for a job I was definitely not qualified for.” He ended up <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_134" title="134"/>getting an interview and a job offer, but for a different position. He asked why they called him back when he’d clearly applied for the wrong job; he was told that his application caught their attention because he was so unqualified for the role.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnote-28" id="c13-footnoteref-28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>Jason worked with the other future Android people at Be, like Dianne, Jeff, and Joe, moved with them to Palm, and eventually left PalmSource to join the Android team.</p>
<p>Like Jeff and Joe, Jason also worked on many different areas of the platform. His first week, he worked on software to deal with time zones. Then he got telephony data working during his second week. He then moved on to various bits of the framework and apps over time.</p>
<p>Jason also played an important role in the overall organization—getting people to do stuff. One of the ways this happened was as a moderator between different groups. When people had disagreements (such as the various Danger-vs.-PalmSource-factions conflicts), Jason would try to mitigate those problems. “When the telephony guy was upset around APIs, he’d come to me and ask me to go talk to them [the framework team]. Same with Swetland. Horowitz would send me to talk to Swetland to calm him down. Between Mike [Cleron] and me and Dianne, we had a good working relationship. I’d explain to others the way things should be done.</p>
<p>“There were a lot of hotheads, a lot of conflict. Not only did you have the PalmSource/Danger thing, you had Googlers coming in saying ‘This is the way you must do it.’ But I think that conflict helped us.”</p>
<p>Jason would also be tasked by Steve Horowitz to make sure that certain things happened. “Some people on the team called me the bulldog, because I was Steve’s attack dog. When he needed something done, he would send me in.”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c13-0011">Frameworking</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The list of projects happening on the framework team goes on and on, because it really is the heart and soul of the Android platform. So much of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_135" title="135"/>the rest of the system is reliant upon the fundamentals that were created on this team by Dianne, Jeff, Jason, and others. And it was all built from scratch, starting when these people began joining the team in late 2005. Meanwhile, the other pieces and apps of the platform were being built on top of the framework, like building the plane while it’s flying with a cabin full of passengers, all hoping it reaches the destination before it reaches the ground.</p>

Life in the Bay Area was more affordable back then (though still not cheap), so it was more possible to not care too much about the money. But still (at least in the ideal situation), engineers tend to be driven more by interest in what they work on than in the compensation for that work. There are (at least in the current and recent environment) plenty of tech jobs; why not find ones that interest you for the thing you’ll do for most of your waking hours?</p></aside>

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnoteref-5" id="c13-footnote-5">5.</a></sup>  I talk about this earlier, in the chapters on Google’s acquisition of Android, and later, when I discuss the factors of Android’s success. There were a few reasons behind the acquisition of Android and the things that Google was hoping to achieve. But it could be summed up by saying that they wanted an even playing field. That is, they wanted potential users of Google services to be able to access those services. Dominant players could have made that very difficult. So, for example, if Microsoft had done in the mobile arena what it did in the PC space, then they might have made it difficult for users to have had open access to Google services on those devices.</p></aside>

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnoteref-14" id="c13-footnote-14">14.</a></sup>  Interrupt handlers are used to transition from one part of the system to another; they are signals in the system that pass control elsewhere.

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnoteref-18" id="c13-footnote-18">18.</a></sup>  Protocol is a very geeky way of saying <em>language</em>. A protocol is essentially a standard way for systems to talk to each other, so that each side knows how to send information that the other will be able to understand. In this case, Jeff was building a debugging protocol that would allow someone using a desktop computer to debug applications running on an Android device; the protocol established standard mechanisms for communicating information between the systems.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnoteref-19" id="c13-footnote-19">19.</a></sup>  <em>Debugging symbols</em> are the collection of information about the code that is necessary to know when debugging an app. They are like the dictionary for the language of your binary application code, that can translate between the 0s and 1s of machine code and the readable names of functions for the humans that need to understand them. For example, if your code is crashing in a particular function, it’s useful to know the symbolic name of that function—for example, <span class="LiteralFootnote"><code>myBuggyFunction()</code></span>—rather than just the address of the function on the system (which is the only information that exists otherwise). Symbols are the extra pieces of data that the system doesn’t require, but which humans need for debugging purposes.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnoteref-20" id="c13-footnote-20">20.</a></sup>  In fact, the original concept of Binder dated back much earlier, to Be. George Hoffman, who led the graphics and framework team at Be, needed a mechanism to allow the JavaScript UI layer of Be’s ill-fated Internet Appliance to talk to lower-level system services. Binder was the result. It continued to evolve when many of those Be engineers worked on Palm OS at PalmSource, and evolved further when they got to Android. George did not end up working on Android, but worked with many future Android engineers at Be, and then PalmSource, designing with them many concepts that would eventually end up in Android, such as Activities and Intents.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnoteref-21" id="c13-footnote-21">21.</a></sup>  IPC stands for Inter-Process Communication, which is a standard element of any operating system that allows different processes to send messages to each other.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c13-footnoteref-22" id="c13-footnote-22">22.</a></sup>  A blocking call is a call to some function that must complete before the caller can continue. Blocking calls imply that the function being called must be quick and must complete successfully, so as to not cause the caller to be stuck waiting. Binder eventually (prior to 1.0) supported non-blocking calls as well.</p></aside>

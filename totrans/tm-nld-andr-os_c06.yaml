    kind of programming work. This is why engineers that are experts in 3D graphics
    have ended up working on Japanese text implementation. Their skills and experience
    get them the interview, but the actual job they end up doing is based on the things
    that need to be done.^([1](#c06-footnote-1)) It’s also why Google interviews test
    general knowledge of computer science fundamentals (algorithms and coding). These
    interviews skip what other companies view as a required step: grilling candidates
    about their domain expertise and the shiny items on their resume.^([2](#c06-footnote-2))'

    is based on similar systems, so engineers can fluidly move from one group to another.
    It’s all just software, and any specific product knowledge is something that smart
    engineers can pick up on the job. So Google hires clever engineers without looking
    for particular domain skills, assuming that they can learn what they need to do
    their job when they get to Google.

    is good at, say, creating algorithms for data analysis on servers may not have
    any idea about how to build an operating system. Or how to write a display driver.
    Or how to optimize graphics operations, or UI code, or networking. These topics
    aren’t necessarily covered in the computer science fundamentals that most undergraduates
    take, and they are also not things that arise in typical jobs that engineers have
    prior to arriving at the Google interview. Fadden said, “One of my interviewers
    told me that Google likely wouldn’t hire me because I was ‘too low level.’ We
    had a lot of trouble hiring device UI people because it’s very different from
    web UI.”

    jobs and hobby projects that people took on because of their passion in these
    particular areas. The engineers that write operating systems are engineers *that
    want to write operating systems*. There are courses taught on the subject, but
    they are not taken by everyone and are necessarily cursory; only those who really
    love OS development will end up learning what they need to do in jobs and projects
    that they take on outside of classrooms.

    of generalists. For the project to have a hope of succeeding in a world with such
    strong competition as the mobile field had at that time, Android needed to deliver
    a finished product as soon as possible. They needed to build the platform quickly,
    which meant they needed to hire domain experts who could dive right in and get
    to work. But specialists who excel in writing an operating system don’t necessarily
    sail through Google’s generalist interviews.

    the company preferred candidates from top engineering and name-brand schools.
    Specialists coming in with great experience, but a non-traditional education didn’t
    fit the mold and had a hard time making it through the process. This created problems
    with many early-Android team members, who didn’t have the academic credentials
    that the Google recruiters expected. Many of them didn’t have a college degree
    at all, much less one from a top-tier engineering school. Fadden said, “One 10+
    year industry veteran had his hiring stalled because his undergraduate GPA wasn’t
    high enough. For a company that favors Stanford PhDs, it was quite a shift to
    buy a startup where only one of the engineers graduated from college.”

    on other teams. So they encouraged the recruiter to accept those people anyway,
    and it worked. In the first year, that committee hired about 200 people for Google,
    many of them for Android. People with the skills that the Android team needed
    were routed through that more specialized hiring committee.

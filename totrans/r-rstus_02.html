<p class="cos">R has a well-earned reputation for being hard to learn, especially for those who come to it without prior programming experience. This chapter is designed to help anyone who has never used R before. You’ll set up an R programming environment with RStudio and learn how to use functions, objects, packages, and projects to work with data. You’ll also be introduced to the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_1">tidyverse</span> package, which contains the core data analysis and manipulation functions used in this book.</p>
<p class="tx">This chapter won’t provide a complete introduction to R programming; rather, it will focus on the knowledge you need to follow along with the rest of the book. If you have prior experience with R, feel free to skip ahead to <span class="xref"><a href="chapter2.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 2</a></span>.</p>

<p class="tni">You’ll need two pieces of software to use R effectively. The first is R itself, which provides the underlying computational tools that make the language work. The second is an <i class="calibre4">integrated development environment (IDE)</i> like RStudio. This coding platform simplifies working with R. The best way to understand the relationship between R and RStudio is with this analogy from Chester Ismay and Albert Kim’s book <i class="calibre4">Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse</i>: R is the engine that powers your data, and RStudio is like the dashboard that provides a user-friendly interface.</p>

<h4 class="h2" id="sec2"><span id="h2-1"/><span class="sans_futura_std_heavy_oblique_bi_">Installing R and RStudio</span></h4>
<p class="tni">To download R, go to <i class="calibre4"><a href="https://cloud.r-project.org" class="calibre3">https://cloud.r-project.org</a></i> and choose the link for your operating system. Once you’ve installed it, open the file. This should open an interface, like the one shown in <a href="chapter1.xhtml#fig1-1" class="calibre3">Figure 1-1</a>, that lets you work with R on your operating system’s command line. For example, enter <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w7bold_b_">2 + 2</span>, and you should see <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">4</span>.</p>
<figure class="img"><img alt="" class="img1" height="784" id="fig1-1" src="../images/fig1-1.jpg" width="1391"/>
<figcaption><p class="cap"><span class="sans_futura_std_book_oblique_i_">Figure 1-1: The R console</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="tx">A few brave souls work with R using only this command line, but most opt to use RStudio, which provides a way to see your files, the output of your code, and more. You can download RStudio at <i class="calibre4"><a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/" class="calibre3">https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/</a></i>. Install RStudio as you would any other app and open it.</p>

<h4 class="h2" id="sec3"><span id="h2-2"/><span class="sans_futura_std_heavy_oblique_bi_">Exploring the RStudio Interface</span></h4>
<p class="tni">The first time you open RStudio, you should see the three panes shown in <a href="chapter1.xhtml#fig1-2" class="calibre3">Figure 1-2</a>.<span aria-label=" Page 5. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_5" role="doc-pagebreak"/></p>

<figcaption><p class="cap"><span class="sans_futura_std_book_oblique_i_">Figure 1-2: The RStudio editor</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="tx">The left pane should look familiar. It’s similar to the screen you saw when working in R on the command line. This is known as the <i class="calibre4">console</i>. You’ll use it to enter code and see the results. This pane has several tabs, such as Terminal and Background Jobs, for more advanced uses. For now, you’ll stick to the default tab.</p>
<p class="tx">At the bottom right, the <i class="calibre4">files pane</i> shows all of the files on your computer. You can click any file to open it within RStudio. Finally, at the top right is the <i class="calibre4">environment pane</i>, which shows the objects that are available to you when working in RStudio. Objects are discussed in <span class="xref">“Saving Data as Objects” on <a href="#pg_11" class="calibre3">page 11</a>.</span></p>
<p class="tx">There is one more pane that you’ll typically use when working in RStudio, but to see it, first you need to create an R script file.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby="sec4" epub:type="division">
<h3 class="h1" id="sec4"><span id="h1-5"/><span class="sans_dogma_ot_bold_b_1">R Script Files</span></h3>
<p class="tni">If you write all of your code in the console, you won’t have any record of it. Say you sit down today and import your data, analyze it, and then make some graphs. If you run these operations in the console, you’ll have to re-create that code from scratch tomorrow. But if you write your code in files instead, you can run it multiple times.</p>
<p class="tx"><i class="calibre4">R script files</i>, which use the <i class="calibre4">.R</i> extension, save your code so you can run it later. To create an R script file, go to <b class="calibre9">File</b><span class="menuarrow"></span><b class="calibre9">New File</b><span class="menuarrow"></span><b class="calibre9">R Script</b>, and the <i class="calibre4">script file pane</i> should appear in the top left of RStudio, as shown in <a href="chapter1.xhtml#fig1-3" class="calibre3">Figure 1-3</a>. Save this file in your <i class="calibre4">Documents</i> folder as <i class="calibre4">sample-code.R</i>.<span aria-label=" Page 6. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_6" role="doc-pagebreak"/></p>

<figcaption><p class="cap"><span class="sans_futura_std_book_oblique_i_">Figure 1-3: The script file pane (top left)</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="tx">Now you can enter R code into the new pane to add it to your script file. For example, try entering <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w7bold_b_">2 + 2</span> in the script file pane to perform a simple addition operation.</p>
<p class="tx">To run a script file, click <b class="calibre9">Run</b> or use the keyboard shortcut <small class="calibre6">COMMAND-ENTER</small> on macOS or <small class="calibre6">CTRL-ENTER</small> on Windows. The result (<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">4</span>, in this case) should show up in the console pane.</p>
<p class="tx">You now have a working programming environment. Next you’ll use it to write some simple R code.</p>

<h3 class="h1" id="sec5"><span id="h1-6"/><span class="sans_dogma_ot_bold_b_1">Basic R Syntax</span></h3>
<p class="tni">If you’re trying to learn R, you probably want to perform more complex operations than <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">2 + 2</span>, but understanding the fundamentals will prepare you to do more serious data analysis tasks later in this chapter. Let’s cover some of these basics.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec6" epub:type="division">
<h4 class="h2" id="sec6"><span id="h2-3"/><span class="sans_futura_std_heavy_oblique_bi_">Arithmetic Operators</span></h4>
<p class="tni">Besides <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">+</span>, R supports the common arithmetic operators <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">-</span> for subtraction, <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">*</span> for multiplication, and <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">/</span> for division. Try entering the following in the console:</p>
<pre id="pre-1" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">&gt; <b class="calibre9">2 - 1</b>
1
&gt; <b class="calibre9">3 * 3</b>
9
&gt; <b class="calibre9">16 / 4</b>
4
</code></pre>
<p class="tx"><span aria-label=" Page 7. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_7" role="doc-pagebreak"/>As you can see, R returns the result of each calculation you enter. You don’t have to add the spaces around operators as shown here, but doing so makes your code much more readable.</p>
<p class="tx">You can also use parentheses to perform multiple operations at once and see their result. The parentheses specify the order in which R will evaluate the expression. Try running the following:</p>
<pre id="pre-2" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">&gt; <b class="calibre9">2 * (2 + 1)</b>
6
</code></pre>
<p class="tni">This code first evaluates the expression within the parentheses, <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">2 + 1</span>, before multiplying the result by <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">2</span> in order to get <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">6</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">R also has more advanced arithmetic operators, such as <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">**</span> to calculate exponents:</p>
<pre id="pre-3" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">&gt; <b class="calibre9">2 ** 3</b>
8
</code></pre>
<p class="tni">This is equivalent to 2<sup class="calibre12">3</sup>, which returns <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">8</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">To get the remainder of a division operation, you can use the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">%%</span> operator:</p>
<pre id="pre-4" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">&gt; <b class="calibre9">10 %% 3</b>
1
</code></pre>
<p class="tni">Dividing <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">10</span> by <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">3</span> produces a remainder of <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">1</span>, the value R returns.</p>
<p class="tx">You won’t need to use these advanced arithmetic operators for the activities in this book, but they’re good to know nonetheless.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec7" epub:type="division">
<h4 class="h2" id="sec7"><span id="h2-4"/><span class="sans_futura_std_heavy_oblique_bi_">Comparison Operators</span></h4>
<p class="tni">R also uses <i class="calibre4">comparison operators</i>, which let you test how one value compares to another. R will return either <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">TRUE</span> or <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">FALSE</span>. For example, enter <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w7bold_b_">2 &gt; 1</span> in the console:</p>
<pre id="pre-5" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">&gt; <b class="calibre9">2 &gt; 1</b>
TRUE
</code></pre>
<p class="tni">R should return <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">TRUE</span>, because <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">2</span> is greater than <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">1</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">Other common comparison operators include less than (<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">&lt;</span>), greater than or equal to (<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">&gt;=</span>), less than or equal to (<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">&lt;=</span>), equal to (<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">==</span>), and not equal to (<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">!=</span>). Here are some examples:</p>
<pre id="pre-6" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">&gt; <b class="calibre9">498 == 498</b>
TRUE
&gt; <b class="calibre9">2 != 2</b>
FALSE
</code></pre>
<p class="tx"><span aria-label=" Page 8. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_8" role="doc-pagebreak"/>When you enter <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">498 == 498</span> in the console, R should return <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">TRUE</span> because the two values are equal. If you run <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">2 != 2</span> in the console, R should return <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">FALSE</span> because <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">2</span> does not <i class="calibre4">not</i> equal <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">2</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">You’ll rarely use comparison operators to directly test how one value compares to another; instead, you’ll use them to perform tasks like keeping only data where a value is greater than a certain threshold. You’ll see comparison operators used in this way in <span class="xref">“tidyverse Functions” on <a href="#pg_15" class="calibre3">page 15</a></span>.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec8" epub:type="division">
<h4 class="h2" id="sec8"><span id="h2-5"/><span class="sans_futura_std_heavy_oblique_bi_">Functions</span></h4>
<p class="tni">You can perform even more useful operations by making use of R’s many <i class="calibre4">functions</i>, predefined sections of code that let you efficiently do specific things. Functions have a name and a set of parentheses containing <i class="calibre4">arguments</i>, which are values that affect the function’s behavior.</p>
<p class="tx">Consider the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">print()</span> function, which displays information:</p>
<pre id="pre-7" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">&gt; <b class="calibre9">print(x = 1.1)</b>
1.1
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">The name of the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">print()</span> function is <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">print</span>. Within the function’s parentheses, you specify the argument name—<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">x</span>, in this case—followed by the equal sign (<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">=</span>) and a value for the function to display. This code will print the number <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">1.1</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">To separate multiple arguments, you use commas. For example, you can use the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">print()</span> function’s <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">digits</span> argument to indicate how many digits of a number to display:</p>
<pre id="pre-8" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">&gt; <b class="calibre9">print(x = 1.1, digits = 1)</b>
1
</code></pre>
<p class="tni">This code will display only one digit (in other words, a whole number).</p>
<p class="tx">Using these two arguments allows you to do something specific (display results) while also giving you the flexibility to change the function’s behavior.</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="note"><span class="sans_dogma_ot_bold_b_2">NOTE</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="note-txt"><i class="calibre4">For a list of all functions built into R, see</i> <span class="copyright_accent"><a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/00Index.xhtml" class="calibre3">https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/00Index.xhtml</a></span><i class="calibre4">.</i></p>
<p class="tx">A common R pattern is using a function within a function. For example, if you wanted to calculate the <i class="calibre4">mean</i>, or average, of the values 10, 20, and 30, you could use the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">mean()</span> function to operate on the result of the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">c()</span> function like so:</p>
<pre id="pre-9" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">&gt; <b class="calibre9">mean(x = c(10, 20, 30))</b>
20
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">c()</span> function combines multiple values into one, which is necessary because the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">mean()</span> function accepts only one argument. This is why the <span aria-label=" Page 9. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_9" role="doc-pagebreak"/>code has two matching sets of open and close parentheses: one for <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">mean()</span> and a nested one for <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">c()</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">The value after the equal sign in this example, <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">c(10, 20, 30)</span>, tells R to use the values 10, 20, and 30 to calculate the mean. Running this code in the console returns the value <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">20</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">The functions <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">median()</span> and <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">mode()</span> work with <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">c()</span> in the same way. To learn how to use a function and what arguments it accepts, enter <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w7bold_b_">?</span> followed by the function’s name in the console to see the function’s help file.</p>
<p class="tx">Next, let’s look at how to import data for your R programs to work with.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="sec9" epub:type="division">
<h3 class="h1" id="sec9"><span id="h1-7"/><span class="sans_dogma_ot_bold_b_1">Working with Data</span></h3>
<p class="tni">R lets you do all of the same data manipulation tasks you might perform in a tool like Excel, such as calculating averages or totals. Conceptually, however, working with data in R is very different from working with Excel, where your data and analysis code live in the same place: a spreadsheet. While the data you work with in R might look similar to the data you work with in Excel, it typically comes from some external file, so you have to run code to import it.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec10" epub:type="division">
<h4 class="h2" id="sec10"><span id="h2-6"/><span class="sans_futura_std_heavy_oblique_bi_">Importing Data</span></h4>
<p class="tni">You’ll import data from a <i class="calibre4">comma-separated values (CSV)</i> file, a text file that holds a series of related values separated by commas. You can open CSV files using most spreadsheet applications, which use columns rather than commas as separators. For example, <a href="chapter1.xhtml#fig1-4" class="calibre3">Figure 1-4</a> shows the <i class="calibre4">population-by-state.csv</i> file in Excel.</p>
<figure class="img"><img alt="" class="img1" height="745" id="fig1-4" src="../images/fig1-4.jpg" width="1391"/>

</figure>
<p class="tx"><span aria-label=" Page 10.

Save it to a location on your computer, such as your <i class="calibre4">Documents</i> folder.</p>
<p class="tx">Next, to import the file into R, add a line like the following to the <i class="calibre4">sample-code.R</i> file you created earlier in this chapter, replacing my filepath with the path to the file’s location on your system:</p>
<pre id="pre-10" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">read.csv(file = "<var class="calibre14">/Users/davidkeyes/Documents</var>/population-by-state.csv")
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">file</span> argument in the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">read.csv()</span> function specifies the path to the file to open.</p>
<p class="tx">The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">read.csv()</span> function can accept additional optional arguments, separated by commas. For example, the following line uses the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">skip</span> argument in addition to <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">file</span> to import the same file but skip the first row:</p>
<pre id="pre-11" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">read.csv(file = "<var class="calibre14">/Users/davidkeyes/Documents</var>/population-by-state.csv", skip = 1)
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">To learn about additional arguments for this function, enter <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w7bold_b_">?read.csv()</span> in the console to see its help file.</p>
<p class="tx">At this point, you can run the code to import your data (without the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">skip</span> argument). Highlight the line you want to run in the script file pane in RStudio and click <b class="calibre9">Run</b>. You should see the following output in the console pane:</p>

<p class="tx">This is R’s way of confirming that it imported the CSV file and understands the data within it.

<p class="tx">You might think you’re ready to work with your data now, but all you’ve really done at this point is display the result of running the code that imports the data. To actually use the data, you need to save it to an object.</p>

<p class="tni">To save your data for reuse, you need to create an object. For the purposes of this discussion, an <i class="calibre4">object</i> is a data structure that is stored for later use. To create an object, update your data-importing syntax so it looks like this:</p>
<pre id="pre-13" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">population_data &lt;- read.csv(file = "<var class="calibre14">/Users/davidkeyes/Documents</var>/population-by-state.csv")

<p class="tx">This message confirms that your data import worked and that the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">population_data</span> object is ready for future use. Now, instead of having to rerun the code to import the data, you can simply enter <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">population_data</span> in an R script file or in the console to output the data.</p>
<p class="tx">Data imported to an object in this way is known as a <i class="calibre4">data frame</i>. You can see that the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">population_data</span> data frame has 52 observations and 9 variables. <i class="calibre4">Variables</i> are the data frame’s columns, each of which represents some value (for example, the population of each state). As you’ll see throughout the book, you can add new variables or modify existing ones using R code. The 52 observations come from the 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.</p>

<p class="tni">The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">read.csv()</span> function you’ve been using, as well as the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">mean()</span> and <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">c()</span> functions you saw earlier, comes from <i class="calibre4">base R</i>, the set of built-in R functions. To use base R functions, you simply enter their names. However, one of the benefits of R being an open source language is that anyone can create their own code and share it with others. R users around the world make R <i class="calibre4">packages</i>, which provide custom functions to accomplish specific goals.</p>
<p class="tx">The best analogy for understanding packages also comes from the book <i class="calibre4">Statistical Inference via Data Science</i>. The functionality in base R is like the features built into a smartphone. A smartphone can do a lot on its own, but you usually want to install additional apps for specific tasks. Packages are like apps, giving you functionality beyond what’s built into base R. In <span class="xref"><a href="chapter12.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 12</a></span>, you’ll create your own R package.</p>
<p class="tx">You can install packages using the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">install.packages()</span> function. You’ll be working with the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">tidyverse</span> package, which provides a range of functions for data import, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and more. To install it, enter <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w7bold_b_">install.packages("tidyverse")</span>. Typically, you’ll enter package installation code in the console rather than in a script file because you need to install a package only once on your computer to access its code in the future.</p>
<p class="tx">To confirm that the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">tidyverse</span> package has been installed correctly, click the <b class="calibre9">Packages</b> tab on the bottom-right pane in RStudio. Search for <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">tidyverse</span>, and you should see it pop up.</p>
<p class="tx">Now that you’ve installed the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">tidyverse</span>, you’ll put it to use. Although you need to <i class="calibre4">install</i> packages only once per computer, you need to <i class="calibre4">load</i> them each time you restart RStudio. Return to the <i class="calibre4">sample-code.R</i> file and reimport your data using a function from the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">tidyverse</span> package (your filepath will look slightly different):</p>
<pre id="pre-14" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">library(tidyverse)

population_data_2 &lt;- read_csv(file = "/<var class="calibre14">Users/davidkeyes/Documents/</var>population-by-state.csv")
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">At the top of the script, the line <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">library(tidyverse)</span> loads the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">tidyverse</span> package. Then, the package’s <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">read_csv()</span> function imports the data. Note the underscore (<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">_</span>) in place of the period (<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">.</span>) in the function’s name; this differs from the base R function you used earlier. Using <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">read_csv()</span> to import CSV files achieves the same goal of creating an object, however—in this case, one called <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">population_data_2</span>. Enter <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w7bold_b_">population_data_2</span> in the console, and you should see this output:</p>

<p class="tx">This data looks slightly different from the data you generated using the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">read.csv()</span> function. For example, R shows only the first 10 rows. This variation occurs because <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">read_csv()</span> imports the data not as a data frame but as a data type called a <i class="calibre4">tibble</i>. Both data frames and tibbles are used to describe <i class="calibre4">rectangular</i> data like what you would see in a spreadsheet. There are some minor differences between data frames and tibbles, the most important of which is that tibbles print only the first 10 rows by default, while data frames print all rows. For the purposes of this book, the two terms are used interchangeably.</p>

<h3 class="h1" id="sec13"><span id="h1-8"/><span class="sans_dogma_ot_bold_b_1">RStudio Projects</span></h3>
<p class="tni">So far, you’ve imported a CSV file from your <i class="calibre4">Documents</i> folder. But because others won’t have this exact location on their computer, your code won’t work if they try to run it. One solution to this problem is an RStudio project.</p>
<p class="tx">By working in a project, you can use <i class="calibre4">relative paths</i> to your files instead of having to write the entire filepath when calling a function to import data. Then, if you place the CSV file in your project, anyone can open it by using the file’s name, as in <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">read_csv(file = "population-by-state.csv")</span>. This makes the path easier to write and enables others to use your code.</p>
<p class="tx">To create a new RStudio project, go to <b class="calibre9">File</b><span class="menuarrow"></span><b class="calibre9">New Project</b>. Select either <b class="calibre9">New Directory</b> or <b class="calibre9">Existing Directory</b> and choose where to put your project. If you choose New Directory, you’ll need to specify that you want to create a new project. Next, choose a name for the new directory and where it should live. (Leave the checkboxes that ask about creating a Git repository and using <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">renv</span> unchecked; they’re for more advanced purposes.)</p>
<p class="tx">Once you’ve created this project, you should see two major differences in RStudio’s appearance. First, the files pane no longer shows every file on your computer. Instead, it shows only files in the <i class="calibre4">example-project</i> directory. Right now, that’s just the <i class="calibre4">example-project.Rproj</i> file, which indicates that the folder contains a project. Second, at the top right of RStudio, you can see the name <i class="calibre4">example-project</i>. This label previously read <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Project: (None)</span>. If you want to make sure you’re working in a project, check for its name here. <a href="chapter1.xhtml#fig1-6" class="calibre3">Figure 1-6</a> shows these changes.<span aria-label=" Page 14. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_14" role="doc-pagebreak"/></p>
<figure class="img"><img alt="" class="img1" height="780" id="fig1-6" src="../images/fig1-6.jpg" width="1391"/>
<figcaption><p class="cap"><span class="sans_futura_std_book_oblique_i_">Figure 1-6: RStudio with an active project</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="tx">Now that you’ve created a project, copy the <i class="calibre4">population-by-state.csv</i> file into the <i class="calibre4">example-project</i> directory. Once you’ve done so, you should see it in the RStudio files pane.</p>
<p class="tx">With this CSV file in your project, you can now import it more easily. As before, start by loading the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">tidyverse</span> package. Then, remove the reference to the <i class="calibre4">Documents</i> folder and import your data by simply using the name of the file:</p>
<pre id="pre-16" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">library(tidyverse)

population_data_2 &lt;- read_csv(file = "population-by-state.csv")
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">The reason you can import the <i class="calibre4">population-by-state.csv</i> file this way is that the RStudio project sets the working directory to be the root of your project. With the working directory set like this, all references to files are relative to the <i class="calibre4">.Rproj</i> file at the root of the project. Now anyone can run this code because it imports the data from a location that is guaranteed to exist on their computer.</p>

<h3 class="h1" id="sec14"><span id="h1-9"/><span class="sans_dogma_ot_bold_b_1">Data Analysis with the tidyverse</span></h3>
<p class="tni">Now that you’ve imported the population data, you’re ready to do a bit of analysis on it. Although I’ve been referring to the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">tidyverse</span> as a single package, it’s actually a collection of packages. We’ll explore several of its functions throughout this book, but this section introduces you to its basic workflow.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec15" epub:type="division">
<h4 class="h2" id="sec15"><span id="h2-9"/><span aria-label=" Page 15. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_15" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="sans_futura_std_heavy_oblique_bi_">tidyverse Functions</span></h4>
<p class="tni">Because you’ve loaded the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">tidyverse</span> package, you can now access its functions. For example, the package’s <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">summarize()</span> function takes a data frame or tibble and calculates some piece of information for one or more of the variables in that dataset. The following code uses <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">summarize()</span> to calculate the mean population of all states:</p>
<pre id="pre-17" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">summarize(.data = population_data_2, mean_population = mean(Pop))
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">First, the code passes <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">population_data_2</span> to the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">summarize()</span> function’s <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">.data</span> argument to tell R to use that data frame to perform the calculation. Next, it creates a new variable called <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">mean_population</span> and assigns it to the output of the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">mean()</span> function introduced earlier. The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">mean()</span> function runs on <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Pop</span>, one of the variables in the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">population_data_2</span> data frame.</p>
<p class="tx">You might be wondering why you don’t need to use the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">c()</span> function within <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">mean()</span>, as shown earlier in this chapter. The reason is that you’re passing the function only one argument here: <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Pop</span>, which contains the set of population data for which you’re calculating the mean. In this case, there’s no need to use <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">c()</span> to combine multiple values into one.</p>
<p class="tx">Running this code should return a tibble with a single variable (<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">mean_population</span>), as shown here:</p>
<pre id="pre-18" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">#&gt; # A tibble: 1 × 1
#&gt;   mean_population
#&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;
#&gt; 1         6433422
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">The variable is of type double (<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">dbl</span>), which is used to hold general numeric data. Other common data types are integer (for whole numbers, such as <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">4</span>, <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">82</span>, and <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">915</span>), character (for text values), and logical (for the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">TRUE</span>/<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">FALSE</span> values returned from comparison operations). The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">mean_population</span> variable has a value of <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">6433422</span>, the mean population of all states.</p>
<p class="tx">Notice also that the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">summarize()</span> function creates a totally new tibble from the original <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">population_data_2</span> data frame. This is why the variables from <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">population_data_2</span> are no longer present in the output.</p>
<p class="tx">This is a basic example of data analysis, but you can do a lot more with the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">tidyverse</span>.</p>

<h4 class="h2" id="sec16"><span id="h2-10"/><span class="sans_futura_std_heavy_oblique_bi_">The tidyverse Pipe</span></h4>
<p class="tni">One advantage of working with the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">tidyverse</span> is that it uses the <i class="calibre4">pipe</i> for multistep operations. The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">tidyverse</span> pipe, which is written as <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">%&gt;%</span>, allows you to break steps into multiple lines. For example, you could rewrite your code using the pipe like so:</p>
<pre id="pre-19" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">population_data_2 %&gt;%
  summarize(mean_population = mean(Pop))
</code></pre>
<p class="tx"><span aria-label=" Page 16. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_16" role="doc-pagebreak"/>This code says, “Start with the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">population_data_2</span> data frame, then run the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">summarize()</span> function on it, creating a variable called <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">mean_population</span> by calculating the mean of the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Pop</span> variable.”</p>
<p class="tx">Notice that the line following the pipe is indented. To make the code easier to read, RStudio automatically adds two spaces to the start of lines that follow pipes.</p>
<p class="tx">The pipe becomes even more useful when you use multiple steps in your data analysis. Say, for example, you want to calculate the mean population of the five largest states. The following code adds a line that uses the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">filter()</span> function, also from the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">tidyverse</span> package, to include only states where the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">rank</span> variable is less than or equal to (<span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">&lt;=</span>) <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">5</span>. Then, it uses <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">summarize()</span> to calculate the mean of those states:</p>
<pre id="pre-20" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">population_data_2 %&gt;%
  filter(rank &lt;= 5) %&gt;%
  summarize(mean_population = mean(Pop))
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">Running this code returns the mean population of the five largest states:</p>
<pre id="pre-21" class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">#&gt; # A tibble: 1 × 1
#&gt;   mean_population
#&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;
#&gt; 1        24678497
</code></pre>
<p class="tx">Using the pipe to combine functions lets you refine your data in multiple ways while keeping it readable and easy to understand. Indentation can also make your code more readable. You’ve seen only a few functions for analysis at this point, but the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">tidyverse</span> has many more functions that enable you to do nearly anything you could hope to do with your data. Because of how useful the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">tidyverse</span> is, it will appear in every single piece of R code you write in this book.</p>

<p class="tni">Now that you’ve learned the basics of how R works, you’re probably ready to dive in and write some code. When you do, though, you’re going to encounter errors. Being able to get help when you run into issues is a key part of learning to use R successfully. There are two main strategies you can use to get unstuck.</p>
<p class="tx">The first is to read the documentation for the functions you use. Remember, to access the documentation for any function, simply enter <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w7bold_b_">?</span> and then the name of the function in the console. In the bottom-right pane in <a href="chapter1.xhtml#fig1-7" class="calibre3">Figure 1-7</a>, for example, you can see the result of running <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">?read.csv</span>.</p>

In addition, they often contain longer articles, known as <i class="calibre4">vignettes</i>, that provide an overview of how a given package works. Reading these can help you understand how to combine individual functions in the context of a larger project. Every package discussed in this book has a good documentation website.</p>

<p class="tni">In this chapter, you learned the basics of R programming. You saw how to download and set up R and RStudio, what the various RStudio panes are for, and how R script files work. You also learned how to import CSV files and explore them in R, how to save data as objects, and how to install packages to access additional functions. Then, to make the files used in your code more accessible, you created an RStudio project. Finally, you experimented with <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">tidyverse</span> functions and the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">tidyverse</span> pipe, and you learned how to get help when those functions don’t work as expected.</p>

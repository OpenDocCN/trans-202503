    information beyond a shouting distance requires plenty of innovation. Many of
    humankind’s most significant developments have been ways of sending and receiving
    messages across expanses. From smoke signals and carrier pigeons to GPS and the
    internet, telecommunications have profoundly shaped the ways we live, work, and
    play.

    and, most important, the infrastructure that makes it all possible—or at least
    it does at the time of writing. No other part of society seems to be changing
    more rapidly than our communications technologies. In 10 years, this chapter may
    seem outdated. In 20 years, the technology described here may be unrecognizable.
    It is already easy to take such systems for granted in the Information Age, but
    captivating details still exist in the engineering behind how we transfer and
    share knowledge, entertainment, and so much more.

    metal wires or glass fibers, and these lines can run in essentially two places
    to avoid conflicts with other human activities: through the air or below the ground
    (underwater is a third option in some situations). This section covers the former,

    utilities. Chapter 1 provides a look at utility poles for electricity distribution,
    but that’s not their only use. Joint poles are those shared among multiple utilities.
    Not every joint pole supports every kind of utility, but no matter which lines
    run along the pole, all their locations are carefully prescribed. Primary electrical
    distribution lines run along the tops of the poles, farthest from the ground since
    they have the greatest potential for danger. The secondary electrical lines that
    service customers run directly below them. Between the electrical and communications
    lines is a safety space reserved for utility workers to make connections and perform
    maintenance without being exposed to the danger of high-voltage lines. The communication
    space is the lowest along the poles, because these lines don’t pose a shock hazard
    and require more frequent maintenance.

    along poles, only three make up the preponderance of what you can observe on a

    is easy if you know what to look for.'

    and most communication lines aren’t meant to support their own weight as they
    span from pole to pole. Instead, a steel messenger wire provides this needed support.
    The communication cables are lashed to the messenger wire, or in the case of figure-8
    cables, the messenger wire is incorporated into the protective outer jacket.

    (*POTS*) are quickly being phased out, they still can be seen on poles around
    the world. Since 1876, we’ve been transmitting voice signals along dedicated circuits
    of copper wire, and it’s still the simplest way for a home or business to connect
    to the telephone network in many places. Each landline consists of a twisted pair
    of thin copper wires. Since every household and business can have its own direct
    lines to the *local telephone exchange*, the cables can grow quite large, sometimes
    containing hundreds or thousands of pairs. The lines join together into larger
    and larger cables at splices, easily visible by the boxy black splice enclosures
    seen near poles.

    electromagnetic interference and “cross-talk” between circuits. However, twisting
    each pair of wires in a phone line creatively solves this problem because the
    undesired interference affects each wire of the twisted pair equally. The desired
    communications signal is sent in the voltage difference between the two wires
    of the twisted pair, so any unwanted voltage common to both wires is subtracted
    out.

- en: Another ubiquitous telecommunication medium is the cable TV network (often abbreviated
    as *CATV*). Despite the name, most CATV networks support telephone and high-speed
    internet service in addition to television programming. Like POTS, the CATV network
    begins at a central location, which is called the *head-end*. From there, the
    signals are distributed mostly using coaxial cable, named because the inner conductor
    and surrounding metal shield are concentric around a common axis. These cables
    can carry high-frequency radio signals with very low losses or issues with interference
    because of the shielding effect of the outer conductor. They start as large trunks
    that feed multiple distribution lines. Amplifiers (also called *line extenders*
    and recognizable by their heat-dissipating fins) are spaced along trunks to boost
    the signal. A catv power supply provides the necessary power for all the amplifiers
    within a large radius. Taps in the distribution lines allow the connection of
    drops, which provide service to each individual customer. CATV trunks and distribution
    lines are easily recognizable by their expansion loops. These loops are present
    because coaxial cables are rigid, and they expand and contract with changes in
    temperature at a different rate than the messenger wire. Without room for thermal
    movement, they can suffer undue stresses and deterioration and even pull themselves
    out of connections.

- en: Both cable and telephone providers now often use fiber-optic cables in combination
    with copper wires or coaxial cables to distribute higher quality and more reliable
    signals. These cables utilize bundles of glass or plastic fibers to transmit signals
    as pulses of light. Fiber-optic signals can travel huge distances with very little
    loss because they are immune to electromagnetic interference. The outside of the
    cable sometimes includes an orange or yellow marker or overwrap, making it easy
    to distinguish from telephone or CATV.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fiber-optic networks are usually designed to allow for future expansion by including
    more fibers than needed. However, a major challenge with these cables is that
    they are difficult to splice. Rather than a simple physical connection required
    for an electrical splice, fiber-optic cables need much more care to avoid scattering
    or reflection of the light signal. The individual fibers must be stripped, cleaned,
    cleaved, aligned, and precisely joined, often using heat to fuse them together.
    Instead of performing this careful operation on a ladder or in a bucket truck,
    many utilities prefer to add new connections or repair their fiber-optic cables
    in specialized *splicing trucks*. That means the cables need enough slack to be
    lowered to the ground, and these slack loops are usually stored along the main
    cable. Fiber-optic cables cannot have sharp bends or twists, which could break
    the fibers, so storage brackets (often simply called *snowshoes* for their distinctive
    appearance) allow changes in direction and storage of slack without causing damage
    to the cable.

    has some serious advantages. The lines don’t require a supporting strand to bear
    their weight across poles. They are also less obtrusive and avoid adding visual
    clutter to the landscape. Finally, they are protected from a whole host of threats
    including birds, squirrels, wind, ice, sunlight, and errant vehicles crashing
    into poles. That means underground communication lines are usually more reliable,
    even though they require higher upfront costs for installation.

    in one of two ways: *trenching* or *directional boring*. Trenching is accomplished
    using an excavator to dig a linear hole (that is, a trench) in the ground. The
    duct is placed within the hole, which is then backfilled with soil. Warning tape
    is installed while backfilling to mark the presence of the cable to anyone who
    may be excavating around the line in the future. Some of these tapes even include
    wires or steel ribbons so that they can be detected from the ground surface, making
    it easier to locate the line in the future. The major disadvantage of trenching
    is the disruption caused to anything on the surface. The area must be closed off
    during construction, and sidewalks, roadways, and lawns have to be repaired after
    backfilling the trench. These repairs never seem to be as durable or attractive
    as the original.'

    inside a borehole without a trench. This method is especially advantageous for
    getting lines across rivers, congested urban areas, and critical roadways where
    it wouldn’t be feasible to use a trench. A directional drill rig on the surface
    first bores a pilot hole between the entrance pit and the exit. Workers use sensing
    equipment on the drill string and at the surface to monitor the drill’s path belowground.
    To steer the drill, the leading edge of the string is asymmetric. It can be clocked
    to any position, and the string will naturally wander in the preferred direction
    during drilling. Once the pilot hole is complete, the drill string is retracted
    with a reamer to enlarge the bore while pulling the duct from a spool, creating
    a continuous path for cables to run.

    if you want to know exactly what’s inside. The first clue is the labels. Sometimes
    you can find a company name or contact information on the cabinet giving a hint
    as to what kind of equipment it contains. Usually, cabinets serve as simple connection
    points, conveniently accessible locations for splicing a high-capacity trunk or
    feeder cable to smaller distribution lines that spread out toward customers. In
    such a case, the cabinet houses jumper equipment allowing technicians to make
    connections for CATV, telephone, or fiber-optic lines.

    In these cases, a voltage warning likely will be somewhere on the outside, and
    the housing will have louvers, since these devices often need ventilation to dissipate
    heat. Active equipment could include power supplies for the CATV network or *optical
    nodes* that convert fiber-optic signals into radio frequencies that can be distributed
    using coaxial cables.

    allows a telephone line to transmit information at much higher speed and fidelity
    than it could if it were connected directly to the nearest central office. These

    customers and combine them into a fiber-optic signal directly to the central office,
    allowing telephone companies to service a larger number of customers and provide
    higher quality voice and high-speed data services.

    the housing to be removed so that technicians can make connections or troubleshoot
    problems. For CATV, they may include a tap to provide multiple service drops.
    For telephone, they usually conceal only cable splices and not much else.

    *T1* and *DSL* are two common types of high-speed digital signals that can be
    transmitted along standard copper telephone lines. However, because of their high
    frequency compared with voice signals, these high-speed digital signals cannot
    travel far without becoming too attenuated or distorted. In rural areas with longer
    distances between telephone offices, these lines need repeaters to maintain the
    signal fidelity. The repeaters are normally housed in waterproof enclosures shaped
    like paint cans or crock pots. They’ll show up at regular intervals along the
    line, usually every mile or two.

    radio and television stations, require a line of sight; the path between the transmitter
    and receiver must be relatively unobstructed. Radio signals generally can’t reach
    beyond the horizon, which is why many *antennas* are mounted at the tops of gigantic
    towers (sometimes also called *masts*). The higher they are, the farther their
    signals can extend. Antenna towers are some of the tallest human-made structures
    in the world, with many topping out above 600 meters (about 2,000 feet). They
    are so tall that they often pose a danger to aircraft and often must be painted
    with alternating bands of orange and white color and feature warning lights at

    the wind entirely on their own. They are usually made from steel or concrete with
    a broad base to provide stiffness against the forces of Mother Nature. Self-supporting
    towers don’t take up much space, so they are ideal in urban areas where land comes
    at a premium. However, they are more expensive to construct than their counterpart
    because of the extra material required for stability against lateral wind loads.'

    steel cables (the guy wires). Guyed towers can be thin because they don’t have
    to provide stiffness against the force of the wind. The guys provide this lateral
    support so that the tower has to support only its own weight. In fact, some guyed
    towers come to a narrow point at the ground so that any minor swaying will cause
    only a pivot instead of bending or flexing of the tower. The guy wires are usually

    from a radio transmitter. The transmitter is usually located away from the tower
    inside an environmentally controlled transmitter building. For AM radio stations,
    the tower itself is the antenna and there may be a tuning hut at the tower base
    that houses equipment needed to efficiently transfer power from the transmitter
    to the tower. For FM and TV stations, the feed line (also called a transmission
    line) carries the signal from the transmitter up to the antenna, which is attached
    to the tower structure. In colder areas, the horizontal run of feed line from
    the transmitter building to the tower is protected from falling ice by an ice
    bridge. The *antenna* is the device that radiates the signal as electromagnetic
    waves. Since towers are fairly expensive and obtrusive, they are often shared
    among many stations or other users (called *colocation*). Tower owners lease space
    inside the transmitter building and on the tower structure to radio and television
    stations, police and fire departments, government agencies, and various private
    companies for their own wireless communication systems.

    elements that require a ground plane (sometimes the ground itself and sometimes
    consisting of radial, horizontal conductors). Dipole antennas are another kind
    of omnidirectional antenna that consist of two identical radiating elements, one

    use a series of dipoles, each of a slightly different length to send or receive
    a wide range of radio frequencies.  Simple antenna elements, such as dipoles,

    Luckily, there is another way to get an antenna high in the sky. Satellites are
    devices placed into orbit around the Earth using rockets. They are the pinnacle
    of wireless communications, at least in terms of range. Many satellites can transmit
    and receive radio signals from one-third of the globe simultaneously, considerably
    farther than even the tallest towers. These days we use satellites for a wide
    variety of communications, including radio, television, internet, telephone, navigation,
    weather, environmental monitoring, and so much more. Satellites used for communications
    are essentially relays, receiving signals from one location on the ground and
    amplifying and redirecting them back to somewhere else on Earth. This relay creates
    a communications channel that does not require a direct connection through wires

    The higher the orbit, the longer it takes to go around. Satellites in low-Earth
    orbit circle the globe many times per day, so they are overhead a specific location
    for only short periods of time. A group of satellites in overlapping orbits, called
    a constellation, is required to maintain continuous service. Each satellite is
    strategically placed so that any location on the ground has at least one satellite
    within line of sight at all times. Low-Earth orbiting satellites require less
    power to transmit and receive, and communications experience less delay, since
    they are closer to the Earth. They also do not require a large antenna to receive
    their signals. In fact, you probably carry an antenna in your pocket that regularly

    satellites do have to account for Doppler shift. Because the satellites move so

    in a fixed position in the sky as the Earth rotates. Although it takes considerable
    effort to launch into an orbit so high above the Earth, geostationary satellites
    have some significant advantages. Because they don’t move relative to the ground,
    antennas can be mounted in a fixed position, simplifying their design. Geostationary

    parcels of real estate. The geostationary ring is so congested that it has a waiting

    signals and focus them into the feedhorn. This metal cone transitions the waves
    into the low-noise block, the heart of the satellite antenna that includes electronic
    circuitry to perform two primary functions. First, it amplifies the weak radio

    a few hours right after nightfall or right before dawn. During those times, the

    manageable groups of customers. This strategy allows billions of individual wireless
    transmissions per day on only a few hundred channels, since nonadjacent cells

    need deterrents to prevent damage by wildlife. If you look closely, you’ll see
    a wide variety of creative approaches to this challenge. The most common are predatory
    decoys (usually owls) that scare birds away or plastic bird spikes that make climbing
    or roosting on antennas difficult. Another item you may notice on a tower is a
    gps antenna. This antenna is usually shaped like an egg and collects an accurate
    clock signal from overhead satellites required for synchronization of the signal
    processing equipment.

    urban areas, and you’ll notice antennas on just about any tall structure, including
    buildings, water towers, utility poles, and even billboards. In fact, a highly
    developed economy exists around leasing space for cell site installations, complete
    with agents, investment firms, and all the other players in the traditional real
    estate market. Often, carriers will share a tower or a building to save cost and
    reduce the visual impact on the landscape of this conspicuous type of infrastructure.
    You’ll often see two or more antenna levels on the same tower. Another way to
    curb a cell tower’s obviousness is to disguise it as something more natural like
    a tree or cactus. Some of these so-called stealth cell sites are more stealthy
    than others.

- en: These days, you’re almost always within view of a set of the rectangular sector
    antennas used to send and receive the signals used by mobile devices. These antennas
    are highly directional to maintain clear boundaries between cells, usually targeting
    a 120-degree swath of territory. The triangular platforms atop some towers allow
    for antennas to service three cells from one station, and each antenna is carefully
    aimed to avoid interference with neighboring cells. You may notice some antennas
    are tilted downward to reduce the spread of signal beyond the cell boundaries.
    The radiation pattern of each antenna sector is roughly circular. When you account
    for the necessary overlap to allow for the digital handoff if a device moves from
    one cell to another, you get a roughly hexagonal grid.

- en: The connection of each base station to the core network is called the *backhaul*.
    In most cases, a cellular base station’s backhaul is accomplished using a fiber-optic
    cable to the nearest switching center. In instances where fiber installation isn’t
    feasible, carriers can use a wireless backhaul. The circular protrusions you occasionally
    see from cell towers shaped like bass drums are actually high-capacity microwave
    antennas. Below the protective covering is a parabolic dish similar to those used
    for sending and receiving signals from satellites. These antennas are directional.
    If you could look down the center of one, you’d see its pair mounted on a tower
    in the distance facing directly back at you.

- en: Cellular infrastructure is probably the most rapidly evolving of all the topics
    covered in this book. What started as a means to provide mobile telephone service
    is now the primary access to the internet for many. Voice conversations have become
    a secondary feature of a mobile phone to the point that many prefer the term “device”
    over “phone.” As more and more gadgets gain internet connectivity (often described
    as the *Internet of Things*), demand for high-speed wireless service is only expected
    to increase. Wireless carriers will have to continue to innovate, and that means
    the cellular infrastructure of today may not look much like that of tomorrow.

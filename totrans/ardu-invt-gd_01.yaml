    a little sneaky at times. If you look up *electricity* in the dictionary, you’ll
    probably find the definition sheds little light on what it is, how it works, or,
    most importantly, how you can use it. Let’s start with the basics.

- en: To understand electricity, you first need to understand the structure of an
    atom. Atoms are the building blocks of everything around you. An atom is made
    up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The electrons have a negative charge,
    and the protons have a positive charge. A typical atom has the same number of
    electrons as protons and therefore is neutral in charge. Electricity is a form
    of energy that involves the movement or storage of charges; it is the phenomenon
    that occurs when we push or force charges to move in a prescribed manner or a
    defined path. If you’ve ever seen a lightning storm, you’ve seen evidence of the
    transfer of charges between the clouds and the ground. These charges are transferred
    through the air molecules of our atmosphere, lighting up the sky as they move.
    The movement and transfer of charges is called *current*. Current is measured
    in units called amperes (A) or milliamperes (mA).

    see electricity directly. Even the bright light we see in lightning is merely
    the air molecules changing form as charges move through them.

- en: Charges move when there is an electrical force that acts on them and a path
    for the charges to move along. That electrical force is created by an *electrical
    potential difference*, or what we commonly call *voltage*. Voltage is what ultimately
    causes charges to move, and it’s measured in volts (V). For a reference, typical
    batteries range in voltage from about 1.5 V to 12 V. A 12 V battery will cause
    charges to move faster than a 1.5 V battery.

    *(DC)* and *alternating current (AC)*. AC is the kind of electricity in the power
    lines outside your house and in your wall outlets. AC electricity is great for
    power generation (for example, power plants), transmitting power over long distances
    (like from the power plant to your home), and driving large devices (like motors
    and heaters). We don’t use AC electricity for most of our household electronics,
    however. Most small appliances and household electronics that plug into the wall
    outlet require DC electricity and use a *transformer* to convert from AC to DC.
    Further details on AC and DC are beyond the scope of this book, but the projects
    you build here will focus on DC electricity.'

    from a point of higher potential to a point of lower potential. The path by which
    charges move from the positive (+) side of a battery (high potential) to the negative
    (–) side of the battery (low potential) is called a *circuit*. A circuit consists
    of a closed path from the positive terminal to the negative terminal through a
    device such as a light-emitting diode (LED), resistor, light, or motor. [Figure
    1](ch00.xhtml#ch00fig01) shows a simple circuit containing an LED, a battery,
    and a resistor. Notice that the shape of the circuit loosely resembles a loop
    or a circle, hence the name *circuit*.

- en: In order for charges to move, the path must be made out of a material that is
    *conductive*. Conductivity is not an absolute measure but more of a continuum.
    While some materials are generally considered conductors and nonconductors, most
    materials occupy a range of values for conductivity. In other words, some materials
    allow charges to move more freely than others. Think of driving a car on different
    surfaces. On the smoothly paved interstate, you can go much faster than if you
    were off-roading or driving down dirt roads. Different roads allow for different
    speeds the same way that different materials allow for more or less conductivity.
    We use the term *resistance* to describe how much a material slows down the movement
    of charges.

    like water moving through pipes. Imagine water flowing through a garden hose.
    When you turn on the valve, water starts to flow through the hose to the other
    end, as shown in [Figure 2](ch00.xhtml#ch00fig02).

    If we turn the water valve up or down, we can change the water pressure in the
    hose. The water pressure in the hose is similar to the voltage in a circuit. If
    you increase the water pressure, the flow also increases. This is the same with
    circuits: if you increase the voltage, the current also increases. The final part
    of the analogy is in the hose itself. If we put a kink in the hose or restrict
    its diameter, we create resistance. The increase in resistance slows down the
    flow (lowers the current).'

- en: This model works pretty well to describe the flow of electricity, but you don’t
    want to set up this whole system of hoses, valves, and pipes to just let water
    run out onto the ground (unless your goal is to water the lawn). You want to do
    something with it; you want it to do *work*. In terms of circuits, we use devices
    that change electricity into other forms of useful energy, such as illuminating
    a light, rotating a motor, or sounding a buzzer. A device that converts electrical
    energy to other forms of energy is called a *load*. Thomas Edison discovered that
    he could convert electrical energy into light energy with the light bulb; you
    will do that and a whole lot more throughout this book.

    to *plated-through holes* on the edge of the board, spaced exactly 0.100 inch
    apart so that the holes on the board line up with the holes on a solderless breadboard.
    Each hole is metal plated so that you can solder wires directly to it. Or, if
    you want to use it with a breadboard, you can also solder on male headers as shown
    in [Figure 11](ch00.xhtml#ch00fig11). (Don’t worry if you’ve never soldered before;

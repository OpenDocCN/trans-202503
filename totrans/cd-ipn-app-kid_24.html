<p class="noindent"><span id="page_314"></span>
 Apple’s Swift is a powerful, beginner-friendly programming language that anyone can use to make cool apps for the iPhone or iPad. In <em>Coding iPhone Apps for Kids</em>
 , you’ll learn how to use Swift to write programs, even if you’ve never programmed before.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll work in the Xcode playground, an interactive environment where you can play with your code and see the results of your work immediately! You’ll learn the fundamentals of programming too, like how to store data in arrays, use conditional statements to make decisions, and create functions to organize your code—all with the help of clear and patient explanations.</p>
<p class="indent">Once you master the basics, you’ll build a birthday tracker app so that you won’t forget anyone’s birthday and a platform game called Schoolhouse Skateboarder with animation, jumps, and more!</p>
<p class="indent">As you begin your programming adventure, you’ll learn how to:</p>
<p class="bull">
<span class="blue-b">•</span>
 Build programs to save you time, like one that invites all of your friends to a party with just the click of a button!</p>
<p class="bull">
<span class="blue-b">•</span>
 Program a number-guessing game with loops to make the computer keep guessing until it gets the right answer</p>
<p class="bull">

 Make a real, playable game with graphics and sound effects using SpriteKit</p>
<p class="bull">
<span class="blue-b">•</span>

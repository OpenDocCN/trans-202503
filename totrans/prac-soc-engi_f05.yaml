    love you all!

- en: Throughout my career, I have been able to see further by standing on the shoulders
    of giants. This is a reference to an Isaac Newton quote that Mr. Jack Daniel frequently
    quoted, and it is the truth. Jack is but one “giant” whose shoulders I have stood
    upon to see and learn more in my efforts to grow.

- en: I cannot stress how much I have learned from others in the infosec, social engineering,
    and OSINT communities—starting with my first mentors in infosec, Jim Roller and
    Luke Winkleman. They took a bubblehead fresh out of the Navy, probably still smelling
    like amine, and included me in meetings when otherwise I would be doing busywork.
    I would also like to thank my previous manager and mentor, Jerry Bell, for encouraging
    me to submit the proposal for this book and helping to rein in my wild ideas.

- en: To the social engineering and OSINT folks, I apologize in advance if I leave
    anyone out. Social engineering is on the forefront of infosec because of the work
    that Chris Hadnagy has done (and continues to do). I am eternally thankful for
    the opportunity to compete in the SECTF, but even before that, for Chris’s book
    being in the school library when I was racking my brain for topics to research
    for my PhD dissertation (which I haven’t finished . . . yet). Michael Bazzell
    is the “OG of OSINT.” OSINT wouldn’t be where it is without his work.

- en: Conferences like Security BSides, DerbyCon, and especially Layer 8 helped me
    meet other likeminded people that I was able to collaborate with and learn from.
    I cherish my conversations with people like Jeff Man, Alethe Denis, Ginsberg5150,
    Marcelle Lee, the late Jon Case, Judy Towers, Chris Kirsch, Chris Silvers, Micah
    Hoffman, Jenny Radcliffe, and Chris Kubecka. Again, I apologize if I left anyone
    off, but this list could probably end up longer than the book itself.

- en: Beyond competing in the SECTF, I am grateful to TraceLabs not only for doing
    the legwork so I could collaborate with the authorities for the OSINT Search Parties,
    but also for holding the conferences for hosting them (pre-COVID) and for partnering
    with The OSINTion to help competitors, the authorities, and most importantly,
    the missing. Thank you to Adrian, James, Robert, Belouve, Tom, and Levi. Thank
    you also to BSides Atlanta and NOLACon for hosting OSINT CTFs.

- en: Finally, I must thank Bill, Frances, Rachel, and Sharon at No Starch Press for
    having the patience to wait for me to finish this book. I hope that they, and
    you, are happy with the final result, and I apologize for any gray hairs that
    I may have caused.

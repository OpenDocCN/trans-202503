			</header>
			<p class="BodyFirst"><span class="DropCap">Y</span>our journey as a software engineer spans your entire career. There are many stops along the way: student, engineer, tech lead, maybe even manager. Most new engineers start with a technical foundation but little real-world experience. The chapters ahead will guide you toward the first milestone of your career, which you’ll reach when you can safely deliver code changes and work seamlessly with your team.</p>
			<p>Reaching the first milestone is difficult—the information you need is scattered across the internet or, worse, tucked away in someone’s head. This book consolidates key information that you need to be successful. But what does a successful software engineer look like, and how do you get there?</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c01-0001"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_2" title="2"/>Your Destination</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Everyone begins as an entry-level engineer. To advance, you’ll need to be competent in several core areas.</p>
			<ol class="none">
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Technical knowledge</span>  You know your computer science fundamentals. You know how to use integrated development environments (IDEs), build systems, debuggers, and test frameworks. You are familiar with continuous integration, metrics and monitoring, configuration, and packaging systems. You proactively create and improve test code. You consider operations when making architectural decisions.</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Execution</span>  You create value by solving problems with code, and you understand the connection between your work and the business.

You actively participate in project and quarterly planning. You help new team members onboard. You give meaningful feedback to your manager.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c01-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_3" title="3"/>A Map for Your Journey</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">To get to your destination, you need a map. The rest of this chapter will help you navigate both this book and the beginning of your career. We start at Peak Newb, where all newbies begin. From there, we travel down Ramp-Up River, where you start coding and learning local conventions and processes. Next is Cape Contributor, where you ship some meaningful features. Shipping features means you will have to sail the storms of Operations Ocean. Finally, we will land in the safe haven of Competence Cove.</p>
			<p>We’ve annotated many paragraphs with chapter references. You can read this book linearly, or you can jump to the chapters you care most about. Many chapter references appear more than once in the outline; this is intentional. Chapters are grouped by subject, but the subjects we cover will span your career. You will discover new insights every time you revisit the material.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c01-0001">Peak Newb</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">You begin your journey as a newbie. Get familiar with the company, the team, and how things get done. Attend onboarding meetings. Set up your development environment and system access, and figure out regular team processes and meetings. Read documentation and have discussions with teammates. Contribute by filling in documentation gaps you find in the onboarding process.</p>
			<p>Your company might have a new hire orientation to help you get up and running. These programs teach you how the company works, provide a tour of the organization, and introduce company leadership. New hire programs also introduce you to new hires from other departments—your future colleagues. If your company doesn’t have a new hire program, ask your manager to explain the “org chart” (who is in charge of what and who reports to whom), the different departments, and how they relate; take notes.</p>

					<p class="BoxBodyFirst">We advise you to document conventions, onboarding procedures, and other oral traditions on your team. You will get a lot of comments and corrections. Do not take the comments personally. The point is not to write a perfect document but rather to write enough to trigger a discussion that fleshes out the details. This is a variation of <em>Cunningham’s law,</em> which states that “the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it’s to post the wrong answer.”</p>
					<p>
						Be prepared for trivial discussions to become drawn out, a phenomenon called <em>bike-shedding</em>. Bike-shedding is an allegory by C. Northcote Parkinson, describing a committee assigned to review designs for a power plant. The committee approves the plans within minutes, as they are too complex to actually discuss. They then spend 45 minutes discussing the materials for the bike shed next to the plant. Bike-shedding comes up a lot in technical work.</p>

			<p>Some companies have additional new software engineer onboarding processes to help you get access to systems, set up your development environment, and check out and build code. If no such process exists, you have an opportunity to create one! Write down what you do as you set up. (See Chapter 2, “Getting to Conscious Competence.”)</p>
			<p>You should get assigned a small task to learn the basics of making a code change and shepherding it into production. If not, look or ask for some useful—but minor—change to make. It can be as small as updating a comment; the goal is to understand the steps, not to impress. (See Chapter 2, “Getting to Conscious Competence,” and Chapter 8, “Delivering Software.”)</p>
			<p>
				Set up your code editor or IDE. Use the IDE that your team uses; if you don’t know it, find a tutorial online. Learning your IDE will save you a lot <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_5" title="5"/>of time later. Configure your IDE to apply team code formatting conventions; ask what they are and how to apply them. (See Chapter 3, “Working with Code.”)</p>
			<p>Make sure your manager adds you to team and company meetings—stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives, all-hands, and so on. Remind your manager to schedule a one-on-one meeting if they conduct them. (See Chapter 12, “Agile Planning,” and Chapter 13, “Working with Managers.”)</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c01-0002">Ramp-Up River</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Once you’ve completed newbie tasks, you’ll take on your first real work for the team. You will probably work on an existing codebase. What you find might confuse or intimidate you. Ask questions, and have your team review your work frequently. (See Chapter 3, “Working with Code,” and Chapter 7, “Code Reviews.”)</p>
			<p>Learning is critical as you ramp up. Investigate how code is built, tested, and deployed. Read pull requests and code reviews. Don’t be afraid to ask for more information. Sign up for tech talks, brown bags, reading groups, mentorship programs, and the like. (See Chapter 2, “Getting to Conscious Competence”; Chapter 5, “Managing Dependencies”; Chapter 6, “Testing”; and Chapter 8, “Delivering Software.”)</p>
			<p>Now is the time to build a relationship with your manager. Get to know their working style, understand their expectations, and talk to them about your goals. If your manager does one-on-ones, expect to have your first few sessions. Managers usually want to track progress, so ask your manager how to communicate status. (See Chapter 13, “Working with Managers.”)</p>
			<p>You’ll probably also attend your first planning session, usually a sprint planning meeting. You might also join retrospective or all-hands meetings. Ask for an overview of the roadmap and development planning process. (See Chapter 12, “Agile Planning.”)</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c01-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_6" title="6"/>Cape Contributor</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">You’ll enter Cape Contributor once you begin working on larger tasks and features. The team trusts you to work more independently. Learn how to write production-grade code that’s operator friendly, properly manages dependencies, and has clean tests. (See Chapter 3, “Working with Code”; Chapter 4, “Writing Operable Code”; Chapter 5, “Managing Dependencies”; and Chapter 6, “Testing.”)</p>
			<p>You should be helping teammates now, too. Get involved in code reviews, and expect teammates to ask for ideas and feedback. Your team might forget that you’ve joined recently, so ask questions when you’re confused. (See Chapter 2, “Getting to Conscious Competence”; Chapter 7, “Code Reviews”; and Chapter 10, “Technical Design Process.”)</p>
			<p>Most companies have quarterly planning and goal-setting cycles. Participate in team planning, and work with your manager to set goals or objectives and key results (OKRs). (See Chapter 12, “Agile Planning,” and Chapter 13, “Working with Managers.”)</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c01-0004">Operations Ocean</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">You’ll learn more about how code is delivered to users as you work on larger tasks. A lot happens during delivery: testing, build, release, deployment, and rollout. Finessing this process takes skill. (See Chapter 8, “Delivering Software.”)</p>
			<p>After rolling out your changes, you’ll have to operate your team’s software. Operations work is high stress and takes grit; customers will be impacted by instability. You’ll debug live software using metrics, logs, and trace tools. You might also enter an on-call rotation at this point. Exposure to operational work will show you how code behaves in users’ hands, and you’ll learn to protect your software. (See Chapter 4, “Writing Operable Code,” and Chapter 9, “Going On-Call.”)</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c01-0005"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_7" title="7"/>Competence Cove</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Your team will count on you to drive a small project now. You’ll need to write a technical design document and help with project planning. Designing software will expose you to a new level of complexity. Don’t settle for your first design; explore trade-offs and plan for your system to evolve over time. (See Chapter 10, “Technical Design Process”; Chapter 11, “Creating Evolvable Architectures”; and Chapter 12, “Agile Planning.”)</p>
			<p>Some of the early shine of your job has worn off. You see flaws in the architecture, the build and deploy system, and the testing environment. You are learning to balance regular work with necessary maintenance and refactoring. Don’t try to rewrite everything. (See Chapter 3, “Working with Code.”)</p>
			<p>You also have thoughts about team processes. Write down your observations—what’s working and what isn’t—and discuss your ideas in a one-on-one with your manager. (See Chapter 13, “Working with Managers.”)</p>
			<p>Now is also the time to work on longer-term goal setting and performance reviews. Work with your manager to understand the process and get feedback from peers. Discuss career aspirations, future work, projects, and ideas with your manager. (See Chapter 13, “Working with Managers,” and Chapter 14, “Navigating Your Career.”)</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c01-0003">Onward!</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">You now have both a map and destination for your beginner’s journey. After landing at Competence Cove, you’ll be a full-fledged software engineer capable of working with your team to deliver valuable features. The remainder of the book will help you navigate the path. Our journey begins.</p>

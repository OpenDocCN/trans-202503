- en: Today, we take it for granted that there’s a place we go to buy our apps. You
    have a phone, you want an app—you go to the application store to get it. Obviously.

- en: It’s not that companies didn’t want it to exist; they kept trying to create
    something like it. You could buy services from carriers (mostly ringtones and
    simple utilities), and there were various repositories for games. But the market
    for apps wasn’t there (since there wasn’t a lot that apps could do on those limited
    devices, at that time), so users weren’t missing much. But once there were devices
    powerful enough to run real applications, users needed an easy way to get them.

- en: But carriers had created *walled gardens*^([1](#c22-footnote-1)) where they
    controlled access to the earlier app stores. They wanted to ensure that malicious
    or bad apps couldn’t take down their network, so they didn’t want random applications
    running on their network that they could not control. They created curated places,
    like the app store on the Danger phones. But that extra layer of process and hassle
    dissuaded many developers from uploading apps, and prevented larger app store
    ecosystems from coming into being.

    that anyone could upload apps to. Michael Morrissey, who was leading the services
    team on Android, told Nick Sears his goal: “I want a fourteen-year-old kid sitting
    in Kansas to be able to write an app in the morning and upload it in the afternoon
    to Android Market and have it go out to sell to all the customers.”'

    the G1). How could they verify that that kid in Kansas couldn’t upload something
    that would take down their network?

- en: And so began a long discussion between Android and T-Mobile to iron out the
    details that would make this work. There were two things that the Android team
    had to do to get T-Mobile to agree. First was assuring T-Mobile that their network
    would be safe. Second was allowing them to have their own curated app store, alongside
    Android’s.

- en: The first item, safety, began with having a secure platform. Given the kernel-level
    sandboxing of apps, the team was able to convince the carrier that Linux security
    standards would be sufficient. Next, the team required that developers actually
    sign in, and used existing infrastructure and policies vetted on YouTube to validate
    that the individual did not present an unreasonable risk for the company. Also,
    they used the power of crowd-sourcing, putting in place a system whereby users
    could report bad apps and the team would take them down. Finally, they convinced
    the carrier that, as much as T-Mobile would suffer if they had network problems,
    so would Google. Android’s, and Google’s, reputation was on the line. So Android
    had all the right incentives to make this system work and for the apps and network
    to be secure and safe.

- en: For the second item, a custom store for T-Mobile, Google created what Nick called,
    “a store within a store.” The actual application store was on Google’s infrastructure,
    but T-Mobile was offered primary placement within the store for a limited set
    of apps that they curated. This placated T-Mobile enough to get them to that first
    release. But eventually this just went away; other carriers didn’t demand this
    as part of their deals, and everyone realized that there was no particular reason
    for this requirement. All of the work was on Google to manage that infrastructure,
    and the open application store system seemed to be working.

    an application store on the platform. Now they just had to build it.

- en: The application store for Android was developed in the services team, which
    was responsible for Google services and device management. But the team hired
    other people to figure out how to host and sell applications. The project was
    called *vending machine* internally. When it launched, it was called Android Market.^([2](#c22-footnote-2))

- en: Having an application store was always part of the plan. But the project started
    late, since the top priority was shipping the 1.0 release and the G1\. When the
    G1 launched, Market was there, but it was clearly not a finished product. For
    one thing, it was called Market Beta.^([3](#c22-footnote-3)) More significant,
    users couldn’t actually purchase applications. Instead, all apps could be downloaded
    for a cost of . . . $0\. While the mechanisms of developers uploading their apps
    to Market and users downloading apps to their phones worked, the additional step
    of charging users (and paying developers) took more time and effort. The initial
    version of Market was great for users who want free stuff, but it wasn’t as good
    for developers, who usually want to be paid for their efforts.^([4](#c22-footnote-4))

- en: The team brought in some much-needed expertise from the Google payments team.
    Arturo Crespo helped pull together the necessary infrastructure that allowed Market
    to process payments for applications. By the time Android 1.1 launched, in February
    of 2009, Market had the ability to sell applications (and developers had the ability
    to make money from their Android apps).

- en: Market was one of the attractions of Android in the early days. It was easy
    to upload an application to the store and make it available to the growing set
    of Android users. Dan Lew, an external Android developer working on travel apps
    at the time, said, “I worked on a bunch of silly side project apps. Android was
    a good place for that because putting up a nearly pointless app on the Play Store
    is relatively painless.”

- en: But Market was more than a convenience for developers and for users; it helped
    create a world of apps that made Android a powerful ecosystem that went way beyond
    the phones people bought and the operating system running on those phones. Users
    were able to benefit from not just the basic phone and built-in capabilities,
    but also from the almost limitless potential of apps that they could install.
    It was Android Market that helped create this powerful dynamic for the Android
    platform overall.

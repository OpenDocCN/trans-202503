<p class="CO">Nearly every day, we receive calls from clients who tell us things like “The board asked us to perform a tabletop exercise by the end of the year” or “Our auditors want us to test our incident response process, and we don’t know how.”</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Chances are, if you’ve picked up this book, you, too, have been tasked with helping your organization prepare for a future cybersecurity incident, perhaps through the use of a tabletop exercise. In a <i>tabletop exercise</i>, members of an organization gather to discuss how they would respond to a potential future event or emergency. We’ll dive into the specific characteristics of cybersecurity tabletop exercises in more detail in <span class="Xref1"><a href="chapter1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a></span>, but in brief, most contain the following features:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">They’re usually purely discussion-based exercises. This sets them apart from red-teaming drills or other operations-based exercises, which require hands-on activities.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">They focus on exploring a specific scenario, such as a past event or a hypothetical incident inspired by plausible risks to the organization.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xx" aria-label="xx"/>They gather participants in a low-stress environment that emphasizes collaboration and the identification of deficiencies. To that end, they’re designed to encourage participation and solicit feedback.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">They enable participants to evaluate the organization’s decision-making process, as well as its existing procedures and documentation. They also let participants discuss their individual roles and respective functional interests during a potential incident.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">While such an exercise might seem straightforward, every organization is unique, with its own culture, regulatory environment, industry vertical, and risk landscape. To have maximum value, the exercise must consider and accommodate the organization’s unique needs.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">We wrote this book based on our experience delivering hundreds of tabletop exercises as consultants for numerous types of organizations, including nonprofits, manufacturing firms, regional banks, utility companies, educational institutions, and governments at various levels. In it, you’ll find examples of tabletop exercises suited to different purposes, as well as detailed guidance on how to plan, facilitate, and learn from them. The considerations we discuss herein should help you make your tabletop exercise process smoother and deliver the greatest benefit to your organization.</p>&#13;

<h2 class="H1" id="sec1"><span id="h-1"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Who Should Read This Book and Why</span></h2>&#13;
<p class="TNI">This book has several audiences in mind. The first is information security professionals and those in related roles who are tasked with creating and facilitating a tabletop exercise for their employer. These individuals might need help executing their organization’s first tabletop exercise, or they might want to improve their performance in an ongoing series of exercises. Moreover, the people tasked with developing these exercises most likely have other job responsibilities, so in many organizations, it is difficult to perform a tabletop exercise more than once a year, and those overseeing them may have little opportunity to become experts in the topic.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">We also target information security consultants who serve as external resources for other organizations seeking to perform a tabletop exercise. Companies that provide information security services frequently receive requests for help creating and facilitating a tabletop exercise. Given our extensive background in information security consulting, we would be remiss if we didn’t include the lessons we’ve learned from the consulting side.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Finally, while we’ve approached the book with information security in mind, you could adapt much of the process we discuss to other facets of the organization. Non–information security exercises might evaluate the organization’s readiness for business continuity issues (such as the impact of a sustained power outage at an assisted care facility) or physical security events, for example.</p>&#13;

<h2 class="H1" id="sec2"><span id="h-2"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">What’s in This Book</span></h2>&#13;
<p class="TNI">This book is split into two sections. <a href="part1.xhtml">Part I</a> provides guidance on how to plan and execute a tabletop exercise, while <a href="part2.xhtml">Part II</a> contains sample exercise scenarios that you could leverage for your own events, along with suggestions for adapting them.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><a href="part1.xhtml">Part I</a> is organized linearly. It begins by discussing why you might want to pursue a tabletop exercise in the first place, then covers the planning and scenario development steps, techniques for successfully facilitating the exercise, and ways to evaluate the event’s success.</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b><a href="chapter1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, Why Perform Tabletop Exercises?</b> In some organizations, you’ll need to create the business case for performing a tabletop exercise, and this chapter will help bolster your argument. We’ll explore how tabletop exercises can help an organization align with standards, practice for the inevitable bad day, evaluate the policy implications of a cybersecurity incident, examine technical controls, and identify process deficiencies.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b><a href="chapter2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, Planning the Tabletop Exercise</b> This chapter contains many of the foundational activities that need to occur well before the tabletop exercise itself. These involve defining goals and objectives, determining whom to invite, addressing logistical concerns, and crafting a robust and multifaceted communications plan to engage all stakeholders.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b><a href="chapter3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, The Development Process: Where the Rubber Meets the Road</b> With the key planning tasks complete, you can now develop the tabletop exercise. This chapter outlines the steps for constructing the tabletop exercise, including selecting a scenario and breaking it down into logical injects—a set of new or clarifying facts about the scenario—that force attendees to respond to events with limited information. This chapter also discusses how to create the presentation deck.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b><a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, Facilitating a Successful Tabletop Exercise</b> For some, facilitating a tabletop exercise can seem daunting. You might find it intimidating to speak in front of your colleagues (some of whom you might be meeting for the first time) to discuss the actions they would take during a crisis. This chapter will provide tips for successfully delivering a tabletop exercise, encouraging group participation, and making the discussion as valuable as possible.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b><a href="chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, Acting on What You’ve Learned: Evaluation and Next Steps</b> After you’ve completed the tabletop exercise, it’s time to evaluate your successes and identify opportunities for improvement. This chapter covers how to review the lessons learned from the exercise and develop an action plan to remedy shortcomings. We’ll also discuss strategies for maintaining your momentum to ensure the tabletop doesn’t become a one-off, check-the-box affair.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxii" aria-label="xxii"/><a href="part2.xhtml">Part II</a> contains examples of tabletop exercises designed for technical and executive audiences, as well as other roles in an organization. These examples can serve as inspiration for those seeking to perform their own tabletop exercises. For each exercise sample, we offer possible modifications that should help you adapt the scenario to your organization’s particular needs.</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b><a href="chapter6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, Engaging a Technical Audience</b> These tabletop exercises are excellent options to present to a technical audience, as they hit on many of the common technical questions that emerge during incident response efforts. The scenarios include phishing, ransomware, a zero-day vulnerability, and a supply chain compromise.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b><a href="chapter7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, Engaging an Executive Audience</b> The scenarios in this chapter incorporate many of the issues that are important for an executive audience to consider. We consider the managerial aspects of a ransomware response, the discovery of sensitive data on the dark web, and distributed denial-of-service attacks.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b><a href="chapter8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, Engaging the Business</b> It’s often important for a tabletop exercise to include other teams in an organization, such as human resources and physical security. The scenarios in this chapter cover a physical security breach, a social media compromise, and an insider threat.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="TX">The <a href="appendix.xhtml">appendix</a> contains helpful report templates, which can be used to show internal and external stakeholders that a tabletop exercise was performed and provide details of the scenario exercises as well as findings or observations that were uncovered. Throughout the book, you’ll find case studies discussing tabletops that went according to plan—and, occasionally, ones that went awry. We’ve included these examples so that you can learn from the efforts of others. While we’ve fictionalized these stories and the names of the organizations involved, the events are based on actual engagements we’ve undertaken in our careers.</p>&#13;

<h2 class="H1" id="sec3"><span id="h-3"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">The Book’s Scope</span></h2>&#13;
<p class="TNI">The security community widely considers tabletop exercises a necessity to reduce the risks an organization faces. For this reason, many authorities—including the US Department of Homeland Security, the International Organization for Standardization, the French National Agency for the Security of Information Systems, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology—have released guidelines on preparing for disasters using tabletop exercises.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">These agencies have similar definitions and processes for performing security exercises. For consistency, however, this book uses those created by the United States’ Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP), which defines an exercise as “an event or activity, delivered through discussion or action, to develop, assess, or validate plans, policies, <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxiii" aria-label="xxiii"/>procedures, and capabilities that jurisdictions/organizations can use to achieve planned outcomes.”</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">A subset of the previously defined exercise includes discussion-based exercises, which would include tabletop exercises, as well as seminars, workshops, and games. According to HSEEP, discussion-based exercises tend to include teams new to incident response, or teams that want to become acquainted with new plans, procedures, or other team members. Nevertheless, mature teams should not discount the value of discussion-based exercises. These exercises are usually led by facilitators and constrained by a shorter execution window (for example, two hours). While HSEEP states that discussion-based exercises tend to focus on “strategic, policy-oriented” issues, they can just as easily include technical discussions.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">One final note on the book’s scope: we’ve spent most of our careers working in North America and Europe. As a result, the standards and practices we discuss come from agencies in these regions. If you’re performing tabletop exercises elsewhere, consider the advice of the industry authorities in your area to supplement the discussions in this book.</p>&#13;

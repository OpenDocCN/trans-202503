    what the user sees on web pages and in what happens behind the scenes, such as
    processing form submissions, talking to other websites, and interacting with databases.
    The language was first released in 1995, but it wasn’t until the late 2000s, when
    my computing students encouraged me to introduce PHP into their web programming
    classes, that I began working with it in earnest. They wanted to improve their
    skill profiles for the job market, since they felt the internet was going to continue
    to grow in importance in the work of computing. Clearly, they were right.  ##

- en: '*PHP Crash Course* is for anyone wanting to learn PHP programming in a practical,
    hands-on way, regardless of whether you have previous programming experience.
    Since most PHP programs are web applications, knowing about the HyperText Markup
    Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) languages used to represent the
    content and visual style of web pages might prove helpful, but you don’t need
    to know any web programming, such as JavaScript.'

- en: PHP is currently in its eighth major version, so as well as being tried and
    tested, it’s faster and more secure than ever before. It’s a free, open source,
    and well-maintained language. While other popular web programming languages are
    available, about 70 percent of the web is run by PHP programs, including Etsy,
    Facebook (using its dialect of PHP, called Hack), Spotify, Wikipedia, and WordPress.

    a few lines of code, and once you’re comfortable with the basics, we’ll move on
    to larger, more structured web application systems.

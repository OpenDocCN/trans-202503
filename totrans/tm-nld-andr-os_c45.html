<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">T</span>he marketplace success of the Motorola Droid was the first sign that maybe Android would do all right. Android had been slowly gaining in adoption and acceptance, but the Droid was the first hugely successful Android-based product, especially in the US. One element that distinguished the Droid from previous Android devices was that it was the first one with a real marketing campaign. Verizon spent $100 million on marketing and covered the airwaves with their commercials for “Droid Does.”</p>
<p>Launched on October 17, 2009, and released in early November, the Droid became a commercial success, as consumers took Android phones more seriously. At the same time, partners also took Android more seriously, eventually resulting in other products (<em>many</em> other products) that pushed sales of Android-based devices even further.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_344" title="344"/>Michael Morrissey remembered the impact of the launch: “We were small and scrappy and churning out all these OS updates and it didn’t feel like we were getting a hit at all with consumers. And then the Droid had this big first day. And then the second day was very similar to the first, it was maybe like 65,000 [devices sold]. But then it was like, ‘Oh God, what’s going to happen now? Is that it? Were these just super-excited early adopters, and it’s going to go away?’ But the numbers continued to be pretty good. My recollection of numbers is bad, but it was like 30,000 a day for a long time. Once that kept going and the Droid was really, really big, it was like ‘We’re going somewhere now.’”</p>

<p>But Droid development looked quite different on the inside of the Android team. At first, it was a product that nobody wanted. At the same time that Motorola approached Google to work on this device together, HTC had also approached Google to work together on the Passion phone (which was eventually released as the Nexus One). The team was much more excited about the Passion device because it was going to be a Google-branded phone, with more ownership and control over the final product.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_345" title="345"/>Meanwhile, the Droid languished without love internally. Andy Rubin didn’t even want to do the deal to begin with, for various reasons including the carrier network details. Rich Miner recalled, “Andy didn’t want to do CDMA [the Verizon cell phone network technology] because all of our first phones on T-Mo were GSM. We [Rich and Hiroshi] had to get that thing far enough along basically against Andy’s desire so that it had enough momentum that it was clear that we shouldn’t stop it.”</p>
<p>Wei Huang remembers the tension between the Droid and the Nexus One: “Andy was more into Nexus One because it’s the product he imagined. It was a better device, I think.” </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Nexus One would have more co-branding support than the Droid. Verizon wanted the Droid to be a Verizon device, and the main brands associated with it were Verizon (the carrier) and Motorola (the manufacturer). The Google brand was not on the Droid.</p>
<p>Not only was the Droid suffering from a branding and ownership standpoint, it was . . . ugly. Tom Moss said, “It was all sharp edges. You could cut yourself on the corners.”</p>
<p>But marketing can help, and the marketing campaign for Droid did just that. The campaign capitalized on the unique aspects of the device, and made that potential weakness its strength, pitching it as a robotic device that did so much more than the competition. It apparently worked, and people bought Droids in much larger quantities in the US than had bought any other Android phones before. The days of Android being outsold hugely by the competition were over, as the market share of Android continued to grow, overtaking iPhone sales completely by the end of 2010.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c45-footnote-1" id="c45-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Cédric Beust commented on the Droid versus Nexus competition internally: “So we’re all feeling a bit smug and saying, ‘Yeah, we’re doing Verizon, but it’s more because we need to put money on the table. But really the thing that matters is the Nexus.’ Google, or Android, was arrogant enough to think that just selling our phone on our website<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c45-footnote-2" id="c45-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup> was good enough. Looking back, it was so naive.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_346" title="346"/>“Then we were shown the first TV commercial,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c45-footnote-3" id="c45-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup> which impressed a lot of us. It was a pretty freaking good commercial. And the Droid ended up being a huge success, our phone [the Nexus One] not doing well. I think it was a very humbling lesson for all of us. We started realizing the importance of product and marketing, and understanding that maybe it was time to pass the baton. We’d been driven by technical things. The technical foundation is here; now we need to let the real market take over. People like Verizon were going to take it to the next level.”</p>
<p>Charles Mendis agreed. “Their marketing campaign was really interesting.</p>
<p>“Initially, Andy and Larry in particular wanted to sell this Droid as a much cheaper device. They wanted this to be the device for everyone. But Verizon was like, ‘We don’t have the iPhone. We can’t sell this as a cheap device, from a brand and marketing point of view. We have to be seen as being as good as the other one.’”</p>
<p>Verizon came up with a marketing plan for the Droid and presented it to the team. Charles said, “I felt like a cheaper device would have been better. But Verizon did an amazing job. They hit it spot-on. And the sales and the reception showed that.”</p>
<p>Another aspect that Charles felt contributed to the Droid’s success was the priority placed on it internally. Initially, the Droid and the Nexus One were going to launch at the same time. But eventually the decision was made to get the Droid out first, then launch the Nexus One afterward. The Droid launched in November of 2009, and the Nexus One came out two months later, in January.</p>
<p>“Kicking Nexus One out to the next year was another big part of what made Droid successful. Before, there was a confusion in the team: should I work on the Nexus One bug or the Droid bug? The Nexus One is the company’s device.</p>
<p>“Andy ended up making the difficult decision. Saying ‘Nexus One is going to be after, the whole team should work on the Droid’ really helped us land Droid as a device.”</p>
<p>The Droid’s hardware performance also helped. Charles Mendis said, “One of the biggest problems [on the G1] we had in Maps was the cache <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_347" title="347"/>would blow up. We’d get ‘Out of Memory’ exceptions, and the app would die while you were using it. We did a bunch of stuff to get around it, but there just wasn’t enough RAM to work with. When the Droid came in, we could actually deliver the experience.</p>
<p>“In G1, we were forced to develop in such a tightly constrained thing that when the Droid came out, things actually worked well because we had targeted G1. I felt like the G1 was almost like a Beta product, forcing the team to be on very tight constraints. The experience [on the Droid] was pretty nice because we built for a much tighter environment.”</p>
<p>Another aspect of the Droid hardware that was significant for Android was the screen. The Droid was the first device with a screen size (480 <span class="NSSymbol">×</span> 854) that differed from that of the original G1 (320 <span class="NSSymbol">×</span> 480). Also, the Droid had a higher pixel density than the earlier devices (265 versus 180 pixels per inch). This meant that developers could, for the first time, see the advantage of building their apps in a way that scaled to different screen form factors automatically.</p>
<p>The Droid was the <em>hockey stick</em><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c45-footnote-4" id="c45-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup> moment for Android, where the adoption curve of Android hit a swiftly increasing slope. Hiroshi recalled: “I remember reading an article that came out maybe a day or two after the Droid had launched, where the reporter had interviewed some app developer who had published on iPhone, iOS and had already published on Market. They were saying, ‘Wow, we’re noticing the Droid already.’ Like two days in, the developer saying, ‘Our installs are going way up on Android.’ It was also a moment, not only a consumer moment, but also for developers, where they were like, ‘Shit, this platform might have legs. There are people who are buying these things.’”</p>
<p>The Droid launched in November. A couple of months later, Dave Sparks remembered a staff meeting he attended. “It was right after the launch, like <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_348" title="348"/>January, and we were just starting to see the hockey stick. Eric Schmidt called a meeting of Andy’s staff. I remember Dianne was there and Mike Cleron, basically all the big wigs. Hiroshi, obviously.</p>
<p>“Eric looked around the room and said, ‘Don’t fuck this up.’”</p>

It’s a visual indicator in a graph that the slope increases sharply, much like the hockey stick changes its slope between the heel and the shaft.
Of course, this only works if you hold the stick in the right orientation. Upside-down, a hockey stick graph could indicate that sales have plummeted sharply. But I don’t think that’s what the marketing folks meant in these meetings.</p></aside>

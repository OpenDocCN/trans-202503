    But man, the competition: it never ends. It’s relentless. Every day we’re competing.'

    Android succeed?”

- en: But “success” is not really the right word, or even the right concept. In any
    project, success is never guaranteed, no matter how great things look at any given
    moment. This is even more true in tech, where changes in hardware, software, fashion,
    consumer interest, or any of a million other things can send a seemingly successful
    product into the sinkhole of obsolescence almost overnight. Things change so quickly
    in this field that there is never a sense of “We made it!,” but rather a slightly
    nervous, “We’re still here!,” or maybe even a doubtful, “We’re still here?,” while
    looking over your shoulder to see who’s behind you and how fast they’re catching
    up.

- en: For Android, the platform gained enough traction with manufacturers, carriers,
    developers, and users to be allowed to continue to exist and improve over the
    last several years. And in high tech, that’s about as good as it gets.

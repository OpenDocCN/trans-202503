<p class="noindent">You made it to the final chapter! How does it feel to be a game designer? A little weird? Don’t worry—that’s normal. Maybe you don’t <em>feel</em> like a game designer yet. That’s normal too.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It’s easy to feel like you’re not qualified to call yourself something. But there are so many different ways to be a game designer. For example, game designers can be people who work at big companies where everyone makes small contributions to a product. Game designers can also be people who sit in their bedrooms making things that they find fun.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_70"/>Game designers are also people who go to the park to play catch with friends, and then wonder, “What if we have to toss the ball under our leg?” or “What if we’re not allowed to touch the ball with our hands?” There are a million-and-a-half different ways to be a game designer.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev55">Asking Questions</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You might not have a ton of game design experience yet, but I’ll tell you a cool fact about game design: if you’re doing it right, it should <em>always</em> remain a mystery to you. Even the people who’ve designed games for years are still asking questions about what games could be. “What if you can only move one space every day?” “What kind of game can you play at a protest?” “Why don’t games let you make friends with the monsters instead of fighting them?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Game design is less about finding answers than it is about asking questions. Everyone, regardless of their skill level and experience, can ask questions.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this chapter, I’ll show you some cool Twine games other people have made as well as provide you with some exercises to try when you’re making your own games.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f094-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev56"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_71"/>More Twine Games to Try</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You learned how to build some Twine games from scratch and share them online. Even if you don’t think your game is perfect, you should be proud that you’ve <em>made something</em>. Many adults who have been making games for way longer than you still have a hard time finishing them.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But this is only your first Twine game. What will your next one be like? Keep your mind open so new ideas can get in. Ideas might find you when you’re walking in the park, when you’re staring at the ceiling over your bed, or even when you’re in the bathroom. Never be too quick to dismiss a daydream; it could be the seed for an amazing game!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the meantime, here are a few more Twine game examples you can try to see what’s possible with Twine; perhaps you’ll want to make a similar Twine game.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev57">Candy Ant Princess by Whisperbat</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In <em>Candy Ant Princess</em>, you get to make lots of little decisions that don’t change the game much but help you feel like the story you’re playing is your own story. Try it now at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/candyant"><em>https://tinyurl.com/candyant</em></a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f095-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_72"/>You can choose what your candy ant princess looks like, what kind of candy pet you have, and where you make your candy ant nest. These small details help you decide what your candy ant princess is like and how she sees herself in candy ant society.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev58">The Message by Jeremy Lonien and Dominik Johann</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>The Message</em> is a short game that manages to build up a lot of suspense before—well, I don’t want to spoil the ending! This game uses text formatting and pictures in very smart ways to help create its mood. Cleverly, it also provides a link to a YouTube video full of space sounds recorded by NASA that you can leave open as a soundtrack while you play the game. Check it out at <a href="http://ludonaut.de/the-message/"><em>http://ludonaut.de/the-message/</em></a>.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev59">A Bucket Filled with Sand by A. C. Godliman</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>A Bucket Filled with Sand</em> is a game about history, destiny, and sandcastles (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/bucketsand/"><em>http://tinyurl.com/bucketsand/</em></a>). It uses lots of pictures to show how your sand kingdom grows and changes. It’s a good example of a game in which little choices you make between one option and another lead you down different branches and paths. You might need to give the game a minute to load all the pictures.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Sometimes when you look at stuff other people have made, you can easily get discouraged. You might think to yourself, “Well, that’s way better than anything I could make.” I know, because I think that all the time.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But there’s another way to think about the cool things other people make. You could say, “Wow, I didn’t know you could do that! But now I do! The next thing I make will be <em>so much cooler</em> because of it!”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The more you explore other people’s games, the more likely you’ll be to think of ideas and designs you’ve never thought of before, and the more you’ll learn about what you can make. In fact, every little thing you learn about or play with can make you better at creating your own games because they help fuel new ideas during the planning stage.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_73"/>So don’t let other peoples’ art scare you into thinking you can’t do something similarly cool. Give yourself permission to learn from others’ work. The more Twine games you play, the more ideas you’ll get! I’ve been making games with Twine for years, and I’m still coming up with more ideas.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev60">Game Challenges</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When you’re done exploring these games, here are some exercises you can try. Some of them are about challenging yourself to make a game in a new way. Some challenge you to promote your games and work with others. Each challenge starts with a question. And each of those questions, hopefully, will lead you to ask more questions of your own.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Don’t worry about completing every one or doing them in order. Do the ones that most excite you and lead you to the most interesting questions.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev61">Write a Story to Fit a Cool Shape</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In previous chapters, you learned how to write a Twine story and then rearrange the passages into a cool shape, like a lightning bolt or spiral.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For this challenge, try reversing the process. For example, come up with the overall shape of your Twine blueprint first by creating passages before writing in them. Then go back and fill in the passages to create a story. Let the shape of the story guide what you write! What would be in a Twine game shaped like a heart? Or a star? How would the passages connect?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This approach might seem counterintuitive, but it’ll challenge you to write more creatively. If you’re stuck in a rut and are having trouble coming up with a new idea, a challenge like this could be just what you need to shake some ideas loose.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev62">Tell a Story with Just Pictures</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">For this challenge, you’ll need a way to get your drawings onto a computer if you prefer to draw by hand. Or you can just draw them right on your computer using a paint program.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_74"/>Now, can you write a Twine story that’s all pictures with no text whatsoever? (It’s okay if the links are words.) If you’re not sure where to begin, here’s a fun idea: using a game you’ve already written in words, translate it into pictures. How is the game design process different or similar? For example, how do you provide different choices to the player using a picture?</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong>TIP</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep">Instead of uploading your images one by one to <a href="https://postimage.org/"><span class="colorpink"><em>https://postimage.org/</em></span></a>, which is tedious, why not register a <a href="https://neocities.org/"><span class="colorpink"><em>https://neocities.org/</em></span></a> page for your game and upload all the images there at once?</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev63">Make Your Twine Story into a Booklet!</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Try making a paper version of your Twine game to share with your friends. For example, in a physical version of your game, instead of using links, you might need to tell the reader to turn to page 4 or page 15. How would your story be different when someone is holding it in their hands instead of playing it on a computer? What can you do on paper that’s hard to do on the computer?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">One cool idea would be to tell a riddle and have the reader turn the page upside down to read the answer. If you draw a comic book and number all the panels, you can tell the reader to go to a specific panel. You can even leave a blank spot for them to write in their own ending!</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev64">Collaborate with Friends</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Try making a game with a friend. It can be very exciting to bounce ideas back and forth with someone else. Each of you can build on what the other has come up with. Some of the most powerful ideas emerge that way, and the energy of collaboration can be really fun.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There are a lot of different ways to work together on a project. For example, you can write the first half of the game, and your friend can write the second part. Or maybe you write the passage descriptions, and your partner writes the links. You could write the story, and someone else could draw the pictures. Maybe you could just have someone read your story and offer ideas.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_75"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f099-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Working with other people on creative projects can be tricky, especially when they’re your friends. If you get into an argument about the project, it could affect your friendship outside of it. Collaborating feels great when you both have the same level of energy and excitement, but tensions can build when you both have different amounts of energy or availability. At times, you might see one person taking charge of the whole project and making all the decisions.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Collaboration</em> is all about communication! If someone doesn’t feel like they’re involved enough in decision making or feels frustrated because they think they’re spending more time on the project than the other person, have a conversation about it! Offer constructive criticism without getting defensive: try to be specific about what the problem is, how it makes you feel, and what could make the situation better.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Collaboration is a lot of work, but it can lead to amazing things you couldn’t make on your own.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev65">Make a Journal Game</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Have you ever kept a journal? <em>Journaling</em> is when you write down what happened that day, what was important about it, how it made you feel, and why. What if you tried to make a game from your journal? For example, how would you make something that happened to you interactive?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_76"/>You can make a journal game about almost anything! Moving to a new town. Having a little sister. Making friends with a cat. Being different. Winning a spelling bee. Losing a spelling bee. Breaking your arm. Or just watching the sunset. Games don’t always have to be about spider milk and ghost burgers. They can be about you, too!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Because a journal game can be very personal, think about what you’re comfortable sharing with other people and what you want to keep to yourself. You can certainly make a game that’s meant just for you: what would that look like? What about a game you make to share with just one friend? Not every game is for everyone.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev66">Make Games with Bitsy</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Bitsy is a cute little game maker by Adam Le Doux. Like Twine, Bitsy lets you write words and put them in a game. It also lets you draw little characters, scenery, and animation and make little worlds out of them. If you want to take what you’ve done with Twine and add a more <em>visual</em> dimension to it, Bitsy could be a fun next step!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can find the Bitsy editor online at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bitsyeditor/"><em>http://tinyurl.com/bitsyeditor/</em></a>. For an example of what you can do with Bitsy, try playing the game <em>You Have to Go to Work</em> by KC at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bitsywork/"><em>http://tinyurl.com/bitsywork/</em></a>.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="lev67"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_77"/>Keep Exploring and Creating!</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The world we live in is not always the best place, and it can be easy to lose hope and joy. Making art—whether that’s games, comics, zines, music, stories, or just a little garden in your window—helps us remember that we’re capable of creating beautiful things. It reminds us to feel wonder for our surroundings and ourselves.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The older you get, the less time you have for play and creating things that don’t make money. Get in the habit of making and doing, and hold onto it as you grow older! It’s never too late to start. Making art will increase your enjoyment for life. <em>For real.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But this book is just a starting point. Now that you know how to make games using Twine, it’s up to you to figure out what to do with that knowledge. Follow your ideas wherever they lead you, even if they seem silly, weird, or unoriginal. Keep exploring.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I can’t wait to see what you come up with.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_78"/></p>&#13;

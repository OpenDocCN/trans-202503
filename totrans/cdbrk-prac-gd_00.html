<p class="BodyFirst">We both have an interest in classical ciphers and codebreaking, so it was pretty much inevitable that our paths would cross someday. This happened in October 2009, when we attended the NSA Symposium on Cryptologic History in Laurel, Maryland. During the first networking session, we realized that we had much in common. This was the start of a friendship that is still enduring, although we live in different parts of the world and are separated by about 4,000 miles, as well as lots of water (the Atlantic Ocean), with Elonka in Rockville, Maryland, near Washington, DC, and Klaus in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. We still meet regularly in Maryland at the biennial NSA Symposium on Cryptologic History and other events.</p>
<p>In 2017, on one such visit, we took a spur-of-the-moment, multi-hour road trip down to southern Virginia in order to explore a famous cipher mystery: the Beale ciphers (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 6">Chapter 6</span>). This story, about a hidden treasure and three encrypted messages that describe its location, is probably a mere hoax, but at least it’s a tantalizing one. We went to Bedford, Virginia, to conduct research at its library, which had a collection of Beale memorabilia. Then, we ate dinner at Beale’s Beer restaurant, sitting next to a large map that showed the notable places of the Beale story (Figure 1).</p>

<p>On our five-hour return trip from Bedford to Washington, DC, by car, we talked, among other things, about codebreaking literature and the regrettable fact that no up-to-date book about this topic was available. What we wished for was a work that covered the solving of authentic ciphertexts, which we kept encountering in the form of encrypted postcards, letters, telegrams, diaries, journals, and other documents from the past few hundred years. Deciphering such cryptograms always provides a firsthand glimpse into a moment of history—something even the best crossword puzzle or Rubik’s Cube cannot do.</p>
<p>In addition, we lamented the lack of a codebreaking book that was computer aware and covered the numerous software programs and websites available today for solving ciphertexts. We also wanted such a book to include the recent codebreaking research and fascinating new methods of solving ciphers. No book on the market came even close to our expectations. The only ones we could think of were the pre–computer age 1939 classic by Helen Fouché Gaines, <em>Cryptanalysis</em>, and bits and pieces of other books and journals. None of these really scratched the itch by pulling everything together.</p>
<p>By the time we arrived back in Maryland, we had decided we were going to change this by co-authoring such a book. The rest is history. The first edition was published in 2020, and here we are, years later, putting the finishing touches on the expanded edition of <em>Codebreaking: A Practical Guide</em>.</p>
<p>Writing a book was nothing new for either of us. Elonka, a game developer by trade, has written about cryptography in the past, notably in <em>The Mammoth Book of Secret Codes and Cryptograms</em> in 2006 and two articles in the 2009 bestseller <em>Secrets of the Lost Symbol</em>, about Dan Brown’s <em>Da Vinci Code</em> sequel. She has also created multiple web pages concerning ciphers and codebreaking that have received millions of page views on the internet. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxi" title="xxi"/>Klaus has authored some 25 books in German (over half of which are about encryption technology), along with 250 magazine articles, 30 research papers, and 1,600 posts on his <em>Cipherbrain</em> blog. All of that makes him the most prolific crypto author in the world.</p>
<p>Despite our experience, co-writing this book was far from a routine project. We both had busy day jobs and speaking schedules, which had us constantly traveling. Also, as there was an ocean between us, we had to remotely sync our schedules to communicate via Skype and Zoom calls across a time difference of five to nine hours, depending on which part of the world we were in. We did have two in-person meetings, though, to be honest, we did not really use them to work on our book; the time was filled with research in libraries, interviewing crypto people, and other field trips. We even made a second visit to the home of the Beale ciphers in Bedford, Virginia, and a pilgrimage to the George C. Marshall Library in Lexington, Virginia, to research the history of the United States’s most famous cryptanalytic couple, Elizebeth and William Friedman.</p>
<p>Still, working on our codebreaking book was a rewarding task. We put on paper what had occupied us for over two decades, and it felt gratifying to finally give these thoughts a home. The book you are holding draws from many sources, including other codebreaking books from the pre-computer era, articles in the academic journal <em>Cryptologia</em>, and Klaus’s hundreds of relevant blog posts, many of which had been commented upon by some of the best codebreakers in the world. In addition to describing solving methods, we include numerous success stories that show that, when it comes to cracking ciphers, devotion, imagination, and luck are sometimes just as helpful as expertise and years of experience.</p>
<p>As one of our few setbacks, we had to accept that there is much more interesting material about codebreaking than we could fit into a book of 500+ pages. With the first edition, we had no other choice than (with a great amount of screaming and gnashing of teeth) to narrow our scope, which meant that dozens of codebreaking methods, unsolved crypto mysteries, cipher challenges, and success stories we would have loved to include didn’t make it into the final manuscript. However, now that we have an expanded edition, we have put many of them back in!</p>
<p>And then, toward the end of our (first) book-writing project, the entire world took a bizarre turn when COVID-19 surfaced. It was the start of a crisis that affected both of our lives and, of course, the rest of the world. Elonka was in San Francisco when this occurred, and the initial “shelter in place” order and advice to avoid airports meant she was unable to return to her home in Maryland for months. She continued working on the book while perched in a guest room at the home of her Bay Area friends, Jon and Beth Leonard. Klaus spent the coronavirus time in his apartment in Gelsenkirchen, Germany.</p>
<p>Surviving the COVID crisis, we successfully turned in our manuscript, and the first edition of our book was published in the United Kingdom on December 10, 2020. But then, on December 11, we were contacted by our colleague Dave Oranchak, who told us that we were going to need to rework the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxii" title="xxii"/>book! As was later reported in the news, he and two others had just cracked a legendary unsolved code: the fifty-year-old Zodiac Z340. So, we knew almost immediately that our book needed a new edition.</p>
<p>This version includes, of course, all the latest details on the Z340 solve, plus more information about other codes that (as of this nanosecond) are unsolved. For example, we have expanded the sections on two different sculptures on either side of the equator: <em>Kryptos</em> in the Northern Hemisphere and the Australian <em>NKRYPT</em> in the Southern. Reaching back to the nineteenth century, we’ve added more about both the Furlong postcard and the Collinson newspaper ads. We’ve also provided updates on the recently exhumed Somerton Man; the message from the World War II carrier pigeon that was found in a chimney in 1982; the Dorabella Cipher of 1897; and the Chinese Gold Bars, from our conversation with Peter Bisno, Esq., in December 2020.</p>
<p>Other additions include a nomenclator message sent by Charles I of England that we found in the archives and more information about other ciphers and cipher solvers. Drawing from our article in the academic journal <em>Cryptologia</em>, “How We Set New World Records in Breaking Playfair Ciphertexts,” we’ve added more information about the hot cryptanalytic technique of hill climbing and how it is being used to solve older ciphers left and right. Also, we’ve fixed several errors that crept into the first edition. Thank you to all our eagle-eyed readers!</p>
<p>You’ll find an appendix with a Morse code table (we were astonished to learn we missed that in the 2020 edition!); a new section on the Voynich manuscript that shows the results of our comparing its traits with similar encrypted books from the last 600 years; many new references; an updated metapuzzle (with a fresh hint or two); and an expanded reading list of additional titles of use to codebreakers, including several new biographies of Elizebeth Friedman.</p>
<p>As before and always, we wish you the most fun in reading our book.</p>

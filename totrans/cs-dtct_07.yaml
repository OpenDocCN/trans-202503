    juices and sliding eels. A second barrel landed a moment later, sending out a
    fresh wave. The eels, Deepwater Longbacks by the look of them, measured around
    four feet from end to end and threatened to trip and tangle, not to mention disgust.
    A group of three thugs fell into a heap as they tried to escape the splash zone.

    hit the railing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He pulled Notation toward the railing at the ship’s edge, sliding through the
    puddles of pickling juices and piles of eels. A fourth barrel hit the deck and
    sent the thugs scurrying again. The deck was beginning to look like a grotesque
    bowl heaped with long, pale gray noodles.

- en: Alongside the ship bobbed a small, nondescript, but oddly familiar schooner
    loaded with more barrels. A teenage boy, dressed in wizard’s robes, was rolling
    a new barrel onto a contraption composed of planks.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Jump,” agreed Frank, eyeing the other ship. He didn’t recognize the boy but
    figured that he must be an enemy of the Vinettees. Nobody in their right mind
    would fling pickled eels at the Vinettees unless they were already at war. Then
    again, very few people in their right mind would chose eels as a weapon under
    any circumstance.

    She sailed through the air, clearing the gap easily, and landed on the schooner’s
    deck.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Frank pulled himself up onto the railing, muttered a handful of Boolean curse
    words, and hesitated again as he balanced on the wooden beam. Then, after counting
    to three a few times, he jumped. Frank missed the schooner by two feet and plunged
    into the freezing water. He surfaced in time to see another barrel soar overhead.
    He paused briefly to wonder if the boy was still flinging eels or whether he had
    moved onto something else—soft cheeses, perhaps.

    wringing out his cloak while he assessed their new situation. The teenager was
    continuing his barrage of the *Retry Loop*. Sailors hurried around the deck, pushing
    the smaller ship away from the *Retry Loop* with long wooden poles.

    pointing at the teenager. “It’s up to him how he wants to unload it.”

    month they stole one of my caches—17 bushels of carrots!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    business. A hundred bushels of carrots wouldn’t be close to worth it.

    goodness of my heart. It’s a paid contract. Simple as that. Socks made it worth
    my while.”

    In my business, you don’t press for real names.”

    Notation. Mavis gave her a skeptical look.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    heading out to sea. Dirty sails were hoisted into the air, blocking Socks’s barrel
    throwing. He took a last long look at the *Retry Loop*, smiled, and turned finally
    to Frank.
  prefs: []

    Frank shook it warily.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Thank you for saving us, *Socks*,” Notation said as she shook his hand too.
    She eyed him beadily, then, apparently unsatisfied with the subtlety of her approach,
    followed with, “What’s your real name, Socks?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Unfortunately, that is my real name,” replied Socks a little sadly. “My full
    name is Socks Repellent, Officer.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    for such a misfortune, she repeated, “Thank you for saving us.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    I’m glad it worked.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    we needed help?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    #2.”'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    obvious answer in the world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I think so,” said Socks, suddenly looking uncertain. “You’re investigating
    one of the police department thefts, right? I saw Captain Donovan visit Frank
    last night, so I assumed it had something to do with the one at headquarters.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    But I don’t think that was supposed to be secret. I guess—”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Why are the wizards concerned about thefts from police stations?” Frank cut
    in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “The king called them in. A few weeks ago, King Fredrick summoned some of the
    kingdom’s most senior and respected wizards to investigate a theft. I’m Gretchen’s
    apprentice, of course. It’s only my second year, but—”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Why did he call in senior wizards?” Frank interrupted again. Gretchen wasn’t
    a name he’d heard before. Evidently, the more powerful wizards had been occupied
    with more pressing tasks, and the king had worked his way down the list, but Frank
    didn’t want to embarrass the boy by questioning his mentor’s seniority.
  prefs: []

    should be their investigation.”

    find it,” explained Socks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You don’t know about the mask?” said Socks, now a little panicked. “Oh, dear.
    Maybe I shouldn’t have said anything.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “What mask?” growled Frank. He rubbed his temples and took a few deep breaths.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Mr. Repellent,” took up Notation in her official police voice, “we are on an
    important investigation. If you have information that would help in this case,
    it is your duty to provide it. Please tell us everything.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It took 10 minutes for Socks to finish his excessively detailed story concerning
    a monthlong crime spree in which a multitude of unrelated items were stolen from
    secure locations. The most disturbing revelation involved the theft of a dangerous
    magical artifact, an enchanted mask, from a military convoy. When pressed for
    details on what the mask did or why it needed an armed escort, Socks would only
    repeat that it was “extremely powerful.” The awe in his voice made Frank nervous.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You think this theft is related to the one at the police station?” asked Notation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Gretchen thinks so,” Socks answered. “In every case, the guards were completely
    unaware that a theft had occurred until the next day. She thinks the thief used
    a memory spell or a sleep charm.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I did not fall asleep,” Notation said with such force that even Frank leaned
    away.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Frank left him to flail about for words as he pondered the kid’s story. Something
    about it didn’t add up. “Why tail us?” he asked finally. “You’re on an investigation
    sanctioned by the king himself, right? You could have just walked up and introduced
    yourself.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “But?” asked Frank.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I wasn’t sure you were going to find anything interesting,” explained Socks.
    “Once I introduced myself, I would be obliged to come with you and help out, right?
    I wanted to keep my options open. What if I heard about a better, magical lead
    or something? Sorry,” the boy muttered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    them, doing whatever was needed to make a ship move. As far as Frank could tell,
    it seemed to primarily involve pulling on ropes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    “Our next step is to investigate them, starting with the Port of Mudwall. In fact,
    I should inform the captain of the ship. Of course, we’ll need to borrow her vessel
    for the investigation.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Frank laughed. “Good luck explaining that to Mavis.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No need,” said Socks hurriedly. “I already paid to contract the ship. You just
    need to tell Mavis where to sail.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Excellent,” said Notation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Which means you’re coming with us, doesn’t it?” asked Frank, without trying
    to conceal the irritation in his voice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Of course,” said Socks. “I paid for the ship. And I saved you. And I seem to
    know more about the case than anyone else here. And I’m an apprentice wizard.
    That could come in handy.” His desperation seemed to increase with every additional
    reason.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Mr. Repellent, we would be grateful for your assistance,” Notation assured
    him. “Wouldn’t we, Frank?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    didn’t trust. At this rate, he would have a boatful by nightfall.

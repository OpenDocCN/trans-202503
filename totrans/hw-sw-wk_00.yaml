- en: Science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke wrote that “any sufficiently advanced
    technology is indistinguishable from magic.” If we don’t know how something works,
    then it might as well be explained by supernatural forces. By that standard, we
    live in an age of magic.

    special effects in movies, and streaming video. We’re forgetting we used to live
    in a world in which the answer to a question wasn’t just a Google search away,
    or where finding a route for a car trip began with unfolding a cumbersome map.

- en: But few of us have any idea how all this software works. Unlike many innovations
    of the past, you can’t take software apart to see what it’s doing. Everything
    happens on a computer chip that looks the same whether the device is performing
    an amazing task or isn’t even turned on. Knowing how a program works seems to
    require spending years of study to become a programmer. So it’s no wonder that
    many of us assume that software is beyond our understanding, a collection of secrets
    known only to a technological elite. But that’s wrong.

    a casual fan of technology, a programmer in the making, or someone in between,
    this book is for you.

- en: This book covers the most commonly used processes in software and does so without
    a single line of programming code. No prior knowledge of how computers operate
    is required. To make this possible, I’ve simplified a few processes and clipped
    some details, but that doesn’t mean these are mere high-level overviews; you’ll
    be getting the real goods, with enough details that you’ll truly understand how
    these programs do what they do.

    so that only we can access it. When you lock your phone or password-protect a
    *.zip* file, you’re using encryption. We’ll see how different scrambling techniques
    are combined in modern encryption software.'

    our data and how we identify ourselves to remote systems. You’ll see how passwords
    are used in encryption and learn the surprising steps that must be taken to keep
    passwords safe from attackers.'

    purchase goods online or access our accounts. Locking data for transmission requires
    a different method of scrambling called public-key encryption. You’ll discover
    how a secure web session requires all the techniques covered in the first three
    chapters.'

    whole worlds out of mathematical descriptions. You’ll discover how software took
    over traditional cel animation and then learn the key concepts behind making a
    complete movie set with software.'

    for their visuals but also for how they are created in mere fractions of a second.
    We’ll explore a host of clever tricks games use to produce stunning images when
    they don’t have time for the techniques discussed in the previous chapter.'

    we can get more out of our storage and bandwidth limits. We’ll explore the best
    methods for shrinking data, and then see how they are combined to compress high-definition
    video for Blu-ray discs and web streams.'

    whether it’s a search for a file on our own computer or a search across the whole
    Web. We’ll explore how data is organized for quick searches, how search zeros
    in on requested data, and how web searches return the most useful results.'

    share data. Without concurrency, multiplayer video games wouldn’t be possible,
    and online bank systems could allow only one customer at a time. We’ll talk about
    the methods that enable different processors to access the same data without getting
    in each other’s way.'

    we get from mapping sites and in-car navigators. You’ll discover what a map looks
    like to software and the specialized search techniques that find the best routes.'

- en: I think it’s important to share this knowledge. We shouldn’t have to live in
    a world we don’t understand, and it’s becoming impossible to understand the modern
    world without also understanding software. Clarke’s message can be taken as a
    warning that those who understand technology can fool those who don’t. For example,
    a company may claim that the theft of its login data poses little danger to its
    customers. Could this be true, and how? After reading this book, you’ll know the
    answer to questions like these.

    how software works: because those secrets are *really cool*. I think the best
    magic tricks are even more magical once you learn how they are done. Read on and
    you’ll see what I mean.'

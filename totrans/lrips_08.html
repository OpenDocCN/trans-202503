Hugh Rustic’s shop was easy to find.
Its sign was even bigger and fancier than Tinker’s.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00023a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00023"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/061fig02.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>“Hello, Mister Rustic?” Laurie called as she stepped inside the shop.
“Mister Tinker back in Symbol owes me an algorithm, and he said I should talk to you about
it.”</p><p>Rustic was a tall, loud, messy-looking man with a big red beard. He didn’t look anything
like the elegant Eponymous or the neat and proper Tinker.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00024a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00024"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/062fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>He certainly didn’t look how Laurie thought a Composer should look! But Tinker had
recommended him, so Laurie handed him the IOU.</p><p>“I’m, um, trying to find the shortest path through all the towns. Can you help
me?”</p><p>“Wonderful! Interesting!” Rustic said. “Tinker sent you to the right place,
miss. Improbable we can do right away. Impossible, by Tuesday at the latest.”</p><p>“But if it’s impossible—” Laurie began.</p><p>“Only improbable,” corrected Rustic.</p><p>“If it’s <span class="emphasis"><em>improbable</em></span>, how do you do it?”</p><p>“By shifting your point of view,” said Rustic. “Instead of looking for an
answer that fits your problem, you imagine an <span class="emphasis"><em>answer</em></span> and look for a problem to
fit it.”</p><p>“But you can’t just change the problem, can you?”</p><p>“Why, of course you can! Worrying about the problem is a waste of time! What you really
want is an answer, right?”</p><p>“Maybe, but I don’t understand how,” Laurie said.</p><p>“How do you buy the best tomato?” he said.</p><p>“Well, I . . . what?”</p><p>“Let’s say you’re at the market. You want the best, most perfect tomato. But
to find the <span class="emphasis"><em>best</em></span> tomato, you’d have to compare them all, right?
You’d look at each and every one, turn it around, maybe squeeze it a bit. For every tomato in
the whole market.”</p><p>“No one does that!” said Laurie. “Well, old Mrs. Harris
<span class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> do that. But my mom says she’s a little batty. I just pick a good
one.”</p><p>“See? You already know how to do things the Hugh Rustic way. You don’t waste your
time looking for the <span class="emphasis"><em>best</em></span> tomato when there are plenty that are Good
Enough.”</p><p>“So instead of trying to find the <span class="emphasis"><em>shortest</em></span> path through all of the
towns in Userland,” Laurie said, “we look for one that’s short
<span class="emphasis"><em>enough</em></span>?”</p><p>“Why not?” asked Rustic. “Out of all the zippity-million paths, I bet there
are a whole lot that are pretty short. You need to find only <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> of them, and
that’s much easier.”</p><p>Rustic pulled out a large map and placed it on the counter.</p><p>“Here is where we are,” he said, pointing to Permute, “and this is where you
started, am I right? Let’s put some pencils here to stand in for Mount Upper Bound, and a
little spoon there for Lower Bound Valley.” The map also had markers for Bach and Recursion
Junction, as well as many other places Laurie hadn’t been to yet.</p><p>“Now for the fun part,” said Rustic. “Let’s ask the
ants.”</p><p>“Ask the <span class="emphasis"><em>ants</em></span>? What are you talking about? Ants can’t read
maps!” Laurie said. At the mention of insects, Xor was suddenly alert.</p><p>“Who says they can’t? Next you’ll try to tell me that turtles can’t
draw circles,” Rustic said.</p><p>“So you teach the ants to read maps?”</p><p>“Not exactly. Ants are good at finding their way home already. The idea is to get them
to work for us.” He opened a jar of honey and put a tiny daub of the sweet stuff on each
town.</p><p>A minute passed. Nothing happened. Then a little ant crawled onto the table. It smelled the
honey and zig-zagged its way onto the map. It nibbled from one bit of honey, then wandered around
until it walked into another one.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00025a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00025"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/065fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>“When an ant finds food, she leaves a little scent message for the others that come
after her,” Rustic said. “Ants follow the scent of food and also the scent of other
ants. Lots of ants can try lots of different paths at the same time. Eventually they’ll settle
on a quick route to all of the food and back to their nest.”</p><p>The first ant continued on to Bach. Another appeared and went directly to Recursion Junction
instead. Still others went all the way across to Probability Bay, Permute, Notation, and other
towns. Soon the map had dozens of ants going every which way, collecting bits of honey and leaving
scents for their sisters.</p><p>After a few minutes it was clear that some paths were more popular than others. The lines of
ants got wider and wider, until there was just one ant superhighway that marched all around the map
and back to the nest. Hugh Rustic copied it to a piece of paper before the honey disappeared.</p><p>“Ah, there you go!” he said, handing Laurie his sketch.</p><p>“Thank you, Mister Rustic! Is this really the shortest way?”</p><p>“It’s <span class="emphasis"><em>a</em></span> short way. That’s as much as I can
promise.”</p></div></body></html>

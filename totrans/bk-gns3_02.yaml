- en: Say good-bye to the world of hardware and say hello to GNS3! It’s a whole new
    way to learn networking. In this chapter, I’ll guide you through the process of
    installing a basic GNS3 system on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Ubuntu Linux.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A basic installation consists of the GNS3 application and a few helper applications.
    On Windows and OS X, all prerequisite applications come bundled in the GNS3 installer
    package, which is available from the GNS3 website (*[http://www.gns3.com/](http://www.gns3.com/)*).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When installing on Linux, you can download and install GNS3 through a platform-specific
    package manager or directly from source code. The principles used for installing
    from source code can be applied to just about any Unix-based system, and it is
    a great way to ensure that you have the latest software.

- en: The requirements for running GNS3 are largely determined by the operating system
    you’re installing on, the model and number of routers you want to use in your
    projects, and whether you integrate external programs like QEMU or VirtualBox
    into your designs. Most computers purchased in the last few years should be able
    to run this base installation without a hitch.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That said, if you decide to move beyond creating projects using only Cisco routers
    and incorporate other virtual environments into your GNS3 designs (such as Linux,
    BSD, ASA, IDS, or Juniper), you’ll want as much horsepower as you can get your
    hands on. The more memory and processing power you have, the better everything
    will run because programs like QEMU and VirtualBox require RAM to run their guest
    operating systems, and they compete with your native operating system for CPU
    time. You’ll also need additional disk space to store your guest operating systems.

    a more powerful system.

    lack of documentation for most of them. In this section, I’ll strip away the mystery

    chosen to cover Ubuntu because it’s one of the most commonly used distributions.

- en: There are two ways to install GNS3 on Linux. You can install a bundled package
    through your package manager or you can install from source code. Using a packaged
    install is quick and easy, but the downside is that you’re stuck with whatever
    version of GNS3 has been ported to your specific platform, which may not be the
    latest version. This is where a source install comes in handy. Installing from
    source requires only a few extra steps and provides you with the latest version
    of GNS3\. Even though I highly recommend installing from source code, we’ll cover
    both methods here.

    I’ll use Ubuntu Linux as a framework, but keep in mind that these instructions

    you’ll have a portable GNS3 installation that can be moved from one PC to another.

    of RAM if you want your guest OS and GNS3 to run well, especially if you create

    your project might take a slight performance hit depending on the underlying hardware.

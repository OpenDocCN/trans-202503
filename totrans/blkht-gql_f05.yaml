- en: Many people have contributed to the success of this book, both directly, through
    advice and guidance, and indirectly, by publishing GraphQL tools, educational
    resources, blog posts, and cutting-edge research. We would like to thank those
    with whom we’ve worked closely. Without their patience, support, sacrifices, and
    guidance, releasing this book would have been an impossible mission.

- en: Thank you to Limor-Petersil Farhi, Dolev’s wife and partner, who supported him
    throughout this journey. Without her unconditional support and encouragement,
    this whole process would have been much harder to complete. Writing a book has
    been on Dolev’s to-do list for a long time, and he feels beyond lucky to have
    such a partner in his life who enabled him to do so. Thank you for stepping up
    and taking care of everything else while he was hacking both GraphQL and Microsoft
    Word to get this book out the door.

    API for WordPress, who provided us with a tremendous amount of insightful information
    about the GraphQL ecosystem. Through his open source contributions, we learned
    a whole lot about the less-explored surfaces of GraphQL.

    guidance and excellent work in building free and open source GraphQL tools for
    the entire community’s benefit. You are not only great engineers, but also effectively

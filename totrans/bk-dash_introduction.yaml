    raw information and data are often meaningless without context. Data is a valuable
    asset only when properly analyzed, interpreted, and understood. As a result, new
    fields proliferate. Data scientist, data engineer, data analyst, business intelligence
    consultant, and machine learning engineer are all increasingly popular careers,
    and they all share a common role: interpreting data using visual tools such as
    graphs and dashboards.'

    with numbers, this book will give you the tools and education to harness the power

- en: The Plotly Dash framework makes it super easy for you to build your own dashboards.
    *Dashboards* are web apps that allow you and your users to dynamically explore
    data using interactive widgets that receive user input to explain output. For
    example, they might have sliders, text fields, buttons, and dropdown menus to
    allow the user to choose what data to show in the resultant charts and graphs,
    like the maps and bar charts you see in [Figure 1](#fig1). The interactivity of
    dashboard apps is what has made them increasingly popular in recent years.

    dashboard applications that can provide users with a real-time, data-driven overview
    of what’s happening in the world. Chances are you’ve already used browser-based
    dashboards in your own life: Google Analytics, Facebook Ad Manager, and Salesforce
    Dashboards are some examples of real-life dashboard applications. [Figure 1](#fig1)

    users in the United States and Asia were still sleeping while users in Europe
    were already busy searching the web. How seamlessly these insights arise when
    visualizing the data properly using a dashboard app! Creating these types of applications
    has been possible only for skilled coders and large organizations that were able
    to connect real-time data sources with dynamic websites to create the unique value
    proposition provided by dashboard apps.

    use Plotly Dash for the job. There are a lot of great alternative frameworks for
    creating dashboards, including Streamlit, Shiny, Jupyter, Tableau, Infogram, and

    Python, you’ll be able to get up and running very quickly. It also means it’s
    easy to integrate data and results from your existing Python work into a Dash
    app.

    able to prototype and iterate much more quickly, which can be very useful when
    developing apps to a deadline or in an agile environment where requirements are
    regularly changing.

    frontend and the Python backend. So you don’t need to take on overcomplicated

    you have a lot of programming experience, so we explain basics such as how to
    install Dash and related libraries, how to set up your programming environment,
    and how to use libraries like pandas. An entire course on Python is beyond the
    scope of this book, but [Chapter 1](chapter1.xhtml) will go over some of the Python

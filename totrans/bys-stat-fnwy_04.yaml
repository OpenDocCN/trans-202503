- en: 'In [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#ch02), you learned that probabilities are measured
    on a scale of 0 to 1, 0 being *false* (definitely not going to happen), and 1
    being *true* (definitely going to happen). The next important logical rule involves
    combining two probabilities with AND. We do this using the product rule, which
    simply states that to get the probability of two events occurring together, *P*(*A*)
    and *P*(*B*), we just multiply them together:'

  zh: 在[第2章](ch02.xhtml#ch02)中，你学到概率是按0到1的尺度来衡量的，0表示*假*（肯定不会发生），而1表示*真*（肯定会发生）。接下来的重要逻辑规则涉及将两个概率通过“与”运算结合起来。我们使用乘积法则，它简单地指出，要计算两个事件同时发生的概率
    *P*(*A*) 和 *P*(*B*)，只需要将它们相乘：
- en: '*P*(*A*,*B*) = *P*(*A*) × *P*(*B*)'
  id: totrans-118

  zh: '*P*(*A*,*B*) = *P*(*A*) × *P*(*B*)'
- en: 'The final rule involves combining probabilities with OR using the sum rule.
    The tricky part of the sum rule is that if we add non–mutually exclusive probabilities,
    we’ll end up overcounting for the case where they both occur, so we have to subtract
    the probability of both events occurring together. The sum rule uses the product
    rule to solve this (remember, for mutually exclusive events, *P*(*A*, *B*) = 0):'

  zh: 最后的规则涉及通过求和规则来合并概率。求和规则的难点在于，如果我们加上了非互斥的概率，就会对同时发生的情况进行重复计算，因此必须减去两者同时发生的概率。求和规则通过乘积规则来解决这个问题（记住，对于互斥事件，*P*(*A*,
    *B*) = 0）：

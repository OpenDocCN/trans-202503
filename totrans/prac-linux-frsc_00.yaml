    This book covers a variety of methods and techniques for finding and analyzing
    digital evidence found on modern Linux systems. Among digital forensic investigators,
    the phrase *Linux forensics* may have one of two meanings. In one case, it refers
    to using Linux as a digital forensics platform to perform acquisition or analysis
    of any target system under investigation (which could be Windows, Mac, Linux,
    or any other operating system). In this book, however, Linux forensics refers
    to analyzing or examining a suspect Linux system as the target of an investigation
    (independent of the platform or tools used).'

    comment: “We are starting to get more Linux images in our lab, but we don’t know
    exactly what to look for.” Such comments are coming both from forensic labs in
    the private sector (corporations) and the public sector (law enforcement). This
    book is intended to provide a resource that addresses this growing area of interest.
    It will help forensic investigators find and extract digital evidence found on
    Linux systems, reconstruct past activity, draw logical conclusions, and write
    comprehensive forensic evidence reports of their analysis.'

- en: This is a book on postmortem digital forensic analysis, which means the drive
    images containing digital evidence have already been secured in a forensically
    sound manner (by using write blockers, for example) and are ready for examination.
    The examination process includes identifying various aspects of the drive contents,
    searching for specific content, extracting evidence traces, interpreting information,
    reconstructing past events, and gaining a full understanding of the contents of
    the drive. This analysis activity will allow investigators to draw conclusions
    and create forensic reports about a particular case or incident.

    Linux* class, students often ask what *Modern* means in this context. I didn’t
    want my course to be based on converted Unix material, but rather wanted to focus
    on aspects unique to Linux. Linux has Unix foundations, but has also drifted away
    from Unix in significant ways. The most fundamental (and controversial) example
    of this is systemd, which is used in most Linux distributions today and is covered
    extensively in this book. Other topics included under my modern Linux definition
    include: UEFI booting, new kernel features like cgroups and namespaces, D-Bus
    communication, Wayland and the standards at *[freedesktop.org](http://freedesktop.org)*,
    newer filesystems like btrfs, new encryption protocols like WireGuard, rolling-release
    models, universal software packaging, and other new topics associated with the
    latest Linux distributions.'

  zh: 这本书的广泛范围是Linux的“现代”方面。在我的*现代Linux*课程中，学生们经常问“现代”在这个语境中是什么意思。我不希望我的课程基于转换过来的Unix材料，而是想专注于Linux独有的方面。Linux有Unix的基础，但在许多方面也与Unix有了显著的区别。最根本的（也是最具争议的）例子就是systemd，它在今天大多数Linux发行版中都有使用，并且在本书中有详细介绍。根据我对现代Linux的定义，其他涵盖的主题包括：UEFI启动、像cgroups和namespaces这样的新内核特性、D-Bus通信、Wayland以及*([freedesktop.org](http://freedesktop.org))*的标准、像btrfs这样的新文件系统、像WireGuard这样的新加密协议、滚动发布模型、通用软件打包，以及与最新Linux发行版相关的其他新话题。
- en: Some topics are too large, too diverse, or too obscure for inclusion in this
    book. In such cases, I’ll describe the topic at a high level and provide pointers
    on where to find more information. One example is the analysis of Linux backups.
    So many different backup solutions exist that writing about all of them could
    easily take up a significant portion of the book. Another example is Android forensics.
    Even though Android is based on Linux, it is such a large topic that it could
    easily fill a book on its own (and indeed many Android forensics books are on
    the market today). There are many highly customized Linux distributions designed
    for embedded systems and specialized hardware (robotics, automotive, medical,
    and so on). These custom and specialty systems may be mentioned here, but detailed
    coverage is outside the book’s scope.

    Android 取证。尽管 Android 基于 Linux，但它是一个庞大的话题，完全可以单独成书（事实上，现在市面上有许多 Android 取证的书籍）。还有很多专为嵌入式系统和特定硬件（机器人、汽车、医疗等）设计的高度定制化

    and independent of regional jurisdictions because more and more criminal investigations
    span country borders and involve multiple jurisdictions. The book also provides
    an introduction to modern Linux systems, including the history, culture, and all

    that writing about forensic evidence integrity and then manipulating the very
    evidence provided in the book (by forward-dating timestamps) isn’t appropriate.
    In addition, changing visible dates in the examples may cause dates in encoded
    data to be inconsistent or cause forensic timelines to be false. The output of
    a particular tool might also be different when performed at a later point in time.
    I wanted to avoid these risks of inconsistency. All the command output you see
    in this book reflects the actual output from testing and research, including the

- en: Forensic analysis involves locating traces of evidence and reconstructing past
    activity. To achieve this goal, we must understand where interesting data (potential
    evidence) is flowing and being stored. The diagrams used in this book illustrate
    the flow of data between programs, daemons, hosts, or other data processing systems
    (over a network). The files and directories that are interesting from a forensic
    evidence perspective are also shown in diagrams.

    used throughout the book. The boxes indicate the source or destination of interesting
    data (files, programs, and other machines). The lines indicate an associated flow
    of data (read/received or written/sent).'

    A remote host and a daemon are exchanging data (a daemon is a program running
    in the background). There are configuration files, logfiles, temporary files,
    and cached data.

    than just the association. In some diagrams, I may have a box representing a simplified
    view consisting of several programs (creating an abstraction when other details
    are not useful to know).

    components interesting from a digital forensics perspective within the context
    of the given section. Using diagrams like this helps visualize the location of
    potential forensic evidence on the Linux system.

    forensic investigators and security incident response people, I hope you learn
    a lot about how to analyze Linux systems. For the Linux engineers and enthusiasts,
    I hope this helps you leverage digital forensic investigations to perform troubleshooting
    and debugging.

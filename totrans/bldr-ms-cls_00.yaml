    in 3D, using two pieces of software: Blender, for 3D design and animation, and
    GIMP, for 2D image editing. In each chapter I take you through a part of the process
    of creating three complete 3D scenes. You’ll learn how to block out and create
    models, sculpt and detail them, texture and create materials, use lighting, and
    render finished images. In the course of the book, I discuss the wide array of
    tools that Blender and GIMP offer and how to use them in real projects.'

    using three of my own projects to provide the narrative and examples of the tasks
    required. By the end of this book, you should be able to create your own projects
    from scratch using the principles demonstrated in the three example projects.

- en: '**[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Introduction to Blender") and [Chapter 2](ch02.html
    "Chapter 2. Introduction to GIMP")** offer an introduction to Blender and GIMP.
    You learn what they are, where you can get them, and what you can do with them.
    I also introduce you to their user interfaces and the basics of working with them.
    [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Introduction to Blender") focuses on Blender.
    We look at adding and manipulating objects, saving and loading, and best practices
    when working on a project. In [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Introduction to
    GIMP") we examine creating images in GIMP using its various brushes and filters,
    as well as how to work with layers and selections.'

    material, creating concept art and using these materials in Blender to make it
    easier to bring your ideas to life in 3D. I discuss using orthographic references,
    creating reference sheets, and importing reference images into Blender’s 3D Viewport
    to use while modeling.'

    "Chapter 5. Modeling the Details")** we move on to blocking in the most important
    aspects of a scene with simple geometry and then fleshing out these basic forms
    with more detailed models. We look in-depth at Blender’s 3D modeling tools and
    how to create models with simple, efficient geometry.

- en: '**[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Sculpting")** covers Blender’s sculpting
    tools and how to combine them with Blender’s Multiresolution modifier to produce
    a model that can be sculpted like clay—perfect for creating detailed, organic
    models.'

    high-resolution, sculpted geometry from [Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Sculpting")
    to create simpler geometry. We look at a few of the different methods Blender
    offers for retopology and how they can be applied to turn our sculpted meshes
    into final models.'

- en: '**[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Hair and Particle Systems")** covers creating
    strand particle systems with Blender’s particle tools. These can be used to generate
    hair and fur, and Blender’s particle mode brushes allow you to comb and cut that
    hair or fur into many shapes and styles. We look at the various settings for particle
    systems and how to use Blender’s child particles to generate vast numbers of particles
    from relatively few parents in order to create complex, thick hair and fur with
    minimum input.'

    the process of automatically generating textures based on the geometry of a mesh,
    while **[Chapter 11](ch11.html "Chapter 11. Texture Painting")** covers texture
    painting, which combines the baked textures from [Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Texture
    Baking") with hand-painted details and photographs using Blender’s texture painting
    tools and GIMP.'

    at the Blender Internal renderer and the Cycles render engine, and how each impacts
    the way we set up our lights and materials. In [Chapter 12](ch12.html "Chapter 12. Materials")
    we learn how to use the textures created in [Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Texture
    Baking") and [Chapter 11](ch11.html "Chapter 11. Texture Painting") to create
    materials that give realistic results when rendered. [Chapter 13](ch13.html "Chapter 13. Lighting")
    covers creating lights and how to set them up for both the Blender Internal and
    Cycles engines to get attractive lighting and shadows that render quickly.'

- en: In **[Chapter 14](ch14.html "Chapter 14. Rendering and Compositing")** we bring
    together all of the components created in previous chapters, including models,
    lights, materials, and textures, to render our final images. We discuss the most
    important render settings for the Blender Internal and Cycles engines, along with
    how to get the best results quickly. We also examine Blender’s node-based compositor
    and how to use it to further post-process your final renders. Finally, we use
    GIMP for some extra touch-ups and for painting backgrounds for our images.

    at the projects covered, and think about what could be done to take things further.
    I cover adding a few embellishments to the projects and look at them from some
    different perspectives, before examining ways to take our still images and make
    them move with Blender’s rigging and animation tools.

- en: Blender is an extremely powerful 3D design and animation package. It has tools
    for modeling, texturing, creating materials, and particle systems, as well as
    tools for rigging and animation, compositing, and scripting; a full-featured game
    engine; a non-linear video editor; and some advanced fluid, cloth, and rigid body-simulation
    tools. This book attempts to deal only with the aspects of Blender that are needed
    to create, texture, and render models as still images. It doesn’t cover Blender’s
    rigging and animation tools, simulation tools, or the game engine. There are a
    wealth of other resources out there on such topics. If you’re interested in finding
    them, try *[http://www.blender.org/education-help/](http://www.blender.org/education-help/)*.

    running a recent version of Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux. In particular,
    when it comes to the sculpting portions of the book, some extra RAM (8GB is good)
    and a reasonably fast graphics card will prove useful. A pressure sensitive pen
    tablet (for example a Wacom Bamboo or Intuos) will be really helpful when you
    reach the texturing and sculpting sections of the book, but it isn’t an absolute
    necessity.

    to center the discussion on three projects. Each was chosen to provide different
    challenges and thus provide you with broad, practical knowledge of the tools and
    options in Blender and GIMP.

- en: The Bat Creature project focuses on organic modeling to create a humanoid, if
    monstrous, creature ([Figure 1](pr05.html#bat_creature-id00001 "Figure 1. The
    Bat Creature")). For this project we first create a simple base mesh and then
    sculpt the more complex, organic forms of the body with Blender’s sculpt tools.
    We complement this by creating fur with Blender’s particle systems. We move on
    to unwrapping and texturing our creature and then create realistic materials for
    the skin and fur, which feature subsurface scattering and realistic hair. We render
    this project with the Blender Internal engine in order to use its highly customizable
    materials and fast, efficient rendering of hair and fur. Finally we create some
    dramatic lighting in [Chapter 13](ch13.html "Chapter 13. Lighting"), where you
    learn how to get the best results from Blender’s lights and how to achieve realistic
    shadows when working with fur.

- en: In contrast to the organic forms of the Bat Creature project, the Spider Bot
    project will show you how to create a mechanical-looking, hard-surface model of
    a robotic spider ([Figure 2](pr05.html#spider_bot-id00002 "Figure 2. The Spider
    Bot")). This task requires a different approach at each stage of the project when
    compared with the Bat Creature. We begin by blocking in basic forms with simple
    geometry, but we use duplication to create the repeated parts of the model, such
    as the legs. When sculpting we use Blender’s hard-surface brushes to arrive at
    a smoother, less organic final result. Then we use Blender’s retopology tools
    to refine the model into something smooth and sleek. Finally, we render this project
    with the Cycles render engine because it offers realistic rendering of shiny materials
    and complex lighting.

    a ruined temple deep in the jungle ([Figure 3](pr05.html#jungle_temple-id00003
    "Figure 3. The Jungle Temple")). We look at blocking in a scene and keeping its
    composition tailored to the camera. We use duplication, particle systems, and
    Blender add-ons to create varied vegetation. When texturing, we focus on creating
    multiple seamless textures using GIMP, which can be tiled and repeated across
    multiple objects to allow a wide variety of materials to be created using only
    a few unique textures. We render this scene with the Cycles engine (which allows
    for the quick creation of realistic lighting) in [Chapter 14](ch14.html "Chapter 14. Rendering
    and Compositing"), and then use Blender’s compositor to add some post-processing.
    Finally, we use GIMP to paint a background for the scene.'

- en: While the projects form the main narrative of this book, I don’t cover every
    step of creating them. Instead, I focus on the most important or difficult aspects
    of creating each project at each stage of its development and leave the rest as
    an exercise for you should you wish to produce a similar result. I hope that this
    approach will show you how to go about creating all kinds of 3D images with Blender
    and the thought processes and challenges involved. To help with this goal, most
    of the chapters in this book also feature supplementary information and tips that
    offer more general guidance that you should find useful in a wide range of projects.

    book, including separate *.blend* files for each project (corresponding to each
    chapter in the book) and each project in its final state at the end of each chapter
    (where relevant). These resources should allow you to look in-depth at the workings
    of each project and to examine how each one takes shape. Creating 3D art is a
    complex process, and the end product is often a result of some amount of experimentation.
    These project files are not a literal snapshot of the projects as they progressed;
    instead, they are an idealized, tidied-up version of what each project would look
    like at a given stage.

    Now we can start getting acquainted with Blender and GIMP, before diving into
    the projects. If you’re already comfortable with the basics of Blender and GIMP,
    you can skip to [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Preparation"). Otherwise, the
    next two chapters should provide a basic introduction to the workings of the software

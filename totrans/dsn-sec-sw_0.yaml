    concepts essential to the discipline of software security and learn how to practice
    the art of secure software design and implementation. Several of the topics covered
    here I was fortunate to have innovated myself. Others, I witnessed develop and
    take root. Based on my own industry experience, this book is packed with actionable
    ideas you can start using right away to make the software you work on more secure.

- en: I have had the unique opportunity of working on the front lines of software
    security over the course of my career, and now I would like to share my learnings
    as broadly as possible. Over 20 years ago, I was part of the team at Microsoft
    that first applied threat modeling at scale across a large software company. Years
    later, at Google, I participated in an evolution of the same fundamental practice,
    and experienced a whole new way of approaching the challenge. Part II of this
    book is informed by my having performed well over a hundred design reviews. Looking
    back on how far we have come provides me with a great perspective with which to
    explain it all anew.

- en: Designing, building, and operating software systems is an inherently risky undertaking.
    Every choice, every step of the way, nudges the risk of introducing a security
    vulnerability either up or down. This book covers what I know best, learned from
    personal experience. I convey the security mindset from first principles and show
    how to bake in security throughout the development process. Along the way I provide
    examples of design and code, largely independent of specific technologies so as
    to be as broadly applicable as possible. The text is peppered with numerous stories,
    analogies, and examples to add spice and communicate abstract ideas as effectively
    as possible.

    no trouble following the conceptual material so long as they understand the basics

    being responsible with the security knowledge this book presents. In order to
    explain how to make software safe, I have had to describe how various vulnerabilities

- en: Never play around by investigating security on production systems. When you
    read about cross-site scripting (XSS), for instance, you may be tempted to try
    browsing your favorite website with tricky URLs to see what happens. Please don’t.
    Even when done with the best of intentions, these explorations may look like real
    attacks to site administrators. It’s important to respect the possibility that
    others will interpret your actions as a threat—and, of course, you may be skirting
    the law in some countries. Use your common sense, including considering how your
    actions might be interpreted and the possibility of mistakes and unintended consequences,
    and err on the side of refraining. Instead, if you’d like to experiment with XSS,
    put up your own web server using fake data; you can then play around with this
    to your heart’s content.

  zh: 切勿在生产系统上随便进行安全测试。例如，当你阅读跨站脚本攻击（XSS）时，你可能会想尝试使用一些复杂的URL来浏览你最喜欢的网站，看看会发生什么。请不要这样做。即使出于最好的意图，这些实验也可能被网站管理员误认为是真正的攻击。尊重他人可能会将你的行为解读为威胁是非常重要的——当然，在某些国家，你可能还会违反法律。请运用你的常识，考虑你的行为可能会被如何解读，以及可能发生的错误和意外后果，并且要倾向于避免。相反，如果你想进行XSS实验，可以搭建自己的Web服务器并使用虚拟数据，然后尽情地进行实验。

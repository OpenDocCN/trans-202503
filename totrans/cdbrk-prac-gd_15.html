<p class="BodyFirst"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_304" title="304"/>The techniques we have described in this book so far comprise many of the encryption algorithms used before cipher machines and computers were invented. If you encounter a cryptogram created prior to 1900, chances are very high that the encryption method used is covered in this book. The same is true if you are dealing with an encrypted letter, postcard, or diary, no matter when it was written. Many encrypted documents from the twentieth century are encrypted using one of the systems mentioned in this book, as well—especially those that have no military or intelligence connection.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are many encryption methods we have not covered in detail in this book so far. In the following sections, we will briefly introduce a few of these.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-1" id="c15-noteref-1">1</a></sup></p>

<p class="BodyFirst">As mentioned in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 2"><a href="c02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a></span>, cipher disks or slides can be used to apply simple substitution ciphers or polyalphabetic ciphers. Over the course of crypto history, people have developed many types of cipher disks and slides, along with many other tools. For instance, there are cipher disks with more than one letter ring, cipher cylinders, and strip ciphers (see <a href="#figure15-1" id="figureanchor15-1">Figure 15-1</a>), just to name a few. While most of these tools implement a substitution cipher, the so-called <em>scytale</em> (pronounced “ski-ta-li”), which is a strip wound around a stick, can be used to realize a simple transposition.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-2" id="c15-noteref-2">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="h1-502727c15-0002"><a class="XrefDestination" id="Voiceencryption"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c15-004"/>Voice encryption</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Telephony came into wide use in the late nineteenth century, followed by voice radio a few decades later. Unwanted parties can eavesdrop on communications in both technologies. Radio communication is especially threatened, as a listener needs only an antenna and a radio device to do so, which is why <em>voice encryption</em>—also known as “ciphony”—inevitably became an important issue. Especially in the military, which adopted telephony and voice radio early, there was a demand for secure and convenient voice encryption devices.</p>
<p>Voice encryption requires completely different, and far more sophisticated, technology than text encryption. When engineers started to work on voice encryption systems in the early twentieth century, they faced a number of severe challenges. Voice transmission was analog at that time, and even today, it is difficult to encrypt analog signals in a secure way. It therefore comes as no surprise that virtually all voice encryption machines of the first generation used algorithms that could be broken without much effort.</p>
<p>During World War II, none of the war’s leading nations ever managed to design a voice encryption device that was secure and could also be built at a reasonable price. The most famous voice encryption machine of the war was the SIGSALY, an apparatus constructed by the Americans. It was extremely complex and filled a whole room. The SIGSALY encrypted digitized voice data with a one-time pad scheme, the keys of which were provided on vinyl records. The SIGSALY was probably the only secure means of voice encryption in World War II. However, the technology was expensive, which resulted in only a few copies being built. These devices were used only at the highest levels of the military.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-5" id="c15-noteref-5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Early in the Cold War, voice communication increasingly replaced Morse code radio transmissions. Concurrently, voice encryption technology became more important and made considerable progress. The devices became smaller, easier to operate, and less expensive, while new digitization methods, combined with new ciphers, provided a higher level of security. Dozens, if not hundreds, of encrypting telephones and radio devices were developed during this period, mainly for military and diplomatic uses. However, little is known about the encryption methods these Cold War devices used, as most of this information is still classified.</p>
<p>With the advent of the computer, it became possible to treat digitized voice as binary code, represented by sequences of zeros and ones, and to encrypt these with the same algorithms that were used to encrypt text and images. When digital cell phones came into popular use in the 1990s, many were already equipped with encryption modules. Today, all mobile phone <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_306" title="306"/>standards, including GSM, UMTS, and LTE, have encryption included—though only the wireless connection between the phone and the base station is protected by default.</p>
<p>Encrypting voice communication from one speaker to the other speaker (called <em>end-to-end encryption</em>) remains the domain of the military and diplomacy. The devices used for this purpose are usually expensive and rely on encryption algorithms that are not publicly known. Among ordinary users, end-to-end voice encryption is still rarely used, although some smartphone apps supporting encrypted communication are gradually gaining popularity.</p>
<p>As far as we know, there is no comprehensive book about the history of voice encryption on the market—though such a work could be highly interesting. However, a marvelous 2011 book, <em>How to Wreck a Nice Beach</em> by Dave Tompkins, covers the history of voice digitalization. It contains a lot of fascinating information about voice encryption, including the SIGSALY.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-6" id="c15-noteref-6">6</a></sup> In addition, <em>How to Wreck a Nice Beach</em> covers the use of voice digitizers (commonly known as vocoders) in music and other areas.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-7" id="c15-noteref-7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>As voice encryption is completely different from the text encryption methods this book focuses on, breaking voice encryption requires techniques distinct from the codebreaking methods we have introduced. In the early days of voice encryption, cryptanalysis mainly consisted of unscrambling analog signals, which was often not very difficult. With the advent of voice digitization early in the Cold War, the job for the codebreakers became increasingly challenging. Today, voice encryption cryptanalysis is no longer its own topic, since the algorithms used for this purpose are not very different from other computer-based encryption methods.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502727c15-0003"><a class="XrefDestination" id="Codetalking"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c15-005"/>Code talking</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Rather than using a machine for voice encryption, a human can do the job by translating the message into a little-known language. This method is referred to as <em>code talking</em>. Most readers will probably know that the United States successfully applied this technique using Navajo (Diné) code talkers in World War II.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-8" id="c15-noteref-8">8</a></sup> The 2002 Hollywood movie <em>Windtalkers</em>, starring Nicolas Cage, is about this practice.</p>
<p>However, the Navajo code talkers were not the only ones, or even the first, to use this technique. In World War I, the US Army engaged Cherokee, Choctaw, and other Native American people as code talkers, even though voice radio technology was not yet widespread. The British also employed Cherokees, and Canada used Native American code talkers as well.</p>
<p>These efforts only grew in scale. Three decades later, during World War II, telephone and voice radio played a more important role. Code talking was practiced on a larger scale and in a more systematic way. In several projects, the US armed forces recruited code talkers from over thirty Native American tribes. Most famously, the Navajos worked in the Pacific Theater and had an elaborate code with several hundred terms. The second-largest group was the Comanche code talkers, who joined the war effort in Europe.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-9" id="c15-noteref-9">9</a></sup></p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_307" title="307"/>The work of code talkers in World War II did not just consist of translating messages into their native language. They also applied a code based on their language, which usually included a spelling alphabet that enabled the code talkers to transmit names, geographical expressions, and other words they could not translate. In addition, code words for military terms that did not exist in the code talkers’ language were introduced. In many cases, <code>TURTLE</code> stood for <code class="bold">TANK</code>, while bird names denoted different kinds of airplanes. Before being sent into service, each code talker was trained in the code and became familiar with the radio technology he would use.</p>
<p>The US code talkers of World War II were quite successful. None of the language codes applied are known to have been broken, and the code talking itself proved quite efficient. Encrypting, transmitting, and decrypting a voice message via code talkers was considerably faster and less error-prone than sending it via encrypted Morse code.</p>
<p>After the war, code talking fell out of use. It had become less secure because of the ease of recording voice messages along with the development by linguists of better methods of analyzing spoken language. Also, during the Cold War, novel types of efficient voice encryption technology emerged that were more secure and easier to use.</p>
<p>Today, specialists could probably break virtually every kind of code talking with the help of linguistic computer programs. Breaking such a message, of course, requires completely different methods than the ones described in this book. It is more a matter of linguistics than of cryptography, and the best strategies for it are documented in wartime code books. These are currently available on the web.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-10" id="c15-noteref-10">10</a></sup></p>

<p class="BodyFirst">The message on the postcard depicted in <a href="#figure15-2" id="figureanchor15-2">Figure 15-2</a>, which was sent around 1910, is written in a so-called shorthand.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-11" id="c15-noteref-11">11</a></sup> <em>Shorthand</em> is a writing method that increases the speed and brevity of writing, typically allowing someone trained in the technique to record spoken language in real time. Some people also used shorthand for low-level encryption (e.g., for postcards).</p>

</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_308" title="308"/>The craft of writing in shorthand is referred to as <em>stenography</em>—not to be confused with steganography, a technique we will explain in a later section. Stenography was in wide use before recording and dictation machines were invented. Secretaries, journalists, policemen, and many others were trained in shorthand writing and used this technique in their professions.</p>
<p>Over centuries, many shorthand scripts were developed. Most of these were created (and therefore optimized) for a certain language, so different shorthand systems became popular in different countries. In the English-speaking world, one usually encounters Pitman shorthand,  which is most popular in the UK and was developed by Sir Isaac Pitman in the 1830s; or Gregg shorthand, which is most popular in the United States and was developed by John Robert Gregg in the 1880s.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-12" id="c15-noteref-12">12</a></sup> Many others never became popular.</p>
<p>Virtually everybody interested in historical codebreaking occasionally encounters shorthand texts. Professional codebreakers of the pre-computer era had to deal with this stenography, too, because their customers usually couldn’t tell the difference between shorthand and an encryption method—or didn’t care.</p>
<p>It is usually not very difficult to detect a shorthand message, even if one doesn’t know much about stenography. Most shorthand scripts look similar; this excerpt from Charles Dickens’s <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, written in the Gregg system (see <a href="#figure15-3" id="figureanchor15-3">Figure 15-3</a>), is a typical example.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-13" id="c15-noteref-13">13</a></sup></p>

<figcaption><p><a href="#figureanchor15-3" id="figure15-3">Figure 15-3</a>: Two pages from Charles Dickens’s 1843 <em>A Christmas Carol</em> in Gregg shorthand</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Almost all shorthand scripts are based on simple symbols and especially short line characters. The reason for this is that these simple symbols can be assembled into words and sentences in a fluid way. If you encounter a script whose symbols are more complex, it probably isn’t a shorthand.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_309" title="309"/>Some glyphs represent letters; others stand for common letter combinations, words, or phrases. Here are a few common words in Gregg shorthand:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="76" src="image_fi/502727c15/g15002.png" width="515"/></figure>
<p>An experienced user might also combine words rather than writing them separately.</p>
<p>The postcard shown at the beginning of this section is encoded in Pitman shorthand. The message reads as follows:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>I was very disappointed and</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>annoyed to find on my arrival at the</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>station at 5.5, that the train which I thought</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>always left at 5.15</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>had left very much earlier</code></p>
<p>Decoding a shorthand message is usually not considered an act of codebreaking. In most cases, it is sufficient to identify the shorthand method used and to ask somebody who knows it to reveal the meaning of the symbols (or use a description of the shorthand to decode it yourself). There are also now web utilities that accept a plaintext and convert it into Gregg or Pitman shorthand. Only on rare occasions, if one is dealing with an especially exotic shorthand, is cryptanalysis necessary. In such a case, a shorthand message should be treated like a nomenclator, as it will probably include both a cipher system for individual letters and symbols for entire words.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">The seventeenth-century drawing depicted in <a href="#figure15-4" id="figureanchor15-4">Figure 15-4</a> (and provided to us by Gerhard Strasser) shows an apple tree.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-14" id="c15-noteref-14">14</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-15" id="c15-noteref-15">15</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-16" id="c15-noteref-16">16</a></sup> Nothing appears suspicious about this picture at first glance. However, using the marks along the lower edge of the picture (which we have added to the original), we can divide the drawing into seventeen columns, each of which contains one apple. The uppermost apple is in the <code>I</code> column, the second in the <code>N</code> column, the third in the <code>D</code> column, and so on. If we read the entire drawing from top to bottom, the apples spell out the following Latin sentence: <code class="bold">INDE HIC LONGAT IBI SINT TEMPORA PROSPERA FIAT</code> (<code class="bold">MAY YOU LIVE A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE HERE</code>).</p>
<p>The message hidden in this unassuming drawing is an example of <em>steganography</em>, which is the practice of concealing messages in pictures, texts, and other objects. It is sometimes referred to as the sister of cryptography. While cryptography disguises information, steganography conceals its existence. The term is taken from the root words <em>steganos</em>, meaning “covered” or “roof,” and <em>graphein</em>, meaning “writing.”</p>

<p>Steganography has a history spanning thousands of years. The Greek historian Herodotus, for example, described the steganography technique of tattooing a message on a slave’s head. Other stories included writing on a wooden tablet that was then covered with wax or hiding a message in the pattern of a woman’s jewelry. Many other examples of steganography exist. The following list names just a small number of steganography techniques. If you want to know more about steganography and can read German, we also recommend Klaus’s 2017 book <em>Versteckte Botschaften</em>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-17" id="c15-noteref-17">17</a></sup></p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The ancient Greeks knew about what is today called <em>sympathetic ink</em>, a colorless fluid used to write invisible messages on paper. If the paper is heated (or treated in some other way), the writing becomes visible. This technique has been used by countless schoolchildren, who often hide secret messages by writing them in lemon juice, but hundreds of other fluids can be used as sympathetic inks. For instance, fruit juice, sugar water, urine, and many other organic fluids are well suited, as all become visible when heated. More sophisticated sympathetic inks require treatment with certain chemicals in order to become visible. For centuries, the use of sympathetic inks was the most practical way for spies to communicate with their case officers, and during the Cold War, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_311" title="311"/>chemists developed high-tech sympathetic inks that were extremely difficult for mail censors to detect. If you want to know more about sympathetic inks, read the 2014 book <em>Prisoners, Lovers, and Spies</em> by Kristie Macrakis.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-18" id="c15-noteref-18">18</a></sup></li>
<li>There are numerous ways to hide a message in a text. For instance, a text can be written such that the starting letters of each line spell out a message (a technique known as <em>acrostic writing</em>). Other methods include marking certain letters or writing a text in such a way that, say, every tenth letter spells out a secret message. Techniques of this kind have been used by, among others, prisoners, soldiers, and hostages in order to beat censorship. Other popular techniques include selecting certain letters or words from a text with a stencil (a so-called <em>Cardan grille</em>). A well-known example of this is the “hourglass cipher” used by British general Henry Clinton in 1777, during the American Revolutionary War (see <a href="#figure15-5" id="figureanchor15-5">Figure 15-5</a>).<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-19" id="c15-noteref-19">19</a></sup></li>

<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_312" title="312"/>One of the most prominent users of steganography in the twentieth century was a young American naval officer who later became president: John F. Kennedy.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-20" id="c15-noteref-20">20</a></sup> As we previously discussed in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 12"><a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a></span>, after Kennedy and his crew escaped the sinking of the torpedo boat <em>PT-109</em>,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-21" id="c15-noteref-21">21</a></sup> Australian coastwatcher Sublieutenant Reginald Evans dispatched one of his five teams of Solomon Islanders to find them. After a few days’ search, one of the teams found Kennedy and his men. Because the rescuers, Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana, did not speak English, Gasa communicated that Kennedy should carve an English message into a coconut with his pocketknife. That way, they could carry it in something that would not raise suspicion from the Japanese. The text read: <code class="bold">NAURO ISL COMMANDER . . . NATIVE KNOWS POS’IT . . . HE CAN PILOT . . . 11 ALIVE NEED SMALL BOAT . . . KENNEDY</code>. The hidden message reached Evans, who then coordinated a way to bring the stranded men through Japanese lines and back to an Allied base. Later, John F. Kennedy used the coconut shell as a paperweight in the Oval Office (see <a href="#figure15-6" id="figureanchor15-6">Figure 15-6</a>).</li>

<p class="BodyFirst">Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, DC, is the most famous cemetery in the United States. This national shrine has over 400,000 graves and a history that goes back to the 1800s. Primarily a military cemetery, it holds the graves of many notable people, two of whom are the famous cryptologists William and Elizebeth Friedman. Elizebeth Smith Friedman (1892–1980), one of the great cryptanalysts in American history, worked for the US Navy, the Coast Guard, and numerous related agencies. While working for the Coast Guard during the Prohibition era in the 1920s, she solved many rumrunner encryption systems.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-22" id="c15-noteref-22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Elizebeth’s husband William (1891–1969), whom she taught about codes during their courtship at Riverbank Laboratories, transitioned from his original career as a geneticist to become the most famous cryptologist in American history. During his long career in the US Army, he broke thousands of ciphers, led many renowned codebreaking teams, and wrote several groundbreaking works on cryptography, even coining the terms “cryptanalysis” and “index of coincidence.”</p>
<p>The Friedmans not only had a professional interest in cryptography, but they also enjoyed crypto puzzles and mysteries. It therefore comes as no surprise that on their tombstone in Arlington National Cemetery, a steganographic message is hidden (see <a href="#figure15-7" id="figureanchor15-7">Figure 15-7</a>). The tombstone was commissioned by Elizebeth after her husband died in 1969. The existence of this message was unknown until Elonka discovered it in 2017.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-23" id="c15-noteref-23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>When Elonka moved to Washington, DC, in 2017, one of her first explorations of the area was a visit to Arlington National Cemetery to see the Friedmans’ grave, as Elonka was such a fan of their work. She was entirely expecting to find some kind of hidden message on their tombstone and was surprised when it looked quite ordinary. Still, she took many pictures, and later that evening, she posted a message on Twitter about her visit.</p>
<p>A colleague, journalist Jason Fagone, mentioned to her that he was conducting research for a new book about Elizebeth. He forwarded some pictures he had taken of Elizebeth’s sketch of the tombstone, which he found in the George C. Marshall Library and Museum in Lexington, Virginia. Jason had been spending a great deal of time in the Marshall archives researching his excellent biography of Elizebeth, <em>The Woman Who Smashed Codes</em>, to be published later that year.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-24" id="c15-noteref-24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the pictures showed a handwritten note, created by Elizebeth in 1969, with a sketch of the inscription that was to be put on William’s tombstone after his death. The sketch included William’s name and life data, a blank space where Elizebeth’s information would be added after her own death, and, at the bottom of the tombstone, the words <code>KNOWLEDGE IS POWER</code>, a phrase that was a recurring theme throughout William’s and Elizebeth’s lives. When Elizebeth died in 1980, details of her own life were added to the tombstone.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_314" title="314"/>While examining Elizebeth’s sketch, Elonka noticed a potential steganographic message, hidden by the way that the letters were written in slightly different fonts. This message, concealed in the engraving <code>KNOWLEDGE IS POWER</code>, turned out to use the Baconian cipher, a cryptographic system well known to the Friedmans. They had used this steganographic technique before.</p>
<p>The <em>Baconian cipher</em>, which was invented by philosopher Francis Bacon in the early seventeenth century, can be used to hide a message in any text or picture (“anything can be made to signify anything”).<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-25" id="c15-noteref-25">25</a></sup> In order to use it with a text, we need two different fonts, A and B. In the following example, we use ordinary letters as font A and bold-italic letters as font B. Using these two styles, we can encode all letters of the alphabet (Bacon used a twenty-four-letter alphabet) by changing the position of the bold-italic letters, as shown here in the word <em>HOUSE</em>:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>A: HOUSE   B: HOUS</code><var class="bold">E</var><code>   C: HOU</code><var class="bold">S</var><code>E   D: HOU</code><var class="bold">SE</var></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>E: HO</code><var class="bold">U</var><code>SE   F: HO</code><var class="bold">U</var><code>S</code><var class="bold">E</var><code>   G: HO</code><var class="bold">US</var><code>E   H: HO</code><var class="bold">USE</var></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>I: H</code><var class="bold">O</var><code>USE   K: H</code><var class="bold">O</var><code>US</code><var class="bold">E</var><code>   L: H</code><var class="bold">O</var><code>U</code><var class="bold">S</var><code>E   M: H</code><var class="bold">O</var><code>U</code><var class="bold">SE</var></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>N: H</code><var class="bold">OU</var><code>SE   O: H</code><var class="bold">OU</var><code>S</code><var class="bold">E</var><code>   P: H</code><var class="bold">OUS</var><code>E   Q: H</code><var class="bold">OUSE</var></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>R:</code>  <var class="bold">H</var><code>OUSE   S: </code><var class="bold">H</var><code>OUS</code><var class="bold">E</var><code>   T: </code><var class="bold">H</var><code>OU</code><var class="bold">S</var><code>E   U: </code><var class="bold">H</var><code>OU</code><var class="bold">SE</var></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>W:</code>  <var class="bold">H</var><code>O</code><var class="bold">U</var><code>SE   X: </code><var class="bold">H</var><code>O</code><var class="bold">U</var><code>S</code><var class="bold">E</var><code>   Y: </code><var class="bold">H</var><code>O</code><var class="bold">US</var><code>E   Z: </code><var class="bold">H</var><code>O</code><var class="bold">USE</var></p>
<p>Using this system, hiding the word <code class="bold">WILLY</code> in the text <code>THIS IS AN ORDINARY SHORT TEXT</code> would look like the following:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><var class="bold">T</var><code>H</code><var class="bold">I</var><code>SI S</code><var class="bold">A</var><code>NOR D</code><var class="bold">I</var><code>N</code><var class="bold">A</var><code>R Y</code><var class="bold">S</var><code>H</code><var class="bold">O</var><code>R </code><var class="bold">T</var><code>T</code><var class="bold">EX</var><code>T</code></p>
<p>Or, written in a way that preserves the natural word boundaries:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><var class="bold">T</var><code>H</code><var class="bold">I</var><code>S IS </code><var class="bold">A</var><code>N ORD</code><var class="bold">I</var><code>N</code><var class="bold">A</var><code>RY </code><var class="bold">S</var><code>H</code><var class="bold">O</var><code>R</code><var class="bold">T</var><code> T</code><var class="bold">EX</var><code>T</code></p>

</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_315" title="315"/>The Baconian cipher is one of the earliest known binary codes in history, predating Morse code by over 200 years and ASCII code by over 300. When Elonka took a closer look at the Friedmans’ tombstone, she actually found a Baconian message in the words <code>KNOWLEDGE IS POWER</code>. Some of the letters spelling out this sentence have serifs (font A) and some do not (font B). This difference can be seen best in the <code>E</code>s; notice that the <code>E</code>s in the word <code>KNOWLEDGE</code> are slightly different from the one in <code>POWER</code>. Separating the letters with serifs from those without and transcribing them using our system of ordinary and bold-italic letters, we get the following:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><var class="bold">K</var><code>N</code><var class="bold">O</var><code>WLED</code><var class="bold">G</var><code>E </code><var class="bold">I</var><code>S P</code><var class="bold">O</var><code>W</code><var class="bold">E</var><code>R</code></p>
<p>Written in groups of five, the Baconian cipher can be easily decrypted:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><var class="bold">K</var><code>N</code><var class="bold">O</var><code>WL ED</code><var class="bold">G</var><code>E</code><var class="bold">I</var><code> SP</code><var class="bold">O</var><code>W</code><var class="bold">E</var> <code>R</code></p>
<p>The three groups encode the letters <code class="bold">WFF</code>. These are the initials of William Frederick Friedman. A brief message, to be sure, but very typical of the Friedmans.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502727c15-0002"><a class="XrefDestination" id="SuccessstoryDecipheringSteganographia"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c15-009"/>Success story: Deciphering Steganographia</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">In the year 1500, German abbot and humanist Johannes Trithemius (1462–1516) finished the most remarkable of his over ninety works, a three-book set titled <em>Steganographia</em>. The first two books describe over fifty variants of a communication method that we doubt ever worked. This method requires the sender to cast a certain magic spell, causing a ghost to appear. This ghost subsequently transmits the message with the help of a number of supporting ghosts. The receiver then needs to cast another magic spell in order to access the message. For every variant of this process, Trithemius provides long lists of parameters, such as the number and names of supporting ghosts.</p>
<p><em>Steganographia</em> gained instant notoriety, as it soon became known that the magic communication techniques described in the first two books were mere hoaxes. Their true purpose was to encode messages in the parameters listed: Trithemius disguised messages as descriptions of magic processes, a form of steganography. In fact, the title <em>Steganographia</em> even gave the science of steganography its name. The word “steganography” was, for centuries, used synonymously with “cryptography,” until David Kahn popularized the definition given at the beginning of this chapter in his 1967 book <em>The Codebreakers</em>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-26" id="c15-noteref-26">26</a></sup></p>
<p>We introduce here an example of a <em>Steganographia</em> communication method, using the description Jürgen Hermes provided in his 2012 PhD thesis.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-27" id="c15-noteref-27">27</a></sup> This method lists the following supporting “ghosts”:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom">Maseriel. B<b>u</b>l<b>a</b>n. Lamodyn. <b>C</b>h<b>a</b>r<b>n</b>o<b>t</b>y. Carmephin<em>. </em><b>I</b>a<b>b</b>r<b>u</b>n. Care. <b>S</b>a<b>t</b>h<b>r</b>o<b>y</b>n.

<p>If one only reads every second letter of every other word (which we have bolded for clarification), one gets the following Latin phrase (note <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_316" title="316"/>that we’ve distinguished <code class="bold">U</code> and <code class="bold">V</code>, as well as <code class="bold">I</code> and <code class="bold">Y</code>, which were used interchangeably):</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>VACANTIBUS TRIBUS TRES VALENT ITA PER TOTUM</code></p>
<p>This phrase, which translates to <code class="bold">AFTER THREE EMPTY ONES, THREE ARE VALID, THUS THROUGHOUT</code>, is an instruction for decrypting another text contained in the same chapter of <em>Steganographia</em>. According to these instructions, reading the message requires one to skip the first three words, take the initial letters of the next three, skip the following three, and so on. We obtained the following result (the valid initial letters are bolded for clarification):</p>
<p class="BodyCustom">Omnipotens sempiterne Deus <b>b</b>onorum <b>r</b>emunerator <b>æ</b>quissime, qui filium tuum <b>n</b>ostri <b>g</b>eneris <b>e</b>sse participem voluisti, ut <b>r</b>edimeret, <b>d</b>iabolica <b>i</b>nuidia nos miserrimos: qui <b>s</b>ola <b>b</b>enignitate <b>r</b>edundans, formam nostri suscepit <b>i</b>ncorruptam <b>e</b>x <b>f</b>lore virginalis uteri, archangelo <b>s</b>ancto <b>G</b>abriele <b>i</b>nsinuante, quod Virgo conceptura, <b>b</b>eatissimo <b>t</b>uo <b>S</b>piritui perpetua virgo permaneret, <b>i</b>mmaculata <b>c</b>larior <b>h</b>ominib. angelicisque spiritibus praeeminentior. <b>G</b>enuit <b>r</b>egem <b>o</b>mnipotentem, Deum et hominem, <b>s</b>antissima <b>e</b>t <b>r</b>euerendissima Virgo Maria, virilis <b>c</b>onsortii <b>o</b>mnino <b>n</b>escia, sine dolore pariens<em>, </em><b>s</b>ine <b>t</b>ristitia <b>v</b>agientem Deum hominemque suscipiens, <b>s</b>emper . . .</p>
<p>The bolded letters spell out the following German message:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>BRÆNGER DIS BRIEFS GIBT SICH GROSER CONST US</code></p>
<p>This means: <code class="bold">THE CARRIER OF THIS LETTER CONSIDERS HIMSELF VERY SKILLED</code>. As with all the messages in <em>Steganographia</em>, the content of this message was not as important as its steganographic delivery, which Trithemius was illustrating by example.</p>
<p>While the true purpose of the first two <em>Steganographia</em> books soon became common knowledge, the function of the <em>liber tertius</em>, or the third book, remained a mystery. On the surface, it describes magical communication methods, too, but these look quite different from the ones in the first two books. Here, the main parameters allegedly required to transmit a message with the help of planetary angels are three-digit numbers that are supposedly needed to calculate the movements of planets and their rulers. Long lists of these numbers are provided (see <a href="#figure15-8" id="figureanchor15-8">Figure 15-8</a>).</p>
<p>For centuries, highly regarded scholars tried to figure out what the third book of <em>Steganographia</em> was about. Did it encode messages, too, or was it meant to represent real magic? In the 1990s, almost 500 years after the creation of <em>Steganographia</em>, mathematician Jim Reeds, who worked for AT&amp;T, took a closer look at the third book. When he analyzed the table depicted in <a href="#figure15-8">Figure 15-8</a>, he noticed that, in the first column, all numbers listed were between <code>626</code> and <code>650</code>. So were the first ten numbers in the second column (those that appeared above the only written word in that column). This resulted in the following block of forty numbers between <code>626</code> and <code>650</code>:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>644, 650, 629, 650, 645, 635, 646, 636, 632, 646, 639 634, 641, 642, 649, 642, 648, 638, 634, 647, 632, 630, 642, 633, 648, 650, 655, 626, 650, 644, 638, 633, 635, 642, 632, 640, 637, 643, 638, 634</code></p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure15-8">Figure 15-8</a>: These numbers from the 1500 work <em>Steganographia</em> are allegedly astrological parameters. In reality, they encode a message.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This block is followed by numbers that are all greater than <code>650</code>. Reeds suspected that these forty numbers represented an encrypted message. Frequency analysis revealed that the number <code>650</code> was not only the highest but also the most frequent one. Did this number stand for the letter <code class="bold">A</code>, which has the highest frequency in the Latin language? If so, the following substitution rule appeared likely: <code>650</code> = <code class="bold">A</code>, <code>649</code> = <code class="bold">B</code>, <code>648</code> = <code class="bold">C</code>, <code>647</code> = <code class="bold">D</code>, <code>646</code> = <code class="bold">E</code>, etc. A short test revealed that this substitution resulted in Latin word fragments. After some experimentation, Reeds came up with the following table:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>650</code> = <code class="bold">A</code>, <code>649</code> = <code class="bold">B</code>, <code>648</code> = <code class="bold">C</code>, <code>647</code> = <code class="bold">D</code>, <code>646</code> = <code class="bold">E</code>, <code>645</code> = <code class="bold">F</code>, <code>644</code> = <code class="bold">G</code>, <code>643</code> = <code class="bold">H</code>, <code>642</code> = <code class="bold">I</code>, <code>641</code> = <code class="bold">L</code>, <code>640</code> = <code class="bold">M</code>, <code>639</code> = <code class="bold">N</code>, <code>638</code> = <code class="bold">O</code>, <code>637</code> = <code class="bold">P</code>, <code>636</code> = <code class="bold">Q</code>, <code>635</code> = <code class="bold">R</code>, <code>634</code> = <code class="bold">S</code>, <code>633</code> = <code class="bold">T</code>, <code>632</code> = <code class="bold">U</code>, <code>631</code> = <code class="bold">X</code>, <code>630</code> = <code class="bold">Y</code>, <code>629</code> = <code class="bold">Z</code>, <code>628</code> = <code class="bold">TZ</code>, <code>627</code> = <code class="bold">SCH</code>, <code>626</code> = <code class="bold">TH</code></p>
<p>The alphabet used here lacked <code class="bold">J</code> (which is identified with <code class="bold">I</code> in Latin), <code class="bold">K</code> (which is rarely used in Latin), <code class="bold">V</code> (which is identified with <code class="bold">U</code> in Latin), and <code class="bold">W</code> (which does not exist in Latin). All this seemed to show that Reeds was on the right track and that the aforementioned forty-letter block decrypted as follows:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>GAZA FREQUENS LIBICOS DUXIT CARTHAGO TRIUMPHOS</code></p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_318" title="318"/>With this Latin phrase, which translates to <code class="bold">FREQUENTLY, CARTHAGE RECEIVED RICH BOOTY FROM THE DEFEATED LIBYANS</code>, the true meaning of the <em>Steganographia</em>’s third book was finally revealed—500 years after its creation. Reeds easily deciphered the remaining six tables with similar methods. The substitution tables he produced looked very similar to the one above, except that twenty-five, fifty, or seventy-five had to be added to or subtracted from the three-digit numbers. In other words: the relevant part was the remainder after division by twenty-five. Here are the plaintexts Reeds discovered:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>GAZA FREQUENS LIBICOS DUXIT CARTHAGO TRIUMPHOS</code> [repeated four times]</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>LIBER GETRUWER HINTUMB DIE ZWELFE WART UNSER</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>HEIMLICHE EFUR DER PORTEN AMEN</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>NIT LAIS DUHER ZU MIR NOIT GCH ANDEL US ZUDAS ICH LDEN BRENGE AIL WEIS SOCH BEHALT</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>COMMEST NOCH HINTWAN IS DUET HABE EIN GROSEN RICHTEN MIT DIR DIR HAB MIT DIR UND SEHD DIS ALLES GEBEN ZUALS DUNUST UQREBI DIR SERE HAHW</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>BRENGER DIS BRIEFFS IST EIN BOSER SCHALG UND EIN DIEB HUET DICH FUR EME ER WIRT DICH AN</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>MISERERE MEI DEUS SECUNDU MAGNUM DONUM TUUM AMEN ATH</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>GAZA FREQUENS LIBICOS DUXIT CARTHAGO TRIUMPHOS WTZSCH</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>GAZA FREQUENS LIBICOS DU RTHAGO XIT CA TRIUMPHOS SCH</code></p>
<p>Again, the content of these messages was not particularly important. Trithemius probably chose the phrase <code class="bold">GAZA FREQUENS LIBICOS DUXIT CARTHAGO TRIUMPHOS</code> because it includes all of the letters of the Latin language using only a few words—which makes breaking a message with frequency analysis more difficult. This sentence can be regarded as a Latin equivalent of “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,” which is often used today to test fonts, printers, and keyboards.</p>
<p>The message beginning with <code class="bold">BRENGER DIS BRIEFFS</code> is German for “The carrier of this letter is a bad rogue and thief; be careful, he will betray you.” The text beginning with <code class="bold">MISERERE MEI</code> stems from the Bible (Psalm 51).</p>
<p>In 1998, Jim Reeds published his findings in the scientific journal <em>Cryptologia</em>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-28" id="c15-noteref-28">28</a></sup> While working on his article, however, he came across an astonishing research paper from 1996, published in the literature journal <em>Daphnis</em> by our colleague, the Germanist Thomas Ernst.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-29" id="c15-noteref-29">29</a></sup> As Reeds looked through the 200-page tome, he could hardly believe what he saw: apparently, Ernst had also solved the third book of the <em>Steganographia</em> just two years earlier!</p>
<p>This means that 500 years after the creation of <em>Steganographia</em>, two researchers—a mathematician and a Germanist—solved the mystery of the third book at almost the same time and independently of each other. This sounds like a Dan Brown story, but it is real.</p>
<p>Ernst broke Trithemius’s steganographic cipher with the same initial table used by Reeds a few years later (see <a href="#figure15-8">Figure 15-8</a>). The table was sectionalized by the Greek symbols, some of which spelled out Greek letters such as alpha (<span class="NSSymbol">αλϕα</span>), beta (<span class="NSSymbol">βητα</span>), gamma (<span class="NSSymbol">γαμμα</span>), and delta (<span class="NSSymbol">δελτα</span>) in addition to the numbers. Transcription was difficult, and there are likely <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_319" title="319"/>to be small errors here and there. Ernst assumed the Greek symbols to be separators. A simplified transcript, from a 1608 version of <em>Steganographia</em>, is here:</p>

<p>The four groups headlined “alpha (α),” “beta (β),” “gamma (γ),” and “delta (δ)” contained forty numbers each, and Ernst thus assumed that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_320" title="320"/>these four columns represented the same text. The first number of each group differed from the others by exactly twenty-five (they are <code>644</code>, <code>669</code>, <code>694</code>, and <code>719</code>). The same was true for the second, third, fourth, and all subsequent numbers of each group. Because every number in each group was removed from those of the other groups by a factor of twenty-five, the four groups were identical.</p>
<p>The number <code>650</code>, which appears twice among the first four letters of the alpha group, delivered the breakthrough. Ernst guessed that <code>650</code> stood for either the first or the last letter of the Latin alphabet and that Trithemius had used either the substitution table <code class="bold">A</code> = <code>650</code>, <code class="bold">B</code> = <code>651</code>, <code class="bold">C</code> = <code>652</code>, etc. or <code class="bold">Z</code> = <code>650</code>, <code class="bold">Y</code> = <code>651</code>, <code class="bold">X</code> = <code>652</code>, etc. When he checked the first hypothesis, he didn’t get a meaningful result, but the second one appeared to work. The first word he derived was <code class="bold">GAZA</code>, and his decryption of the rest of the text quickly fell into place.</p>
<p>Having found the solution, Ernst started to write his detailed research paper (in German) about his decryption, to be published in 1996. His research was comprehensive, leading him to another related unsolved cipher: Heidel’s cryptogram.</p>
<p>In 1676, Wolfgang Ernst Heidel had also claimed to have solved Trithemius’s third book, but he had only published an encrypted version of his solution, using a polyalphabetic cipher. Heidel’s ciphertext was known in cryptological circles, but for the next three centuries, no one was able to crack it. Ernst thus accomplished another first, deciphering Heidel’s cryptogram and proving that the solution of Trithemius’s third book had already been found in the seventeenth century. Tom’s original paper about his own solution continued to expand, incorporating the information about Heidel’s cryptogram and a great deal more of the historical background. It eventually reached the substantial size of 200 pages, the length of a book. After three years, Tom’s work was published in <em>Daphnis</em>.</p>
<p>Two years later, Reeds came across Tom’s publication while working on his own <em>Cryptologia</em> article. After Reeds informed the <em>Cryptologia</em> editors about Tom’s work, they asked Ernst to provide a shortened version of his paper.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-30" id="c15-noteref-30">30</a></sup> So, in the October 1998 edition of <em>Cryptologia</em>, two articles about the decipherment of the third <em>Steganographia</em> book were published—written by two authors who hadn’t known about each other.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that the double decipherment of the third book of <em>Steganographia</em> is a highlight in the history of codebreaking. To learn more about this fascinating story, see the 1998 article “A Mystery Unraveled, Twice” in the <em>New York Times</em>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-31" id="c15-noteref-31">31</a></sup> Twenty years later, the story again came to public awareness via a few German-language publications in Thomas Ernst’s home country, including a comprehensive blog post by Jürgen Hermes<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-32" id="c15-noteref-32">32</a></sup> and two treatises written by Klaus.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-33" id="c15-noteref-33">33</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-34" id="c15-noteref-34">34</a></sup></p>

<p>This particular image was one of several in the book that decrypted to two different sentences. One sentence was encoded by counting the scales on each serpent in a set of pages, and another was encoded with the numbers on their tails. The cipher key was in the form of a 5 × 5 lookup table. The numbers of either the tails or scales were used in pairs to represent the row and column of a letter in the table. The treasure was found in 2004, sixteen months after the book was published.

<p class="BodyFirst">A Baconian cipher can be found not only on William and Elizebeth Friedman’s tombstone but also in a book they wrote. Their 1957 work titled <em>The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined</em> evaluates a number of theories alleging that Francis Bacon (1561–1626) was the real author of the works usually attributed to William Shakespeare (1564–1616), and that Bacon included hidden messages in these writings that confirmed his authorship.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-36" id="c15-noteref-36">36</a></sup> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_322" title="322"/>The story is of personal interest to the Friedmans, as it was through this research that they met. In the early 1900s, Elizebeth (née Smith) had been hired by the eccentric millionaire George Fabyan to search for hidden messages in Shakespeare’s works. While working at Fabyan’s think tank in Riverbank Laboratories near Chicago, she met a researcher in a different part of the lab, the young geneticist William Friedman. As a photographer, he helped with her research. She taught him about codes, they fell in love, and the rest is history. In their 1957 book, the Friedmans took time to closely examine the Shakespeare-Bacon controversy and definitively show that all the Bacon code theories were nonsense.</p>
<p>In their typical tongue-in-cheek style, within their book about why there weren’t Baconian messages in the works of Shakespeare, the Friedmans hid a message in a Baconian cipher! On page 257 of the book, the following lines can be read:</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Encryption played an important role in World War I, especially for protecting radio messages. Virtually all systems used were either manual or based on simple tools, such as cipher disks and cipher slides. Unfortunately, most of these methods were broken by enemy forces quite quickly. They also suffered a further weakness in that they were complicated to use, especially in wartime conditions. Soldiers who had to encrypt or decrypt text while taking cover in a trench, suffering from bad weather, and being distracted by gunshots and bomb explosions nearby were already overtaxed. Inevitably, many errors occurred. Often, a recipient could not even decrypt an encrypted message due to a faulty encipherment.</p>
<p>Based on these experiences, many new encryption techniques were developed in the years following World War I. Because it had become obvious that manual encryption was not suited for high-security and high-volume radio traffic at any time, let alone under wartime conditions, new encryption machines were designed to be more secure and user-friendly than manual ciphers (see <a href="#figure15-10" id="figureanchor15-10">Figure 15-10</a>). The concept of cipher machines was not necessarily new, as some designs had already been in existence for decades. But after the failure of cryptography in World War I, the pressure was high enough to finally put these ideas into practice.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_323" title="323"/><figure>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure15-10">Figure 15-10</a>: Mechanical and electrical encryption machines reached their peak of<em> usage from approximately 1920 to 1970. The picture shows a Siemens &amp; Halske T52</em><em> (a), a Kryha Standard</em> (b), a KL-7 (c), and a Hagelin C-35 (d).

<p>The most popular type of encryption apparatus was the so-called rotor cipher machine. This kind of device comprises a typewriter-like keyboard, an output unit (some designs used a set of lamps, with every lamp indicating a letter of the alphabet), a source of current, and a set of rotors. The diagram in <a href="#figure15-11" id="figureanchor15-11">Figure 15-11</a> shows a simplified three-rotor design with an alphabet of six letters. Real machines, of course, worked with an alphabet of twenty-six or more letters.</p>
<p>To encrypt a letter, the operator presses a key. This completes an electrical connection, which makes a lamp representing a ciphertext letter light up. After each letter is entered, the rightmost rotor turns by one unit. After a complete turn of this rotor, the next one turns by one unit, too, and once this one has revolved, the last one moves by one unit, like an odometer counter. Decryption on these machines works in a similar way: they need to be switched to a different mode, which causes the current to flow in the opposite direction through the rotors. The operator enters the ciphertext letter by pressing a key, after which the plaintext letter is indicated by a lamp.</p>

</figure>
<p>The most famous rotor machine (as well as the most famous encryption machine ever) is the Enigma (see <a href="#figure15-12" id="figureanchor15-12">Figure 15-12</a>), which was developed in the 1920s. The Germans used about 30,000 copies of the Enigma in World War II.</p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure15-12">Figure 15-12</a>: The Enigma, used by the Germans in World War II, is the most famous encryption machine in history.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_325" title="325"/>In its most common configuration, the Enigma had three rotors, a plugboard to add a further level of complexity to the process, and an additional part called a <em>reflector</em> (see <a href="#figure15-13" id="figureanchor15-13">Figure 15-13</a>). From 1942 on, German U-boats used a four-rotor version of the Enigma, also with a reflector. Concentration camps and police also made use of the Enigma.</p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure15-13">Figure 15-13</a>: The Enigma is a rotor machine. Contrary to most designs of this kind, it included an additional element, referred to as a reflector.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The reflector caused the current to run twice through the rotors: once forward to the reflector, and then back to the rotors again. Due to this reflection, encryption and decryption worked exactly the same way; no decryption mode was necessary. This made the operation of the Enigma easier, but it also turned out to be a design weakness that helped the Allies to break the Enigma’s encryption system.</p>
<p>As early as the 1930s, three young Polish mathematicians from the University of Poznań, Marian Rejewski and his associates Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy Różycki, found some of the weaknesses in the Enigma encryption algorithm, which allowed them to break messages regularly.</p>
<p>They created a device, a “bomba kryptologiczna” (cryptologic bomb), which assisted with their efforts. According to their contemporary at Bletchley Park, Gordon Welchman, Różycki proposed the “bomba” codename for the machine based on a type of ice cream that was popular at the time; they were eating this dessert when Rejewski came up with the idea for the machine.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-37" id="c15-noteref-37">37</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-38" id="c15-noteref-38">38</a></sup> Other reports claim that the name was chosen spontaneously or perhaps because of the sounds the machine made.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-39" id="c15-noteref-39">39</a></sup></p>
<p>After Poland was invaded by the Germans, Rejewski and his team escaped and provided their methodology and a Polish copy of the Enigma to aid in the Allies’ work at Bletchley Park, a country estate outside London, where thousands of workers broke Enigma messages in a factory-like facility. British codebreakers, among them renowned mathematician Alan Turing, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_326" title="326"/>developed their own machine to help with their efforts. The design was partially based on the work of the Polish cryptanalysts, especially their deduction of the wiring of the Enigma rotors, but was otherwise substantially different. The British called their own machine a Bombe, and hundreds were built by the British Tabulating Machine Company for the war effort.</p>
<p>Other analysts around the world were also attacking the Enigma ciphers. The British codebreaker Dillwyn “Dilly” Knox broke Enigma messages in the 1930s as well. Also, informed by the British, the Americans started their own Enigma-breaking efforts, building an improved version of the Bombe targeted at the four-rotor version of the Enigma that was used by German U-boats. This initiative was spearheaded by Joseph Desch in Dayton, Ohio. Today, Joseph’s daughter, Deb (Desch) Anderson, is an excellent resource for anything related to the Dayton Codebreakers.</p>
<p>Independently of all of the above, Elizebeth Friedman had her own pencil-and-paper way of cracking Enigma messages, as she was systematically attacking Nazi ciphers in South America.</p>
<p>Today, there are museums in both Poznań and Bletchley Park that tell the story of some of the Enigma cryptanalysis in a fascinating way. There is also a tremendous amount of literature on this topic; we especially recommend David Kahn’s <em>Seizing the Enigma</em> (1991)<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-40" id="c15-noteref-40">40</a></sup> and Tom and Dan Perera’s <em>Inside Enigma</em> (2019), which are available on the EnigmaMuseum.com website.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-41" id="c15-noteref-41">41</a></sup> <em>Demystifying the Bombe</em> (2014) by Dermot Turing (the nephew of Alan Turing) may be interesting for codebreakers, as it explains the Bombe in an easy-to-understand way.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-42" id="c15-noteref-42">42</a></sup> Then there are the movies <em>Enigma</em> (2001), with Kate Winslet; and <em>The Imitation Game</em> (2014), with Benedict Cumberbatch. We also recommend the documentary <em>Dayton Codebreakers </em>(2005).</p>
<p>Apart from rotor machines, numerous other types of electrical or mechanical encryption machines were created during a “golden age” that spanned World War II and the early Cold War. For instance, in World War II, Japanese diplomats used a cipher device that their US war opponents named PURPLE.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-43" id="c15-noteref-43">43</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-44" id="c15-noteref-44">44</a></sup> The full Japanese name was “System 97 Typewriter for European Characters” (<span class="JapaneseChar">九七式欧文印字機</span>, or 97-shiki ōbun injiki). The cipher was broken by one of William Friedman’s teams in the US Army Signal Intelligence Service, led by Frank Rowlett. They did so by looking for helpful phrases that the Japanese used frequently at the beginning of their radio messages, such as “I have the honor to inform your excellency,” which often provided a crib with which to start.</p>
<p>Two side notes about terminology:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>There is debate as to the origin of the name PURPLE. According to Stephen Budiansky in his 2000 book <em>Battle of Wits</em>,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-45" id="c15-noteref-45">45</a></sup> American codebreakers named two of the earlier Japanese naval encryption systems, which were codes and not ciphers, “Red” and “Blue” because of the colors of the binders in which they kept the intercepted messages. They named other Japanese encryption systems other colors, such as JADE and CORAL, though it is not clear whether these names were also related to the color of their containers.</li>
<li>There were two completely different Japanese encryption systems both code-named “Red.” One of these, mentioned above, was a true code <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_327" title="327"/>that used a codebook; the other was an unrelated cipher system whose messages were encrypted and decrypted with a machine. To distinguish the two, the codebook version was typically spelled normally, such as “Red” or perhaps “Red Book,” while all machine cipher systems were generally referred to in all caps: RED, PURPLE, etc. But, to make things even more confusing, the cipher systems were sometimes (incorrectly) referred to as codes, as in the “Purple Code” system, which was really a cipher. Also, sometimes the code systems, not the cipher versions, were referred to in all caps! See <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 7"><a href="c07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a></span> for more information about the terminology confusion between codes and ciphers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another important World War II–era German encryption machine, whose existence was only declassified in the last twenty years, was the Lorenz SZ40/42, also known by the British as “Tunny,” meaning “tuna fish.” It was introduced in 1940 as a cipher attachment that could be added in-line to large teleprinter machines, so it was not portable like the Enigma. It was used only at the highest military levels, such as for Hitler’s direct communications with his generals. The Lorenz had twelve notched wheels and over five hundred pins, and it would encrypt the outgoing text and decrypt the incoming text of a teletype.</p>
<p>The device could accept input via Baudot on five-bit punched paper tape or manually. Then it would rapidly translate the plaintext into an encrypted version of Baudot code and send it to the receiver via radio or landline. At the receiving end, another in-line Lorenz attachment would decrypt the message and send it on to the receiver teleprinter so that a plaintext message could be printed out. All of this was considerably faster than the laborious letter-by-letter process required by the Enigma.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-46" id="c15-noteref-46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>Any mention of the Lorenz was kept classified for decades after World War II. Information about it only began to emerge in 1995, after the publication of a paper by Donald Davies in <em>Cryptologia</em>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-47" id="c15-noteref-47">47</a></sup> Following this publication, the US and UK governments gradually began declassifying various related documents over the next several years.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-48" id="c15-noteref-48">48</a></sup> Now that a more complete picture of the Lorenz system has emerged, we know that it was another of the encryption methods cracked at Bletchley Park—this time in 1942 by a team including John Tiltman and William T. “Bill” Tutte. This was an impressive accomplishment, considering they had never even seen the machine.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-49" id="c15-noteref-49">49</a></sup> Another team of fifty people, put together and led by Thomas H. Flowers, designed a different kind of decryption machine, distinct from the Bombe, to assist with efforts to decrypt the Tunny messages. It was called the Colossus, and it was a massive, room-sized apparatus that could be reconfigured from day to day. A Post Office factory in Birmingham was commandeered to build the necessary parts, and as the war went on, ten different Colossi were constructed.</p>
<p>After the Tunny’s system was broken, the strategic intelligence gathered from it provided substantial information, both about the movements of the German army and about the German leadership’s understanding (or misunderstanding) of Allied plans. According to Colossus engineer Thomas <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_328" title="328"/>Flowers, on June 5, 1944, a decrypted message was provided to US General Dwight D. Eisenhower showing that, though the Germans knew there was a planned invasion of Normandy, they didn’t believe it was real. They thought, instead, that it was just a feint to draw German troops away from the ports.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-50" id="c15-noteref-50">50</a></sup> This intelligence was thus a key factor in the Allied decision to launch the full “Operation Overlord” invasion of France on D-Day (June 6), which turned the tide of the war for the Allies in Europe.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-51" id="c15-noteref-51">51</a></sup> Historians looking back on this era estimate that the intel from Bletchley, including the Tunny decrypts, shortened the war in Europe by several months. In 1954, Eisenhower described it as being of priceless value and that it had saved thousands of British and American lives.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-52" id="c15-noteref-52">52</a></sup></p>
<p>While early cipher machine designs, including the German Enigma and the Japanese PURPLE, could be broken, the more advanced ones, especially those of the Cold War, are still considered secure today. With the advent of inexpensive electronics and computers around 1970, electrical and mechanical encryption machines gradually became obsolete over the next decades, though they remained in use to some extent in less-developed countries.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-53" id="c15-noteref-53">53</a></sup> Today, while this technology has a fascinating history, it no longer plays a role in modern communication security.</p>
<p>Breaking the ciphers of vintage encryption machines with modern means (i.e., with computer support) is an active field of research. In <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 16"><a href="c16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a></span>, we will address Enigma breaking with hill climbing. If you want to know more, read Craig Bauer’s 2013 book <em>Secret History </em>(or the second edition published in 2021), which presents a great deal of mathematical background on cipher machines and introduces methods to break their encryption.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-54" id="c15-noteref-54">54</a></sup></p>

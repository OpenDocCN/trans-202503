- en: Android launched an early version of the SDK long before it shipped 1.0, or
    the source code, or any physical hardware. Launching the SDK early gave developers
    plenty of time to learn about Android and build and test their applications. Early
    access to the platform also gave the team a chance for feedback from developers,
    pointing out problems that needed to be fixed before 1.0\.

    The OHA was an important step toward the ecosystem that the team envisioned. In
    stark opposition to the traditional model exemplified by Apple and Microsoft,
    where a single company controls the platform, the OHA promised to provide an open
    source platform that could be used by all companies. It was a collection of carriers,
    hardware manufacturers, and software companies, including:'

    at Symbian, the most prevalent mobile phone operating system in the world at that
    time, said in an interview with BBC, “Search and a mobile phone platform are completely
    different things. It’s costly, arduous, and at times a deeply unsexy job of supporting
    customers day by day in launching phones. That’s something there’s very little
    experience of in Google’s environment. They are talking about having a phone by
    the end of next year. It’s not one that is going to ignite developers.”

    with a build that was lovingly labeled *m3*.^([5](#c39-footnote-5))
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the original OHA announcement went out, the SDK was completely ready. But
    the decision was made to do the press release first and let it float out there
    a few days before dropping the code. This allowed time for industry sentiment
    and general misbelief to fester. Six days later, the team shipped the actual software,
    making the announcement very real indeed.

    with it, and start building apps against it, but it wasn’t final by a long stretch.
    For example, that first release had an emulator that looked like the Sooner device
    (complete with a hardware keyboard taking up more space than the tiny screen,
    but that also had touch support the actual Sooner device lacked). The emulator
    also had many functional apps already. Android really was a mostly complete system,
    albeit without a physical device to ship on and with APIs that were not yet final.

    on the [https://www.android.com/](https://www.android.com/) website, including
    emulators that still run. Why you would want to spend time with these pre-release
    versions of Android is another question, but it’s cool that you can; Android has
    always been about openness, and that apparently extends to obsolete versions of
    the operating system that never actually shipped with running hardware.

    It’s one thing to have an internal code name that the team uses. It can probably
    be anything, because the wider world may never know and there won’t be any conflicts
    with other people’s or companies’ own products or names.^([8](#c39-footnote-8))
    But when that internal product becomes external and public, things get complicated.
    You have to do trademark searches. When someone already has the rights to the
    name you wanted, you have to figure out what to do about it, which usually involves
    coming up with a new name.

    not be available for use externally. Dianne said, “I remember us being really
    worried about the potential name change, because the word Android at that point
    was used everywhere—all over the SDK, everywhere. If we had to change it in our
    APIs it was going to be a mess.”

    getting anyone to use it. When the SDK was released, it had exactly zero users
    outside of the Android team in the entire world, and it would be many months until
    that number could possibly change, since Android devices would not be available
    to purchase until 1.0 was released. The team had to figure out how to get developers
    interested in investing their time and energy in this new and speculative platform
    with zero users.

    about Android, on November 12, 2007, ended with a tantalizing hook: *“We’re really
    looking forward to seeing all the amazing applications that developers will create
    on an open mobile phone platform. In fact, you may even want to enter your application
    into the* *Android Developer Challenge—a USD $10 million challenge sponsored by
    Google to support and recognize developers who build great applications for the

    until April 14 and then sent them off to judges around the world to come up with
    the short list of the top 50 apps. Those 50 developers were awarded $25,000 each
    and asked to submit for a second round. From that second round, the top 10 apps
    were awarded $275,000 each, and the second 10 $100,000 each. If you do the math,
    that’s five million dollars Google gave away in this single contest.

    couldn’t even be offered to users at that point. Nobody outside of Android could
    even get a device that would run these apps at that time; the finalists were announced
    in August of 2008, a full two months before the first G1 was available for sale.
    But the challenge definitely got developers interested, as 1,788 apps were entered
    into the contest for this platform with zero users and an unknown release date.

    the experience of onboarding all of these developers and getting their feedback
    also helped the platform team get things in better shape for the eventual launch
    of 1.0\. Dirk Dougherty explained: “We had to figure out how to write apps, and
    then explain that. And deal with all the feedback. We think we get a lot of feedback
    today, but this was a brand-new API surface, on a brand-new platform, and no one
    had really written apps with this kind of access to sensors and things like that
    before. So there were tons of new use cases that we hadn’t thought of.”'

    judges across the world that were known to the developer community. They wanted
    to make things easy for these remote judges, but Android wasn’t “easy” at that
    point at all. To run an application, a judge had to install the SDK on their computer,
    run the tools, boot up the emulator, run a command to load the app into the emulator,
    and launch the app. With nearly 1,800 apps to judge, that wasn’t going to scale.

    developer relations team had written that launched the emulator and had a UI to
    choose the app to test, which installed and ran it on the emulator. “We shipped
    out a laptop to every one of the judges around the world. It was crazy! Most of
    these laptops never came back. One came back in a box packed with all kinds of
    stuffed animals, for some reason.”

    cheat by entering the contest as a Google employee: Jeff was recruited by the
    platform team because the team saw his work in the contest. “I was invited to
    Mountain View to develop on confidential devices (the G1). I was so excited I
    didn’t actually work on the app while in Mountain View. Instead, I wrote another
    app^([13](#c39-footnote-13)) that would do area-code-to-city caller ID lookup

    users and Android Market was open for business. Now Android had a real user and

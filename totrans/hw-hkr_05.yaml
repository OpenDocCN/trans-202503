    and that leads to problems like fake and copycat products. This part of the book
    takes a nuanced look at China’s IP ecosystem and finds a novel way to reward innovation
    that serves as an alternative to traditional Western IP practices.

    relatively straightforward to answer; anything that’s not an original must be
    a fake. The situation becomes muddied, however, when you consider the possibility
    that some contract manufacturers produce fakes by running a *ghost shift*, an
    after-hours production run not reported to the product’s brand owner. These items
    are produced on the same equipment, by the same people, and with the same procedures
    as the original product, but they’re sold directly to customers at a much higher
    margin to the manufacturer.'

    damaged goods get upcycled; production rejects with minor flaws are refurbished
    and sold as originals; original products get relabeled to advertise a higher capability
    or capacity (for example, memory cards with 4GB actual capacity are sold as 8GB),
    and so on. [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04) relates several encounters I’ve had with
    fake goods in China, and dives into the issues and incentives enabling the rise
    of such fakes.

    shadowy group of rogue innovators known as *shanzhai* creates products that attempt
    to mimic the features and function of an original product, often with assistance
    from the original’s blueprints. But the clones are heavily modified to save cost
    or include unique features. Often, the most offensive aspect of the practice is
    the use of the original product’s brands and trade dress on the clones. Aside
    from trademark violations, a look inside the products reveals an incredible amount
    of original engineering and innovation.

    they can achieve what few Western companies can: they can build complete mobile
    phones, and on a shoestring budget to boot. [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#ch05) takes
    a deep dive into a prime example of shanzhai engineering, a feature phone designed
    for emerging markets that costs under $10\. The phone is a tour de force of cost
    reduction and a fresh look at ways of building to address markets that are untouchable
    with Western engineering practices.'

    of complex systems on a shoestring budget is the shanzhai method for sharing IP.
    I’ll explore this by comparing and contrasting the Western notion of open source
    with the shanzhai method, which I refer to as *gongkai*. In Western law, open
    source has a formal definition, referring specifically to an IP sharing system
    governed by an explicit license to share. This license is granted by the copyright
    holder, often with significant commercial restrictions. Open source advocates
    vigorously defend this notion and are quick to dis-avow any IP that doesn’t explicitly
    use an approved license.

    you please; it doesn’t matter who made them. Yet people still share their ideas
    because the blueprints act as an advertisement. Blueprints often refer explicitly
    to certain chips or contain contact information for the firm that drew them. The
    creators hope circulating their blueprints will bring business to their factory
    when people order parts or sub-assemblies referenced within, or when people call
    their firm to improve or customize the design. In other cases, blueprints are
    traded. For example, there are bulletin board exchanges where before you download
    a blueprint, you must contribute one of your own.

    but optimized for hardware-oriented businesses. Just as Google provides high-quality
    search, email, and mapping services for free in exchange for showing ads, shanzhai
    innovators share ideas to land follow-up orders in their factories.

    in Shenzhen: everyone who is anyone in Shenzhen owns or has close ties to a factory.
    The fastest path to material wealth is selling more product. Arguing over who
    has rights to abstract ideas is a waste of effort best left for *baijiu*-fueled
    discussions after dinner.[*](footnote.xhtml#fn5) On the opposite end of the spectrum
    are Western patent trolls so removed from factories that they probably don’t even
    have a soldering iron, yet they invest millions of dollars into litigation and
    collecting royalties on ideas they didn’t invent.'

- en: Neither system is perfect, but the gongkai method is uniquely adapted to the
    fast pace of technology. In a world where chips get faster and cheaper every couple
    of years, a 20-year patent lifetime is an eternity. Spending a decade to bring
    a product to market simply is not an option; the best factories in China can turn
    a napkin sketch into a prototype in days and bring it to scale production in weeks.
    Long patent terms may be appropriate for markets like pharmaceuticals, but in
    fast-moving markets, investing months and tens of thousands of dollars in lawyer
    fees to negotiate a license or just apply for a patent can lead to missed opportunities.

    The gongkai ecosystem is living proof that granting 20-year monopolies on ideas
    as trivial as “slide to unlock” for a smartphone may not be the One True Path
    to incentivize innovation. I look forward to starting the conversation with this
    whirlwind tour of the good, the bad, and the ugly of the Chinese IP.

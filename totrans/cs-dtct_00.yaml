    Frank started for his crossbow, but pulled up short. If the Vinettees were coming
    for him, they would have knocked—with an axe. Whoever was coming through the door
    must want to talk. Frank reached for his mug instead and downed the remainder
    of his now-cold coffee.

    had paid him exactly two visits, and both had been to warn him to stay away from
    active cases. Threats were all Frank had come to expect, but now it seemed the
    captain had a special kind of problem—perhaps the kind that would mean an end
    to Frank’s delinquent rent.

    of documents, everything from property disputes to expense reports. They took
    all the ledgers we keep on assassins, celebrities, private investigators, notaries

    “Ever since the trouble with that crackpot wizard, the king insists on daily briefings
    on everything.” Two years ago, a megalomaniac wizard named Exponentious had tried
    to destroy the entire kingdom. Since then King Fredrick had personally instituted
    sweeping upgrades to the kingdom’s security, with over 300 new security regulations,
    at least 5 of which dealt with the storage of official documents in government
    buildings under 10 stories tall.

    of the kingdom by cursing the scholars who studied those algorithms. Within months
    he had rendered even simple operations inefficient, and the kingdom had started
    to grind to a halt. Evidence of the damage had been everywhere; even in his local
    bakery, Frank had himself witnessed panic break out as customers discovered they
    couldn’t remember how to arrange themselves into a line.

    he said, “I’m going to do things my way.”

    badge that very afternoon. But, then again, doing things his own way had always
    gotten Frank results.

  zh: 最后，弗兰克叹了口气，夸张地抓起一张羊皮纸开始做笔记。
- en: The first step in any search problem is determining what it is you hope to find—the
    *target*, as his old instructor in Police Algorithms 101 called it. Frank had
    learned that lesson early; he’d been tasked in his first week as an officer with
    finding the duke’s prize stallion, and he’d proudly returned to the station that
    same afternoon with a 42-pound horned turtle. Apparently, the impressive reptile
    wasn’t good enough. A good search algorithm means nothing if you’re looking for
    the wrong thing.

  zh: 任何搜索问题的第一步是确定你希望找到的目标——正如他在《警察算法 101》课上的老教授所说的，叫做*目标*。弗兰克很早就学到了这个教训；他在刚成为警察的第一周就被指派去寻找公爵的奖马，结果那天下午他就带着一只42磅重的角龟回到了警局。显然，这只令人印象深刻的爬行动物并不符合要求。如果你在寻找错误的东西，即使是再好的搜索算法也没有意义。
- en: In this case it wasn’t a *what*, but rather a *who*. The captain had been right
    about that point. Once the thieves had the documents, it didn’t matter if the
    police got them back. The thieves already had whatever information they needed.
  id: totrans-41

  zh: 在这个案例中，问题不是*什么*，而是*谁*。队长在这一点上说得对。既然小偷已经拿到了文件，警察是否能找回来已经不再重要。小偷已经得到了他们需要的所有信息。

- en: The second step in any search problem is identifying the *search space*. What
    are you searching? During Frank’s daily search for his keys, the search space
    was every flat surface in his office. And when Frank wanted to find a criminal,
    his search space was every person in the vicinity of the capital.

  zh: 任何搜索问题的第二步是确定*搜索空间*。你在搜寻什么？在弗兰克每天寻找钥匙的过程中，搜索空间是办公室里的每一块平面。而当弗兰克想要找到一个罪犯时，他的搜索空间就是首都周围的每一个人。

    criminal in a city of criminals. But he had seen worse.

  zh: 弗兰克坐回椅子，揉了揉眼睛。这是一个大搜索问题，在一个犯罪分子遍布的城市中寻找特定的罪犯。但他见过更糟糕的情况。
- en: Now that he had defined the problem, he could start on an algorithm. A linear
    search was out; he couldn’t afford to question everyone in the city. He could
    also rule out many of the other, fancier algorithms he had studied in the academy.
    For a problem like this, he would have to go back to his toolkit of basic search
    algorithms—the private investigator’s most trusted friends.

  zh: 既然他已经定义了问题，就可以开始设计算法了。线性搜索不适用；他无法承担在整个城市里询问每个人的成本。他也可以排除许多他在学院里学过的更复杂的算法。对于这样的问题，他必须回到自己基本的搜索算法工具包——私家侦探最信赖的朋友。

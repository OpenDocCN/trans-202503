<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/common01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this book we explore using Racket (a language descended from the Scheme family of programming languages—which in turn descended from Lisp) and DrRacket, a graphical environment that allows us to make the most of all the features of Racket. One of the attractive features of this ecosystem is that it’s equipped with a plethora of libraries that cover a wide range of disciplines. The developers describe Racket as a system that has “batteries included.” This makes it an ideal platform for the interactive investigation of various topics in computer science and mathematics.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Given Racket’s Lisp pedigree, we would be remiss to omit functional programming, so we will definitely explore it in this text. Racket is no one-trick pony though, so we will also explore imperative, object oriented, and logic programming along the way. Also on the computer science front, we will look at various abstract computing machines, data structures, and a number of search algorithms as related to solving some problems in recreational mathematics. We will finish the book by building our own <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xx"/>calculator, which will entail lexical analysis using regular expressions, defining the grammar using extended Backus–Naur form (EBNF), and building a recursive descent parser.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec_1"><strong><em>Racket</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Racket features extensive and well-written documentation, which includes <em>Quick: An Introduction to Racket with Pictures</em>, the introductory <em>Racket Guide</em>, and the thorough <em>Racket Reference</em>. Various other toolkits and environments also have separate documentation. Within DrRacket these items can be accessed through the Help menu.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Racket is available for a wide variety of platforms: Windows, Linux, macOS, and Unix. It can be downloaded from the Racket website via the link <a href="https://download.racket-lang.org/"><em>https://download.racket-lang.org/</em></a>. Once downloaded, installation simply entails running the downloaded executable on Windows, <em>.dmg</em> file on macOS, or shell script on Linux. At the time of writing, the current version is 7.8. Examples in the book will run on any version 7.0 or later. They will likely run on earlier versions as well, but since the current version is freely available there is really no need to do so. When the DrRacket environment is first launched, the user will be prompted to select a Racket language variant. The examples in this book all use the first option in the pop-up dialog box (that is, the one that says “The Racket Language”).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The DrRacket window provides a definitions pane (top pane in <a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00fig1">Figure 1</a>) where variables and functions are defined and an interactions pane (bottom pane in <a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00fig1">Figure 1</a>) where Racket code can be interactively executed. Within these panes, help is a single keypress away. Just click on any built-in function name and press F1.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The definitions window contains all the features one expects from a robust interactive development environment (IDE) such as syntax highlighting, variable renaming, and an integrated debugger.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Racket enthusiasts are affectionately known as <em>Racketeers</em> (catchy, eh?). Once you’ve had an opportunity to explore this wonderful environment, don’t be surprised if you become a Racketeer yourself.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec_2"><strong><em>Conventions Used in This Book</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">DrRacket supports a number of programming and learning languages. In this book we focus exclusively on the default Racket language. Thus, unless otherwise stated, all definition files should begin with the line</p>&#13;
<pre>#lang racket</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Code entered in the definitions section will be shown in a framed box as above.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Expressions entered in the interactive pane will be shown prefixed with a right angle bracket <span class="literal">&gt;</span> as shown below. The angle bracket is DrRacket’s input prompt. Outputs will be shown without the angle bracket. To easily differentiate inputs and outputs, inputs will be shown in bold in this book (but they are not bold in the IDE).</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">(+ 1 2 3) ; this is an input, the following is an output</span>&#13;
6</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxii"/>We occasionally make use of some special symbols that DrRacket supports, such as the Greek alphabet (for example, we may use <em>θ</em> as an identifier for an angle). These symbols are listed in Appendix B. The method used to enter these symbols is also given there. If you’re typing the examples in by hand and don’t want to use the special symbols, simply substitute a name of your choosing: for example use <span class="literal">alpha</span> instead of <em>α</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">An example of a program listing entered in the definitions window is shown below.</p>&#13;
<pre>#lang racket&#13;
&#13;
(define (piscis x y r b)&#13;
  (let* ([y (- y r)]&#13;
         [2r (* 2 r)]&#13;
         [yi (sqrt (- (sqr r) (sqr x)))] ; y-intersection&#13;
         [π pi]&#13;
      <span class="ent">➊</span> [<span class="codeitalic1">ϕ</span> (asin (/ yi r))]&#13;
      <span class="ent">➋</span> [<span class="codeitalic1">θ</span> (- π <span class="codeitalic1">ϕ</span>)]&#13;
      <span class="ent">➌</span> [path (new dc-path%)])&#13;
   (send dc set-brush b)&#13;
<span class="ent">➍</span> (send path move-to 0 (- yi))&#13;
<span class="ent">➎</span> (send path arc (- x r)     y 2r 2r  <span class="codeitalic1">θ</span>    (+ π  <span class="codeitalic1">ϕ</span>))&#13;
<span class="ent">➏</span> (send path arc (- (- x) r) y 2r 2r (- <span class="codeitalic1">ϕ</span>) <span class="codeitalic1">ϕ</span>)&#13;
<span class="ent">➐</span> (send dc draw-path path)))</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">We’ll use Wingdings symbols such as <span class="ent">➊</span> to highlight interesting portions of the code.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec_3"><strong><em>Who This Book Is For</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">While no prior knowledge of Racket, Lisp, or Scheme is required, it wouldn’t hurt to have some basic programming knowledge, but this is certainly not required. The mathematical prerequisites will vary. Some topics may be a bit challenging, but nothing more than high school algebra and trigonometry is assumed. A theorem or two may surface, but the treatment will be informal.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec_4"><strong><em>About This Book</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If you’re already familiar with the Racket language, feel free to skip (or perhaps just skim) the first couple of chapters as these just provide an introduction to the language. These early chapters are by no means a comprehensive encyclopedia of Racket functionality. The ambitious reader should consult the excellent Racket Documentation for fuller details. Here is a brief description of each chapter’s content.</p>&#13;
<div class="bq5">&#13;
<p class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch01.xhtml">Chapter 1: Racket Basics</a></strong> Gives the novice Racket user a grounding in some of the basic Racket concepts that will be needed to progress through the rest of the book.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiii"/><strong><a href="ch02.xhtml">Chapter 2: Arithmetic and Other Numerical Paraphernalia</a></strong> Describes Racket’s extensive set of numeric data types: integers, true rational numbers, and complex numbers (to name a few). This chapter will make the reader adept at using these entities in Racket.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch03.xhtml">Chapter 3: Function Fundamentals</a></strong> Introduces Racket’s multi-paradigm programming capability. This chapter introduces the reader to both functional and imperative programming. The final section will look at a few fun programming applications.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch04.xhtml">Chapter 4: Plotting, Drawing, and a Bit of Set Theory</a></strong> Introduces interactive graphics. Most IDEs are textual only; DrRacket has extensive capability for generating graphical output in an interactive environment. This chapter will show you how it’s done.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch05.xhtml">Chapter 5: GUI: Getting Users Interested</a></strong> Shows how to construct mini graphics applications that run in their own window.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch06.xhtml">Chapter 6: Data</a></strong> Explores various ways of handling data in Racket. It will discuss how to read and write data to and from files on your computer. It will also discuss ways to analyze data using statistics and data visualization.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch07.xhtml">Chapter 7: Searching for Answers</a></strong> Examines a number of powerful search algorithms. These algorithms will be used to solve various problems and puzzles in recreational mathematics.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch08.xhtml">Chapter 8: Logic Programming</a></strong> Takes a look at another powerful programming paradigm. Here we explore using Racket’s Prolog-like logic programming library: Racklog.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch09.xhtml">Chapter 9: Computing Machines</a></strong> Takes a quick look at various abstract computing machines. These simple mechanisms are a gateway into some fairly deep concepts in computer science.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><strong><a href="ch10.xhtml">Chapter 10: TRAC: The Racket Algebraic Calculator</a></strong> Leverages skills developed in the previous chapters to build a stand-alone interactive command line calculator.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiv"/></p>&#13;

- en: This is a book for people who like to make things but also enjoy the premise
    of a postapocalypse world where you cannot assume a limitless supply of electricity
    and other resources. As such, book starts with projects for generating electricity
    through solar and pedal-power (using a scavenged car alternator). Once you have
    power, you’ll move on to surveillance and monitoring projects that will help you
    protect your base. Finally, you’ll build communication projects that allow you
    to find other survivors and even send messages to members of your group via silent
    haptic communication.

    attach a wire to a screw terminal, while others require you to be able to solder.
    The detailed primer in [Appendix B](app02.html#app02) will get you started on
    any technical skills that may be new to you. A few of the projects also require
    some basic wood-working skills and tools, but you won’t need anything more fancy
    than a saw, drill, and chisel.

- en: The more technical projects in the book make use of the popular Raspberry Pi
    and Arduino as low power easy to use control modules. See [Chapter 5](ch05.html#ch05)
    for some Raspberry Pi basics and [Appendix C](app03.html#app03) for a primer on
    the Arduino.

    most are also useful even if the zombies don’t take over. Many of the Arduino
    projects can actually be grouped together onto a single Arduino, with a single
    program integrating their different functions.

    to illuminate your base from 12V batteries. Then, you’ll turn an Arduino into
    “[Project 4: Battery Monitor](ch03.html#ch00lev1sec63)” to make sure you don’t

    install around your base to alert you when zombies are about. “[Project 5: Trip
    Wire Alarm](ch04.html#ch00lev1sec71)” is a nice low tech alarm that uses a microswitch
    and car horn, and “[Project 6: PIR Zombie Detector](ch04.html#ch00lev1sec81)”
    is a more high-tech zombie detector that uses a motion sensor.'

    the video for movement detection in Python. “[Project 8: A Wireless Zombie Surveillance
    System](ch05.html#ch00lev1sec102)” helps you make your surveillance system more
    practical by extending your observing range with a low-cost Wi-Fi webcam.'

    shows you how to set up a door with an electro-mechanical door latch so that you
    can unlock it remotely using a wireless option, and “[Project 10: Door Sensor](ch06.html#ch00lev1sec116)”
    will notify you when someone (or something) opens your door.'

    only things you have to worry about when you’re trying to survive. “[Project 11:
    Quiet Fire Alarm](ch07.html#ch00lev1sec121)” shows you how to hack a loud smoke
    detector into a more discreet alarm that’s integrated with Arduino. Then, you
    can use “[Project 12: Temperature Alarm](ch07.html#ch00lev1sec130)” to monitor
    temperatures and set alarms to avoid burst pipes or other disasters.'

    you take all the sensor feedback, detection systems, and so on from previous projects
    and monitor everything on one screen. In “[Project 13: A Raspberry Pi Control
    Center](ch08.html#ch00lev1sec137),” an Arduino monitors for door and zombie movement,
    temperature changes, and battery warnings, while the Raspberry Pi displays a status
    window. You can also add wireless communication between the Raspberry Pi and Arduino
    on the Control Center by following the instructions for “[Project 14: Going Wireless
    with Bluetooth](ch08.html#ch00lev1sec148).” This way, you’ll put more distance
    between you and the dangers you’re monitoring.'

    uses scavenged disposable camera flashes to distract zombies, and “[Project 16:

    to attract fellow survivors with an FM transmitter, hack a low-cost FM radio to
    scan the air waves for messages from fellow survivors with “[Project 18: Arduino
    FM Radio Frequency Hopper](ch10.html#ch00lev1sec186),” and flash out messages

    Arduino](ch11.html#ch00lev1sec206)” allow you to press a button on one device
    and have the other device vibrate (and vice-versa). The project uses an Arduino,
    low cost 2.4GHz RF modules, and a vibration motor.'

    files for the projects, save them to a flash drive, and keep that flash drive
    in your go bag. The Internet will very likely cease to exist during the apocalypse,
    whether because everyone at your ISP becomes a zombie or because the electrical
    grid itself collapses, but if you download these files ahead of time, you’ll be
    one step closer to outlasting the undead.

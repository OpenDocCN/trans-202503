<div class="imagel"><img alt="Image" src="../images/common.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Known in military and government circles as OPSEC, operations security is a process you use to protect your information. Although we’ve discussed certain elements of operations security previously, such as using encryption to protect data, the entire operations security process encompasses much more.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Operations security involves not only putting security measures in place but also identifying what exactly you need to protect and what to protect it against. If you jump directly to implementing protections, you might fail to direct your efforts toward the most critical information. Moreover, when putting security measures in place, you should implement measures that are relative to the value of what you are protecting. If you apply the same level of security to everything, you may be overprotecting some resources that are not of high value and underprotecting resources of much greater value.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_96"/>In this chapter, I’ll discuss the US government’s guidelines for conducting operations security. I’ll then outline the origins of some of these concepts and talk about everyday uses for them as tools for protecting yourself and your organizations.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec1">The Operations Security Process</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The operations security process laid out by the US government has five parts, as shown in <a href="#ch7fig1">Figure 7-1</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch7fig1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/07fig01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-1: The operations security process</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">First, you identify the information that needs protection. You then analyze the threats and vulnerabilities that might impact it and develop methods of mitigating those threats and vulnerabilities. Although the process is relatively simple, it’s effective. Let’s go through these steps one by one.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec1"><em>Identification of Critical Information</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The first and most important step in the operations security process is to identify your most critical information assets. Any given business, individual, military operation, process, or project is bound to have at least a few critical items of information on which everything else depends. For a soft drink company, it might be their secret recipe. For an application vendor, it might be their source code, while for a military operation, it might be an attack timetable. You should be identifying the assets that would cause you the most harm if exposed.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_97"/><em>Analysis of Threats</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The next step is to analyze any threats related to the critical information you identified. Remember from <a href="ch01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> that a threat is something that has the potential to cause you harm. Using your list of critical information, you might evaluate the harm caused if critical information were exposed, as well as who might exploit that exposure. This is the same process many military and government organizations use to classify information and determine who can see it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, if you own a software company, you might identify the proprietary source code of your product as critical information. Exposing this critical information could make the company vulnerable to attackers and competition. Attackers might be able to determine the scheme used to generate license keys and then develop a utility that allows them to pirate your software, costing revenue. Competitors might use exposed source code to copy your software’s proprietary features in their own applications, or they might copy large portions of your application and sell it themselves.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Repeat this step for each item of critical information, for each party that might take advantage of it if it were exposed, and for each use they might make of the information. As you can see, the more information assets you identify as critical, the more involved this step becomes. In some circumstances, you may find that only a limited number of parties can make use of the information and then only in a limited number of ways; in other cases, you may find the exact opposite. For example, a secret chocolate-chip cookie recipe, intended for mass production on an industrial food processing line, would be of use only to another organization operating in this type of industry. The same recipe composed and scaled for home use would be usable by anyone.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec3"><em>Analysis of Vulnerabilities</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that others can exploit to harm you. The third step in operations security is analyzing the vulnerabilities in the protections you’ve put in place to secure your information assets. You’ll do this by looking at how you interact with these assets and what areas an attacker might target to compromise them.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When analyzing the vulnerabilities affecting your source code, you might find that the security controls on the source code aren’t very rigorous and that it’s possible for anyone with access to the operating system or network shares to access, copy, delete, or alter it. This might make it possible for an attacker who has compromised the system to copy, tamper with, or entirely delete the source code. Or the vulnerability might render the files vulnerable to accidental alteration while the system is undergoing maintenance.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You might also find there are no policies in place that regulate where the source code should be stored, whether copies of it should exist on other systems or on backup media, or how it should be protected in general. These issues might create multiple vulnerabilities and could lead to serious security breaches.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_98"/><em>Assessment of Risks</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Next, you decide what issues you need to address in the rest of the operations security process. As discussed in <a href="ch01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, risk occurs when you have a matching threat and vulnerability. In the software source code example, one of the threats was the potential exposure of the application source code. The vulnerabilities were poor controls on access to the source code and a lack of a policy dictating how exactly to control access. These two vulnerabilities could lead to the exposure of your critical information to your competitors or attackers.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Again, you need a matching threat and vulnerability to constitute a risk. If the confidentiality of your source code wasn’t a goal—for instance, if you were creating an open source project and the source code were freely available to the public—you wouldn’t have a risk. Likewise, if your source code were subject to stringent security requirements that made it nearly impossible to release in an unauthorized manner, you wouldn’t have a risk, either, as the vulnerability would not be present.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec5"><em>Application of Countermeasures</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Once you’ve discovered risks to your critical information, you can put measures in place to mitigate them. In operations security, these are called <em>countermeasures</em>. As discussed, to constitute a risk, you need a matching set of threats and vulnerabilities. When you construct a countermeasure for a risk, you need to mitigate either the threat or the vulnerability at the bare minimum.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the source code example, the threat was that your source code might be exposed to your competitors or attackers, and the vulnerability was the poor set of security controls you had in place to protect it. In this instance, there is not much that you can do to protect yourself from the threat itself without changing the nature of your application entirely, so you can’t mitigate the threat. You can, however, put measures in place to mitigate the vulnerability.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, to mitigate this vulnerability, you can institute stronger measures to control access to the code and establish a set of rules for how to control access. Once you break the threat/vulnerability pair like this, you’ll no longer have a serious risk.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It’s important to note that this is an <em>iterative</em> process, and you’ll likely need to repeat the cycle more than once to fully mitigate any issues. Each time you go through the cycle, you take into account the knowledge and experience you gained from your previous mitigation efforts, allowing you to adjust your solution for an even greater level of security. You’ll also need to revisit this process when your environment changes and new factors arise.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you’re familiar with risk management, you might have noticed that the operations security cycle lacks a step that evaluates the effectiveness of the countermeasures. I believe this step is implied throughout the entire operations security process. However, the process is certainly not set in stone, and you can include this step if you see the benefits of doing so.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_99"/>Laws of Operations Security</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Kurt Haase, a former employee of the Nevada Operations Office of the Department of Energy, distilled the operations security process into three rules, called the <em>laws of OPSEC</em>. These laws are another way of thinking about the cycle discussed earlier, and while not necessarily the most <em>important</em> parts of the process, they do serve to highlight some of operation security’s main concepts.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec6"><em>First Law: Know the Threats</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The first law of operations security is “If you don’t know the threat, how do you know what to protect?”<a href="notes.xhtml#ch07fn1" id="kch07fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> In other words, you need to be aware of both the actual and potential threats facing your critical data. This law maps directly to the second step in the operations security process.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Ultimately, as discussed earlier, each piece of information could be susceptible to its own threat. Threats might even depend on your location. This is particularly true when it comes to cloud-based services. For example, even if you’ve enumerated all the threats facing your critical data for a location, you might encounter new threats if you replicate that data across multiple storage areas, in multiple countries. That’s because different parties may have easier access in one area, or the relevant laws may differ significantly from one location to another.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec7"><em>Second Law: Know What to Protect</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">“If you don’t know what to protect, how do you know you are protecting it?”<a href="notes.xhtml#ch07fn2" id="kch07fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> This law of operations security points to the need to evaluate your information assets and determine what exactly you might consider to be your critical information. This second law maps to the first step in the operations security process.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Most government environments mandate the identification and classification of information. Each item of information—perhaps a document or file—is assigned a label, like <em>classified</em> or <em>top secret</em>, that identifies the sensitivity of its contents. Such labeling makes the task of identifying your critical information considerably easier, but unfortunately, few people outside the government use that system.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Some organizations in the business world might have information classification policies, but, in my experience, they usually implement such labeling sporadically. A few civilian industries, such as those that deal with data that has federally mandated requirements for protection, like financial or medical data, do classify information, but these are the exceptions rather than the rule.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec8"><em>Third Law: Protect the Information</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The third and last law of operations security is “If you are not protecting [the information], … THE DRAGON WINS!”<a href="notes.xhtml#ch07fn3" id="kch07fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> This law addresses the necessity of the operations security process overall. If you don’t take steps <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_100"/>to protect your information from the dragon (your adversaries or competitors), they win by default.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Cases of the “dragon” winning are unfortunately common. Security breaches show up constantly in the news and on websites that track breaches, such as Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (<em><a href="https://www.privacyrights.org/">https://www.privacyrights.org/</a></em>). In many cases, a breach was the result of simple carelessness and noncompliance with the most basic security measures.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This is true for the breach of the California-based email marketing company SaverSpy discovered by a security researcher in September 2018. The breach contained more than 43GB of user data, including the names, email addresses, physical addresses, and gender of more than 10 million Yahoo users.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch07fn4" id="kch07fn4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I’d like to think that hackers broke into the system and stole this information in the dark of night. But in fact, the researcher discovered the data while sifting through compromised servers on Shodan,<a href="notes.xhtml#ch07fn5" id="kch07fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> a search engine; it turned out the servers containing this data were wide open and unprotected on the internet. To add insult to injury, the database also contained a table with a ransom note from an attacker who had found the exposed servers earlier.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The operations security process would have quickly identified critical data sets such as these, giving you a much better chance of avoiding such a situation. The security measures needed to prevent breaches are neither complex nor expensive and can save you a great deal of reputational and financial damage in the long run.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec3">Operations Security in Our Personal Lives</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The operations security process can be useful not only in both business and government but also in our personal lives. You may not consciously work through all the parts of the operations security cycle to protect your personal data, but you still use some of the methods discussed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, if you’re going on vacation for several weeks and leaving behind an empty house, you might take steps to ensure some level of security while you’re gone. You might start by making the following list of indicators that the house is unoccupied and vulnerable:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">No lights on at night</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">No noise coming from the house</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Newspapers building up in the driveway</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Mail building up in the mailbox</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">No car in the driveway</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">No people coming and going</p></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="indent">You might then take steps to ensure that you don’t show your vulnerabilities so obviously to burglars or vandals. For example, you could set timers on your lights so that they turn on and off at various times throughout the house. You may also set a timer on the television or radio so that you can <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_101"/>generate noise that makes it seem like someone is home. To solve the problem of mail and newspapers stacking up, you can suspend their delivery while you’re gone. To make the house appear occupied, you might also have a friend drop by every few days to water the plants and perhaps move a car in and out of the garage every now and then.</p>&#13;
<div class="sidebar">&#13;
<p class="sidebart"><strong>OPERATIONS SECURITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In the age of social networking tools, you see personal operations security violations on a disturbingly regular basis. Many of these tools are now equipped with location awareness functionality that allows our computers and portable devices to report our physical locations when we update our statuses.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Additionally, people often post that they’re going to lunch, leaving on vacation, and so on. In both instances, we’ve given the general public a very clear signal of when we might not be home or when we might be found at a particular location—a bad practice from an operational security standpoint.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Although you won’t enforce these OPSEC measures to your personal data as strictly as the US government, the process is the same. When it comes to your logical assets, taking these approaches is especially important.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Your personal information travels through a staggering number of computer systems and networks. Although you might take steps to mitigate security threats by being careful about where and how you share your personal information over the internet, or perhaps by shredding mail that contains sensitive information before throwing it away, you’re unfortunately not in control of all the ways your personal information might be exposed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As you saw with the SaverSpy breach earlier in this chapter, you can’t always trust organizations to handle your information carefully. That said, if you make plans to secure your personal data before breaches occur, you can at least mitigate the issue to a certain extent. For instance, you can put monitoring services in place to watch your credit reports, and you can file fraud reports with these same agencies in the case of a breach. You can also watch your financial accounts carefully. Although such steps might not be complex or terribly difficult to carry out, they can make a big difference if implemented before the problem has occurred.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec4">Origins of Operations Security</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Although the operations security process as implemented in the US government may be a recent idea, its foundational concepts are ancient. You can point to nearly any military or large commercial organization in any period in history and find the principles of operations security present. In this section, I’ll cover a few examples that were important to the development of modern operations security.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec9"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_102"/><em>Sun Tzu</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Sun Tzu was a Chinese military general who lived in the sixth century <small>BCE</small>. For some, Sun Tzu’s work <em>The Art of War</em> is a kind of bible for conducting military operations. <em>The Art of War</em> has spawned countless spin-offs, many of which apply the principles it preaches to a variety of situations, including information security. The text documents some of the earliest examples of operations security principles. Let’s look at just a couple of these.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The first passage is, “If I am able to determine the enemy’s dispositions while at the same time I conceal my own, then I can concentrate and he must divide.” <a href="notes.xhtml#ch07fn6" id="kch07fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> This is a simple admonition to discover information held by our opponents while protecting our own.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The second passage is, “(When) making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.” <a href="notes.xhtml#ch07fn7" id="kch07fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> Here, Sun Tzu is saying we should conduct our strategic planning in an area that is difficult for our opponents to observe—in this case, the highest point we can find. Again, he recommends protecting our planning activities so that they don’t leak to those that might oppose our efforts.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Although written a long time ago, both these passages agree closely with the laws of operations security that we discussed earlier in the chapter—namely, know the threats, know what to protect, and then protect it.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec10"><em>George Washington</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">George Washington, the first president of the United States, was an astute and skilled military commander who promoted good operational security practices. He is known in the operations security community for having said, “Even minutiae should have a place in our collection, for things of a seemingly trifling nature, when enjoined with others of a more serious cast, may lead to valuable conclusion,”<a href="notes.xhtml#ch07fn8" id="kch07fn8"><sup>8</sup></a> which means that even small items of information, which are worthless individually, can be of great value in combination.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A modern example of this idea is the three main items of information that constitute an identity: a name, an address, and a Social Security number. Individually, these items are completely useless. You could take any one of them in isolation and put it up on a billboard for the world to see and not be any worse for having done so. In combination, however, these three items are sufficient for an attacker to steal your identity and use it for all manners of fraudulent activities.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Washington is also quoted as having said, “For upon Secrecy, Success depends in most Enterprizes of the kind, and for want of it, they are generally defeated.”<a href="notes.xhtml#ch07fn9" id="kch07fn9"><sup>9</sup></a> In this case, he was referring to an intelligence gathering program and the need to keep its activities secret. He is often considered to have been very well informed on intelligence issues and is credited with maintaining an extensive organization to execute such activities, long before any such formal capabilities existed.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec11"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_103"/><em>Vietnam War</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">During the Vietnam War, the United States realized that information regarding troop movements, operations, and other military activities was being leaked to the enemy. Clearly, in most environments, military or otherwise, having our opponents gain knowledge of our activities is a bad thing, particularly when lives may be at stake. To stop the leak, authorities conducted a study, code-named Purple Dragon,<a href="notes.xhtml#ch07fn10" id="kch07fn10"><sup>10</sup></a> to discover its cause.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Ultimately, the study reached two main conclusions: first, in that environment, eavesdroppers and spies abounded, and second, the military needed a survey to reveal the extent of the information loss. The survey asked questions about the information itself and how vulnerable the information was. The team conducting these surveys and analyses coined the term <em>operations security</em> and its acronym <em>OPSEC</em>. Additionally, they saw the need for an operations security group to serve as a body that would espouse the principles of operations security to the different organizations within the government and work with them to get them established.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec12"><em>Business</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In the late 1970s and early 1980s, some of the operations security concepts used in military and government began to take root in the commercial world. Industrial espionage—spying on business competition to gain a competitive advantage—is an old practice, but as the concept became more structured in the military world, it became more structured in the business world as well. In 1980, Michael E. Porter, a professor at Harvard Business School, published a book titled <em>Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors</em>. This text, now nearing its 60th printing, set the groundwork for what we now call competitive intelligence.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Competitive intelligence</em> is generally defined as conducting intelligence gathering and analysis to support business decisions. The counterpart of competitive intelligence, <em>competitive counterintelligence</em>, includes the operations security principles that were laid out by the government only a few years previously and is an active part of conducting business to this day. You can see these principles at work in many large corporations, as well as in groups such as the Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Professionals (SCIP)<a href="notes.xhtml#ch07fn11" id="kch07fn11"><sup>11</sup></a> professional organization and the Ecole de Guerre Economique (or Economic Warfare School), located in Paris.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec13"><em>Interagency OPSEC Support Staff</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">After the end of the Vietnam War, the group that conducted Purple Dragon and developed the government OPSEC principles tried to get support for an organization that would work with the various government agencies on operations security. They had little success in interesting the military institutions and were unable to gain official support from the US National Security Agency. Fortunately, through the efforts of the US Department of Energy and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_104"/>the US General Services Administration, they garnered sufficient backing to move forward. At this point, they drafted a document to put in front of then-first-term-President Ronald Reagan.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">These efforts were delayed due to Reagan’s reelection campaign, but shortly afterward, in 1988, he signed the Interagency OPSEC Support Staff (IOSS) into being with the National Decision Security Directive 298.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch07fn12" id="kch07fn12"><sup>12</sup></a> Today, the IOSS is responsible for a wide variety of OPSEC awareness and training efforts, such as the Naval Operations Security poster shown in <a href="#ch7fig2">Figure 7-2</a>.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch07fn13" id="kch07fn13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-2: OPSEC awareness poster</em></p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec5">Summary</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The origins of operational security stretches far back into recorded history. You can find such principles espoused in the writings of Sun Tzu in the sixth century <small>BCE</small>, in the words of George Washington, in writings from the business community, and in the US government’s methodologies. Although formalized operations security processes are a much more recent creation, the principles on which they are founded are ancient indeed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The operations security process consists of five major steps. First, you start by identifying your most critical information so that you know what you need to protect. You then analyze your situation to determine what threats and vulnerabilities exist in your environment. Once you know your threats and vulnerabilities, you can attempt to determine what risks you might face. You have a risk whenever your threats and your vulnerabilities match. When you know the risks, you can plan countermeasures to mitigate your risks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_105"/>To summarize this process, you can also look to the laws of OPSEC penned by Kurt Haase. His three laws cover some of the high points of the process you might want to internalize.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You also use the operations security principles used in business and in government in your personal life, even though you may not do so in a formal manner. It’s important to identify your critical information and plan measures to protect it, especially with the sheer volume of personal information shared through systems and networks.</p>&#13;

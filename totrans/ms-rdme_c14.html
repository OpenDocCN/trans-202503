			</header>
			<p class="BodyFirst"><span class="DropCap">A</span> software engineer’s career arc is long. <em>The Missing README</em> will take you to the end of the beginning of your journey. What lies beyond is a lifetime of learning, technical leadership, and maybe even management or entrepreneurship. Regardless of your path, you must continue to grow.</p>
			<p>While previous chapters focused on specific engineering activities, we’ll zoom out in this chapter to look at what lies ahead, give career advice, and share some closing thoughts.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c14-0001">To Senior and Beyond</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Career ladders</em> list job title hierarchies and describe expectations at each level. Together, the titles in a ladder form a career progression at a company. The number of levels vary from company to company, but there are usually two transitions that indicate significant shifts in seniority: from <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_250" title="250"/>junior or software engineer to senior engineer, and from senior to staff or principal engineer.</p>
			<p>In Chapter 1, we enumerated the technical, execution, communication, and leadership skills expected of a senior engineer. Importantly, a senior engineer’s scope and focus also change. Junior engineers implement features and complete tasks. Senior engineers deal with more uncertainty and ambiguity; they help determine what to work on, tackle larger or more critical projects, and need less direction.</p>
			<p>Staff engineers take on even broader responsibilities that extend beyond their team. They contribute to engineering strategy, quarterly planning, system architecture, and run engineering processes and policies. Staff engineers still code (and they code a lot), but to get to this level, just being a good coder isn’t enough: you have to understand the big picture and make decisions with far-reaching consequences.</p>
			<p>
				Career ladders usually split into management and “individual contributor” tracks at the staff level. Advancing in your career does not <em>require</em> managing people, and management is a wholly different skillset. If you’re considering management, read Camille Fournier’s book <em>The Manager’s Path</em> (O’Reilly Media, 2017) to get a glimpse of what’s in store.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c14-0002">Career Advice</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Becoming a senior or staff engineer takes time and persistence, but you can help yourself by taking responsibility for your career growth. Cultivate a T-shaped skillset, participate in engineering programs, engage in the promotion process, don’t change jobs too frequently, and pace yourself.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c14-0001">Be T-Shaped</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Software engineering has many specialties: frontend, backend, operations, data warehousing, machine learning, and so on. “T-shaped” engineers work effectively in most areas and are experts in at least one.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_251" title="251"/>We first encountered the concept of T-shaped people in Valve’s <em>Handbook for New Employees</em> (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/publications/">https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/publications/</a>). The handbook describes T-shaped people as:</p>
			<blockquote class="review trade">
				<p class="Blockquote">. . . people who are both generalists (highly skilled at a broad set of valuable things—the top of the T) and also experts (among the best in their field within a narrow discipline—the vertical leg of the T).</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Being a T-shaped engineer will keep you from making decisions in a vacuum, allow you to make changes that touch multiple codebases, and simplify troubleshooting. You’ll be able to solve hard problems that stump others by combining your expertise with the ability to understand disparate systems.</p>
			<p>Start by building your base. Base-building will expose you to different subfields so you can find your passion. Look for projects that involve other teams such as data science, operations, frontend, and so on. Work with other teams’ code and ask if it’s okay to contribute patches or pair program as changes are made. Delve deeper to acquire depth as you encounter subjects and problems that pique your interest.</p>
			<p>Keep the breadth/depth paradigm in mind with your team, too. Everyone has their own expertise and gaps. Just because your teammate doesn’t know what a monad is doesn’t mean that they aren’t good at something else. Likewise, don’t be too hard on yourself if you find you’re the novice in a conversation; you will have other areas of comparative strength.</p>
			<p>A good team will have a solid mix of T-shaped people. Product development teams are likely to have varied areas of depth among teammates, while infrastructure teams are more likely to have a shared expertise.</p>
			<p>
				As companies grow, they increasingly hire specialists for each area, which will push everyone that’s already at the company to also specialize (since generalists will find themselves with a smaller and smaller area to operate). This process might drive you toward specialization or, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_252" title="252"/>if you already have a T-shaped skillset, help you gracefully adapt as you get to lean more on your specialty. You might even find that some of the specialists who join the company don’t have your breadth (they’re not T-shaped), so you can help them understand their surroundings and be more effective.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c14-0002">Participate in Engineering Programs</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Many companies have engineering programs that encourage learning, development, and a shared culture. Hiring, interviewing, brown bags, conferences, meetups, reading groups, open source projects, and apprenticeship and mentoring programs are all opportunities to get involved.</p>
			<p>Seek out and join the programs that most interest you. You can participate by attending or by leading. If you find your company doesn’t have well-organized engineering programs, create one! Discuss your ideas with management and find passionate teammates that want to help.</p>
			<p>Participating in and contributing to engineering programs will help your career. You’ll build relationships, increase your visibility across the organization, learn new skills, and help influence company culture.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c14-0003">Steer Your Promotion</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Ideally, your manager would promote you at the exact right and fair time. But the world is rarely ideal, so you’ll probably need to steer your promotion. Learn the promotion process, make sure your work is valuable and visible, and speak up when you think you’re nearing the next level.</p>
			<p>To get promoted, you’ll need to know how you’re evaluated and what the promotion process looks like. Find your company’s career ladder to determine the skills you need for the next level. Talk with your manager about the promotion process. Are promotions done annually? Who evaluates potential promotions? Do you need a mentor, sponsor, or promotion packet?</p>
			<p>
				Once you understand the evaluation criteria and promotion process, do a self-assessment and get feedback from others. Write a brief <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_253" title="253"/>document that lists your achievements for each category of the career ladder. Look for areas that you need to develop. Solicit feedback from your manager, peers, and mentors. Tell people why you are asking for feedback so they know you aren’t just looking for reassurance. Dig into specifics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>“If you compare my design docs to those by some Level 3 engineers, are there differences that are apparent?”</li>
				<li>
					“You said I write good tests. Which tests that I wrote do you find good? What’s an example of less-good tests? Who at our company writes <em>great</em> tests? How is what I do different from what they do?”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you get feedback you disagree with, try to understand where it’s coming from. Others might have an incomplete view of your work, or your work might not be perceived as valuable. Perhaps team shuffling left you without a completed project to point to. Or maybe your evaluation of your own work is a bit off and you need to recalibrate. Address feedback misalignment with candid conversations with your manager.</p>
			<p>After you self-assess and get feedback, review everything with your manager and work out a plan to fill in gaps. Expect suggestions about engineering programs to join or projects and practices that exercise certain skills.</p>
			<p>People are often disappointed when they expect a promotion for the wrong reasons. A promising but unfinished project isn’t enough; managers want to see results. Technical skills are necessary but not sufficient: you must work well with others, contribute to team goals, and help the organization. A promotion isn’t a function of time: whether you are in your job for one year or five, impact is what matters. When you hit the next level, expect to be there for three to six months before promotion so you prove you can consistently meet the bar.</p>
			<p>
				When it comes to promotion conversations, timing matters. Start these conversations <em>before</em> you think you are ready for a promotion—about when you’ve hit the halfway point. Engaging early gives you and your manager time to align and address gaps. If you wait until you <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_254" title="254"/>already think you deserve a promotion, but your manager doesn’t agree, the conversation becomes about resolving a conflict rather than coming up with a plan.</p>
			<p>
				Finally, be aware that career ladders reflect common molds that not everyone fits into. Staff work requires broad influence and “glue work” (coordination, process improvements, documentation, communication, and so on). At the senior level and below, requirements are often described more in terms of pure coding ability. This creates a problem for junior engineers who take on essential noncoding work that does not have a Git commit attached to it. Such engineers spend less time coding, so their promotions get delayed, or they get pushed to a different role such as project management. Tanya Reilly’s talk and blog post (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://noidea.dog/glue/">https://noidea.dog/glue/</a>) suggests that you <em>stop doing glue work</em>—even if it hurts the team in the short term—if your manager does not see your contributions as a path to promotion. This is a tough pill to swallow, and it may seem unfair, but the onus for making things fair here is on management, not on you.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c14-0004">Change Jobs Carefully</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Changing jobs can expand your skillset and your network, but frequent job changes can stunt your growth and look bad to hiring managers. Don’t change jobs without a good reason.</p>
			<p>Senior engineers leverage past experience to guide decisions. If you constantly switch jobs, you’ll never see how your decisions play out over the long term, which will stunt the development of the intuition you need as a senior engineer. Hiring managers see a series of short stints on a résumé as a red flag: they worry that you will leave as soon as the going gets tough and the initial “honeymoon” period is over.</p>
			<p>
				FOMO—fear of missing out—isn’t a good reason to switch jobs. From the outside, other companies appear to have newer technology, cooler problems, and none of the complications of your current company. The grass will always look greener on the other side, but all companies have <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_255" title="255"/>problems. If you are worried about missing out, expose yourself to new ideas at meetups and conferences. Employers will often pay for career development or even schooling. Open source and side projects are also a good way to stay fresh if your schedule allows it. You might also consider staying at the same company but switching teams.</p>
			<p>There are, of course, good reasons to change jobs even after a short tenure. Some companies or teams are a bad fit, and it’s better to get out of a bad situation quickly rather than letting it drag on. Exceptional opportunities don’t arrive on a convenient schedule, and you should be open to them when they appear. There’s also value in exposing yourself to different technology stacks, coworkers, and engineering organizations. And engineering salaries have been growing rapidly; your company might not be awarding raises as fast as the market is rising. Sadly, it is often easier to catch up to the market by switching jobs. But stick with your job if you’re still properly compensated, growing, and learning. There is great value in seeing teams, companies, and software evolve over time.</p>
			<p>Conversely, don’t stay too long. Job ossification—becoming stagnant—is a legitimate reason to change things up. Longtime engineers at a company naturally become historians who educate engineers about how things work, who knows what, and why things were done the way they were. Such knowledge is valuable—it’s even part of being a staff engineer—but it can stunt your growth if your value comes more from past work than current contributions. Changing companies and finding yourself in a new environment can kickstart your growth.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c14-0005">Pace Yourself</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The software field isn’t stress free. Work can be hectic, competition is fierce, technology evolves quickly, and there’s always more to learn. It might feel like there’s too much happening too fast. New engineers often react by pushing harder and working longer hours, but that’s a recipe for burnout. Take breaks to disconnect, and don’t overwork yourself.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_256" title="256"/>Engineers sometimes glorify 14-hour workdays and sleeping bags under the desk, but marathon coding sessions and lack of sleep will damage your code, your health, and your relationships. Researchers studying the effect of sleep on developer performance found that “a single night of sleep deprivation leads to a reduction of 50% in the quality of the implementations” (“Need for Sleep: The Impact of a Night of Sleep Deprivation on Novice Developers’ Performance,” <em>IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</em>, 2020). Yes, you’ll occasionally have long hours, but don’t let it become a habit or, worse, your identity. Long hours and poor sleep aren’t sustainable; the debt comes due.</p>
			<p>Even with a healthy work schedule, the monthly grind of work can burn you out. Take vacations and sabbaticals to disconnect. Some engineers prefer large vacations at the end of the year, while others take quarterly vacations to stave off fatigue. Find what works for you, but don’t let vacation days go to waste. Most companies cap the maximum number of vacation days you can accrue. Some companies also offer sabbaticals, typically one-to-three-month extended breaks, to explore and refresh.</p>
			<p>Your career is a marathon, not a sprint; you have decades ahead of you. Pace yourself and enjoy the journey!</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c14-0003">Closing Thoughts</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Software engineering is a great career filled with fascinating challenges. You can contribute to any industry, from science to farming, health, entertainment, or even space exploration. Your work can improve billions of lives. Work with people you like on problems you’re passionate about, and you can accomplish great things. We’re rooting for you. Good luck.</p>

<div class="image1"><img src="graphics/common01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, you learned how to create a variable and change its value. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to use math in Python to generate any block you want and quickly build complex structures in your Minecraft world. You’ll even give yourself superpowers to make the player super jump!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec01"><strong><span class="blue">EXPRESSIONS AND STATEMENTS</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">When you’re having a conversation with someone, you want them to understand what you’re telling them. You use short phrases, such as “three diamonds” or “behind a tree,” to give information to the person you’re talking to. However, the phrases don’t make sense on their own unless they’re combined into sentences, such as “I found three diamonds behind a tree.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"/>Python programming has concepts similar to phrases and sentences, which are called expressions and statements.</p>
<p class="indent">You can combine values, variables, and operators to create small pieces of code called <em>expressions</em>, like <code>2 + 2</code>. Expressions can be combined into <em>statements</em>, which you learned about in <a href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>. Statements are single lines or short blocks of code that do something in a program, such as <code>zombies = 2 + 2</code>. In this example, <code>2 + 2</code> is an expression and is part of the statement <code>zombies = 2 + 2</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">For longer programs that use a text editor instead of the Python shell, be sure to write entire statements. For example, the Python shell and a program written in a text editor will treat the expression <code>2 + 2</code> entirely differently. When you’re using the Python shell in IDLE, Python will output <code>4</code> as the result of <code>2 + 2</code>, as shown here:</p>
<pre><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> 2 + 2<br/><span class="blue1">4</span></pre>
<p class="indent">However, when you’re using a text editor, Python won’t do anything with the expression because it’s not part of a complete statement. To turn this expression into a complete statement, you could assign its value to a variable, like this:</p>
<pre>zombies = 2 + 2</pre>
<p class="indent">Then print that variable to see its value:</p>
<pre><span class="rose">print</span>(zombies)</pre>
<p class="indent">When you run this code, it will print <code>4</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, when writing programs in the text editor, it’s very important that you use full statements, not just expressions.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec02"><strong><span class="blue">OPERATORS</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In math, <em>operators</em> are used to alter and combine numbers. For example, the addition operator lets you add two (or more) numbers, and the subtraction operator is used to subtract one number from another.</p>
<p class="indent">Python uses all the basic math operators that you already know—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—as well as more advanced operators, like exponents. Let’s start with addition.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec01"><strong><span class="blue">ADDITION</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">In Python, addition looks like you would normally write it using the plus sign (<code>+</code>). For example, if you have two flowers and you pick two more, you could describe that with a statement using addition:</p>
<pre><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> flowers = 2 + 2</pre>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"/>Python works out the result of the expression on the right side of the equal sign and then assigns it to the variable on the left. In this case, the result of the expression on the right is <code>4</code>. For the rest of the time that this particular code is in use, the variable <code>flowers</code> will have a value of <code>4</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use addition in Minecraft to build things in the blink of an eye. Are you ready for your next mission? Let’s get started!</p>
<h4 class="h4a" id="ch03lev2sec02"><strong>MISSION #5: STACK BLOCKS</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">You can use the <code>setBlock()</code> function to create and place a block in Minecraft. Just like <code>setPos()</code> and <code>setTilePos()</code>, <code>setBlock()</code> takes x-, y-, and z-coordinates as arguments, but it also needs a fourth value: the block type. This value identifies the kind of block you want to place in the game.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether it’s grass, lava, melon, or any other block, each type is represented by a specific integer. For example, grass is <code>2</code>, empty air is <code>0</code>, water is <code>8</code>, and melon is <code>103</code>. For a full list of blocks and their integer values, see “<a href="app02.html#app02">Block ID Cheat Sheet</a>” on <a href="app01.html#page_283">page 283</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">To use <code>setBlock()</code>, pass values for the x-, y-, and z-coordinates and the integer representing the block type to the function, separated by commas. For example, let’s place a melon block (type 103) at coordinates (6, 5, 28):</p>
<pre><span class="orange">from</span> mcpi.minecraft <span class="orange">import</span> Minecraft<br/>mc = Minecraft.create()<br/>mc.setBlock(6, 5, 28, 103)</pre>
<p class="indent">After the first two familiar lines that you’ll see in all Minecraft Python programs, just call <code>setBlock()</code> with all the values you want to use. You can also use variables instead of numbers to get the same effect, as shown in <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex1">Listing 3-1</a>.</p>
<p class="sidenote"><span class="blue"><em>blockStack.py</em></span></p>
<pre><span class="orange">from</span> mcpi.minecraft <span class="orange">import</span> Minecraft<br/>mc = Minecraft.create()<br/>x = 6<br/>y = 5<br/>z = 28<br/>blockType = 103<br/>mc.setBlock(x, y, z, blockType)</pre>
<p class="examplet"><a id="ch3ex1"/><em>Listing 3-1: A program to create a melon block</em></p>
<p class="indent">First, create variables to represent the block coordinates (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>) and type (<code>blockType</code>). Then, pass all the variables to the <code>setBlock()</code> function, and the Minecraft Python API works its magic. Now you can use those variables again anywhere in your program, and if you decide to change their values later, you only have to change them in one place.</p>
<p class="indent">When you combine this code with math operators, you can do some pretty cool things. Let’s create a stack of blocks.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_50"/>Create a new folder called <em>math</em> within the <em>Minecraft Python</em> folder. Open IDLE and create a blank program using IDLE’s text editor. Save this file as <em>blockStack.py</em> in the <em>math</em> folder. Copy the code from <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex1">Listing 3-1</a> into your editor and add the two lines from <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex2">Listing 3-2</a> to stack another melon block on top of the one you just set.</p>
<p class="sidenote"><span class="blue"><em>blockStack.py</em></span></p>
<pre><span class="ent">➊</span> y = y + 1<br/><span class="ent">➋</span> mc.setBlock(x, y, z, blockType)</pre>
<p class="examplet"><a id="ch3ex2"/><em>Listing 3-2: Extra code to stack a second melon block on top of the first melon</em></p>
<p class="indent">You’re adding 1 to the value of <code>y</code> <span class="ent">➊</span>, and you’re using the <code>setBlock()</code> function to create another new block <span class="ent">➋</span>. By increasing the value of <code>y</code> by 1, the second block is placed higher on the y-axis than the first block, so the second block is stacked on top of the first one.</p>
<p class="indent">From here, your mission is to add two more blocks to the stack. Try modifying your <em>blockStack.py</em> program so it stacks four blocks instead of two! When you run your program, a stack of four melon blocks should appear, as shown in <a href="ch03.html#ch3fig1">Figure 3-1</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="graphics/f03-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>

<h4 class="h4a" id="ch03lev2sec03"><strong>MISSION #6: SUPER JUMP</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, you learned how to change the player’s location. Let’s take that skill one step further and send the player high into the air using the power of addition. First, find out where the player is by calling <code>getTilePos()</code>, as shown in <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex3">Listing 3-3</a>.</p>
<p class="sidenote"><span class="blue"><em>superJump.py</em></span></p>
<pre><span class="orange">from</span> mcpi.minecraft <span class="orange">import</span> Minecraft<br/>mc = Minecraft.create()<br/><br/>position = mc.player.getTilePos()<br/>x = position.x<br/>y = position.y<br/>z = position.z</pre>
<p class="examplet"><a id="ch3ex3"/><em>Listing 3-3: Code to find the player’s position</em></p>
<p class="indent">The dot between the <code>position</code> variable and the <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> is called <em>dot notation</em>. Dot notation is used by certain variables and functions, such as all of the functions you use in the Minecraft Python API (for example, <code>mc.setTilePos()</code>). You’ll learn more about dot notation in <a href="ch11.html#ch11">Chapters 11</a> and <a href="ch12.html#ch12">12</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Once you have the player’s position, you can set the <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> variables to the player’s current coordinates, which are represented by <code>position.x</code>, <code>position.y</code>, and <code>position.z</code>. You can then teleport the player anywhere you want in relation to the current coordinates, as shown in <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex4">Listing 3-4</a>.</p>
<p class="sidenote"><span class="blue"><em>superJump.py</em></span></p>
<pre>x = x + 5<br/>mc.player.setTilePos(x, y, z)</pre>
<p class="examplet"><a id="ch3ex4"/><em>Listing 3-4: Code to move the player’s x position up by 5 blocks</em></p>
<p class="indent">Here, I’ve transported the player 5 blocks along the x-axis, but this isn’t that special: you can move the player around horizontally any time you want in Minecraft. Let’s give the player a super jump instead!</p>
<p class="indent">Your mission is to make the player jump 10 blocks into the air above their current position. You should be able to do this using the code in <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex3">Listings 3-3</a> and <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex4">3-4</a> but with some slight differences. Copy the code in <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex3">Listings 3-3</a> and <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex4">3-4</a> into IDLE, save it as <em>superJump.py</em>, and change the <code>y</code> variable in a similar way to how I changed the <code>x</code> variable. When you run the program, the player should jump into the air, as in <a href="ch03.html#ch3fig2">Figure 3-2</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_52"/><img src="graphics/f03-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch3fig2"/><em>Figure 3-2: Here’s the super jump in action!</em></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec04"><strong><span class="blue">SUBTRACTION</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Python handles subtraction similarly to how it handles addition. Let’s say you’re out exploring a cave, a spider attacks you, and you lose some health:</p>
<pre>health = 20<br/>health = health - 2</pre>
<p class="indent">The value of <code>health</code> in the statement is now <code>18</code>. Just as with the addition operation, Python works out the result of the operation on the right of the equal sign and sets the variable to that value.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s have some fun with subtraction in Minecraft!</p>
<h4 class="h4a" id="ch03lev2sec05"><strong>MISSION #7: CHANGE THE BLOCKS UNDER YOU</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Have you ever wanted to set a trap for someone in Minecraft? Imagine the ground beneath the player suddenly changing to lava when they least expect it. You can use Python to make your wish come true. Using subtraction, you can place blocks below the player’s current position. In fact, it takes only a few lines of code to place any block you want directly below the player!</p>
<p class="indent">In this mission, you’ll change the block underneath the player to lava using <code>getTilePos()</code> and <code>setBlock()</code>. But this is a dangerous mission, so be careful when testing it: if you don’t move the player to a new position quickly enough, they might fall into the lava!</p>
<p class="indent">The program in <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex5">Listing 3-5</a> creates a block at the player’s current position. Copy this code into a new file in IDLE and save it as <em>blockBelow.py</em>. Then, using your knowledge of the subtraction operator, change the code so it places a lava block directly below the player’s feet, as shown in <a href="ch03.html#ch3fig3">Figure 3-3</a>.</p>
<p class="sidenote"><a id="page_53"/><span class="blue"><em>blockBelow.py</em></span></p>
<pre><span class="orange">from</span> mcpi.minecraft <span class="orange">import</span> Minecraft<br/>mc = Minecraft.create()<br/>pos = mc.player.getTilePos()<br/>x = pos.x<br/>y = pos.y<br/>z = pos.z<br/>blockType = 10<br/>mc.setBlock(x, y, z, blockType)</pre>
<p class="examplet"><a id="ch3ex5"/><em>Listing 3-5: This code places a block at the player’s current location.</em></p>
<p class="indent">Notice that I’ve named the variable that stores the player’s position <code>pos</code>. I chose this name because I use this variable a lot, it’s easy to understand what the name means, and it’s shorter and faster to type than <code>position</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">The y-coordinate determines how high or low a block is. Your mission is to figure out how to change the <code>y</code> variable to place a block below the player.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="graphics/f03-03.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch3fig3"/><em>Figure 3-3: After the block below me changed, I fell into the lava.</em></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart"><strong>BONUS OBJECTIVE: BLOCKS ALL AROUND YOU</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">You’ve learned how to place blocks below the player. Can you work out how to place a block above the player? Once you’ve figured out how to do this, try to place several blocks around the player at once. Then you’ll be able to start creating buildings around the player!</p>
<p class="indent">Try combining this program with the one from <a href="ch03.html#ch03lev2sec03">Mission #6</a> (<a href="ch03.html#page_51">page 51</a>). Can you work out how to make the player jump into the air and then place a block immediately below them so they don’t fall? Feeling evil? You could write a program that has the player fall from a great height into a pool of lava.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec06"><a id="page_54"/><strong><span class="blue">USING MATH OPERATORS IN ARGUMENTS</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">When you use a function, such as <code>setBlock()</code> or <code>setTilePos()</code>, you give the function arguments, which specify the values you want the function to use when it runs.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, you’ve been introduced to the addition and subtraction operators. You can use these operators inside a function’s parentheses to set the values of arguments. Let’s revisit the stacking blocks in <a href="ch03.html#ch03lev2sec02">Mission #5</a> (<a href="ch03.html#page_49">page 49</a>). We can use the addition operator inside the parentheses of the <code>setBlock()</code> function, as shown in <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex6">Listing 3-6</a>, and it will add two values together within the parentheses without the need for an extra statement.</p>
<p class="sidenote"><span class="blue"><em>blockStack1.py</em></span></p>
<pre>   <span class="orange">from</span> mcpi.minecraft <span class="orange">import</span> Minecraft<br/>   mc = Minecraft.create()<br/><br/>   x = 6<br/>   y = 5<br/>   z = 28<br/>   blockType = 103<br/>   mc.setBlock(x, y, z, blockType)<br/><span class="ent">➊</span> mc.setBlock(x, y + 1, z, blockType)</pre>
<p class="examplet"><a id="ch3ex6"/><em>Listing 3-6: The block stacking program with an operator in the arguments</em></p>
<p class="indent"><a href="ch03.html#ch3ex6">Listing 3-6</a> is the almost same as the stacking blocks program. However, it uses the addition operator in the <code>setBlock()</code> function’s parentheses instead of in a separate statement. The last line uses <code>y + 1</code> as an argument in the function <span class="ent">➊</span>. Although the value of this argument is <code>6</code> (<code>5 + 1</code>), the value of the <code>y</code> variable is still <code>5</code>. The argument lets you add to the <code>y</code> variable without actually changing its value, which is useful if you want to use <code>y</code> again somewhere else in your code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also add two variables together and use them as a single argument. <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex7">Listing 3-7</a> is the same as <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex6">Listing 3-6</a>, but an extra variable named <code>up</code> determines the distance the new block will be placed on the y-axis.</p>
<p class="sidenote"><span class="blue"><em>blockStack2.py</em></span></p>
<pre>   <span class="orange">from</span> mcpi.minecraft <span class="orange">import</span> Minecraft<br/>   mc = Minecraft.create()<br/><br/>   x = 6<br/>   y = 5<br/>   z = 28<br/>   blockType = 103<br/>   up = 1<br/>   mc.setBlock(x, y, z, blockType)<br/><span class="ent">➊</span> mc.setBlock(x, y + up, z, blockType)</pre>
<p class="examplet"><a id="ch3ex7"/><em>Listing 3-7: Another version of the stacking program that uses an addition operator in the arguments</em></p>
<p class="indent">On the last line, the <code>y</code> and <code>up</code> variables are added together <span class="ent">➊</span>. As in <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex6">Listing 3-6</a>, this makes the <code>setBlock()</code> function’s second argument <code>6</code>. Variables are useful because if you want to place the new block two blocks higher on <a id="page_55"/>the y-axis, all you have to do is change your code and set <code>up</code> to 2. You can see the effect of all three versions (<a href="ch03.html#ch3ex1">Listings 3-1</a> and <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex2">3-2</a>, <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex6">3-6</a>, and <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex7">3-7</a>) of the program in <a href="ch03.html#ch3fig4">Figure 3-4</a>.</p>

<h4 class="h4a" id="ch03lev2sec07"><strong>MISSION #8: SPEED BUILDING</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Usually, you spend your first day in Minecraft building a shelter. With what you’ve learned so far, you can build a simple house and spend your first night in style! The program in this mission will help you quickly generate a building’s walls, ceiling, and floor. Instead of spending lots of time placing every block by hand, you can construct the basic structure of your building in a few lines of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ve used <code>setBlock()</code> to create a single block, but <code>setBlock()</code> has a friend called <code>setBlocks()</code>, which creates several blocks in the shape of a cuboid. A <em>cuboid</em> is a 3D rectangle. A cuboid’s length, width, and height can all be different values.</p>
<p class="indent">The <code>setBlocks()</code> function lets you create many blocks in a large area. To use <code>setBlocks()</code>, just pass it two sets of coordinates and the block type. The first set of coordinates identifies where you want one corner of the cuboid, and the second set specifies where you want the opposite corner. <a href="ch03.html#ch3fig5">Figure 3-5</a> shows you the corners of the cuboid, labeled with their coordinates.</p>

<p class="indent">Your mission is to change the program to create a building with walls, a ceiling, and a floor at the player’s position.

<p class="noindent">In Python code, multiplication looks slightly different from what you’re probably used to seeing. Instead of writing an × to multiply two numbers, you use an asterisk (<code>*</code>). But other than the symbol, multiplication works the same as usual. The expression <code>2 * 2</code> equals 4, just like 2 × 2.</p>
<p class="indent">Imagine there are four trees outside your Minecraft house, and suddenly the number of trees doubles. You can represent this calculation in Python like this:</p>
<pre>trees = 4<br/>trees = trees * 2</pre>
<p class="indent">The value of <code>trees</code> in this example is 8, which is 4 multiplied by 2.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec09"><strong><span class="blue">DIVISION</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">In Python, division is represented by a forward slash (<code>/</code>) instead of the ÷ symbol.</p>
<p class="indent">The division operator divides one value by another. Just put the number that you want to divide on the left side of the forward slash (<code>/</code>) and the number you want to divide by on the right.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say eight skeletons are outside your Minecraft fortress, but half of them walk away. To find out how many are left, you would divide 8 by 2. Here’s how you’d represent this using a division operator in Python:</p>
<pre>skeletons = 8<br/>skeletons = skeletons / 2</pre>
<p class="indent">Now just 4 skeletons are outside your fortress. Phew! Let’s try out these two operators in Minecraft.</p>
<h4 class="h4a" id="ch03lev2sec10"><strong>MISSION #9: SPECTACULAR SPIRES</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">One strength of variables is that you can change the value of a single variable, and its value will change everywhere the variable appears in the program. You can make a program do totally different things just by changing a single variable using math operators, like multiplication and division.</p>
<p class="indent">In this mission, you’ll discover how to use division and multiplication to build a very tall, thin tower, also called a <em>spire</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="ch03.html#ch3fig8">Figure 3-8</a> shows what the spire will look like when the program is finished.</p>

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch3fig8"/><em>Figure 3-8: A spire created from stone blocks</em></p>
<p class="indent">The program will use a single variable to set the spire’s height. Using multiplication and division, you’ll set different spire heights.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex9">Listing 3-9</a>, I’ve started the program that creates the spire, but I haven’t used the <code>height</code> variable or math operators to set the height of each part.</p>

<p class="examplet"><a id="ch3ex9"/><em>Listing 3-9: The spire-building program</em></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_60"/>Copy <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex9">Listing 3-9</a> into a new file in IDLE and save it as <em>spire.py</em> in the <em>math</em> folder. This program will create a spire, but changing the <code>height</code> variable and rerunning the program won’t affect the height of all parts of the spire.</p>
<p class="indent">To fix this program so all parts of the spire’s height change when you change the <code>height</code> variable, you need to change the <code>pointHeight</code> <span class="ent">➊</span> and <code>baseHeight</code> <span class="ent">➋</span> variables to include expressions that use the <code>height</code> variable and multiplication or division operators. You want <code>pointHeight</code> to be twice the size of <code>height</code> and <code>baseHeight</code> to be half the size of <code>height</code>. For example, if I wanted the spire point to be three times the height of the spire sides, I would change the code to <code>pointHeight = height * 3</code> and <code>baseHeight = height / 2</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">After you’ve made these changes, when you change the <code>height</code> variable, all the spire’s parts will change size.</p>
<p class="indent">You don’t need to change any other parts of the program.</p>
<p class="indent">You can test the program by changing the original <code>height</code> variable and rerunning it. If you change the <code>height</code> variable to <code>3</code>, your spire will look like <a href="ch03.html#ch3fig9">Figure 3-9</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="graphics/f03-09.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch3fig9"/><em>Figure 3-9: You can make the spire taller just by changing the</em> <code><span class="codeitalic">height</code></span> <em>variable.</em></p>
<p class="indent">Because you use the <code>height</code> variable to set the values for <code>pointHeight</code> and <code>baseHeight</code>, it’s very easy to change the spire. Play around with this code by changing the original <code>height</code> variable to a few different numbers. Rerun the program each time to see what happens!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec03"><strong><span class="blue">EXPONENTS</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">You can use an <em>exponent</em> to show that a number should be multiplied by itself a certain number of times. For example, 3<sup>4</sup> (three to the power of four) is a short way of saying <code>3 * 3 * 3 * 3</code>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_61"/>In Python, <code>**</code> is the exponential operator. The number you want to multiply (the <em>base</em>) goes on the left of the operator, and the number of times you want to multiply it by itself (the <em>exponent</em>) goes on the right.</p>
<p class="indent">Say you want to start a Minecraft farm. You need to till four plots of land. You want each plot of land to be four blocks by four blocks so you can grow lots of wheat. Mathematically, you can write this as <code>4 * 4 * 4</code>, or 4<sup>3</sup>. Here’s the code to work out how much wheat you’re growing:</p>
<pre>wheat = 4 ** 3</pre>
<p class="indent">Your answer should be 64 individual plots of wheat, because <code>4 * 4</code> is <code>16</code> and <code>16 * 4</code> is <code>64</code>.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec04"><strong><span class="blue">PARENTHESES AND ORDER OF OPERATIONS</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">When you use several math operators in one expression, you need to be careful how you arrange them. Different operators have different <em>priority</em>. When you’re using multiple operators, division and multiplication are evaluated first from left to right, and then addition and subtraction are calculated. Let’s look at how this expression is evaluated:</p>
<pre>mooshroom = 5 * 2 – 1 + 4 / 2</pre>
<p class="indent">Because multiplication and division always happen before addition and subtraction, Python starts on the left by multiplying 5 by 2 to get 10, and then divides 4 by 2 to get 2. That gives us 10 – 1 + 2. Next, Python starts back on the left by subtracting 1 from 10, and then adds 2 to that, setting <code>mooshroom</code> to 11.</p>
<p class="indent">But you can control the order of operations by using parentheses. Expressions with operators in parentheses will evaluate the operations in parentheses before anything else. Let’s look at how parentheses change the order of operations. To start, here’s a statement that doesn’t use any parentheses:</p>
<pre>zombiePigmen = 6 * 3 - 2</pre>
<p class="indent">Written this way, <code>zombiePigmen</code> ends up with a value of 16, because 6 times 3 is 18, and 18 minus 2 is 16. However, with parentheses, the result changes:</p>
<pre>zombiePigmen = 6 * (3 - 2)</pre>
<p class="indent"><code>zombiePigmen</code> now has a value of <code>6</code>! Instead of following the usual order, first Python subtracts 2 from 3, which results in 1, and then multiplies 6 by 1 to get 6.</p>
<p class="indent">When you want a calculation to happen in a certain order, use parentheses to tell Python what to do first. This gives you even more control over Python.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec05"><a id="page_62"/><strong><span class="blue">HANDY MATH TRICKS</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the following sections, I’ll teach you two more math skills to level up your Python programming, and then we’ll combine what you’ve learned so far in one more mission.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec11"><strong><span class="blue">SHORTHAND OPERATORS</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Quite often, you’ll want to use an operator on a variable and then store the result in the same variable. For example, you might want to add five sheep to your existing herd:</p>
<pre>sheep = 6<br/>sheep = sheep + 5</pre>
<p class="indentb">But typing <code>sheep = sheep + 5</code> will probably get tiresome after a while. Don’t worry; there’s a shorter way! Python has <em>shorthand operators</em> that let you use a math operator on a variable and reassign the result to the same variable. Here are the four shorthand operators:</p>
<p class="bull">• Addition (<code>+=</code>)</p>
<p class="bull">• Subtraction (<code>-=</code>)</p>
<p class="bull">• Multiplication (<code>*=</code>)</p>
<p class="bull">• Division (<code>/=</code>)</p>
<p class="indentt">For example, you can rewrite the sheep example using the addition shorthand operator:</p>
<pre>sheep = 6<br/>sheep += 5</pre>
<p class="indent">The value of <code>sheep</code> equals <code>11</code>, just like before.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch03lev2sec12"><strong><span class="blue">PLAYING WITH RANDOM NUMBERS</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Using random numbers is one way to add some mystery and fun to your programs. You never know what you’ll end up with! Many real-world board games rely on random numbers: think about how many games you’ve played where you had to roll the dice to see how many spaces you could move. A dice roll is a classic example of random numbers in action.</p>
<p class="indent">Python can generate random numbers for you easily, so let’s simulate the roll of a die. The number generated should be between 1 and 6:</p>
<pre><span class="ent">➊</span> <span class="orange">import</span> random<br/><span class="ent">➋</span> diceValue = random.randint(1, 6)</pre>
<p class="indent">When you want to create random numbers, make sure you include <code>import random</code> <span class="ent">➊</span> at the start of your program. The <code>randint()</code> <span class="ent">➋</span> function <a id="page_63"/>generates an integer value that the program can use just like any other number. The numbers you place inside the parentheses as arguments tell <code>randint()</code> to generate values between the first number and the second number. In this example, the number generated can have a value of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use <code>randint()</code> to add a random number to the value of a variable, and you can even generate negative numbers. Let’s see how!</p>
<pre><span class="orange">import</span> random<br/>score = 0<br/>score += random.randint(0, 99)<br/>points = random.randint(-99, 99)</pre>
<p class="indent">The lowest number that Python can generate to add to <code>score</code> is 0, and the highest is 99. On the other hand, because of the negative argument, <code>points</code> might get set to a number as low as –99!</p>
<h4 class="h4a" id="ch03lev2sec13"><strong>MISSION #10: SUPER JUMP SOMEWHERE NEW!</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter’s last mission, you’ll make the player jump a random distance on the x-, y-, and z-axes by storing the player’s current position and then adding a random number to each of the three coordinates. Use the random numbers between –10 and 10 to change the <code>x</code> and <code>z</code> values, and make sure the random values for <code>y</code> are between 0 and 10.</p>
<p class="indent">To get started, copy <a href="ch03.html#ch3ex10">Listing 3-10</a> into a new file in IDLE and save it as <em>randomJump.py</em>.</p>
<p class="sidenote"><span class="blue"><em>randomJump.py</em></span></p>

<p class="examplet"><a id="ch3ex10"/><em>Listing 3-10: The incomplete random jump program</em></p>
<p class="indent">The random number generation code for the <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> variables is missing, and it’s up to you to add it. Once you do, the player will have the ability to jump anywhere, as I did in <a href="ch03.html#ch3fig10">Figure 3-10</a>. Let the randomness take you to new and exciting places!</p>
<p class="indent">At the moment, the code doesn’t use shorthand operators to change the values of the variables. Try changing the addition expression at <span class="ent">➊</span> to use shorthand instead.</p>

<p class="sidebart"><strong>BONUS OBJECTIVE: RANDOM BLOCKS TELEPORTATION</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make the <em>randomJump.py</em> program even more random! After the player jumps to a random position, place a random block below them. You could also adapt the teleportation tour program from <a href="ch02.html#ch02lev2sec05">Mission #1</a> (see <em>teleport.py</em> on <a href="ch02.html#page_34">page 34</a>) to make the player teleport to a random position each time. If you accidentally teleport somewhere and get stuck, you can always rerun <em>teleport.py</em>, which should teleport you to somewhere safe.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch03lev1sec06"><strong><span class="blue">WHAT YOU LEARNED</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to do math in Python. You’ll use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division frequently in the Python programs in the rest of this book and in the programs that you create in the future. You’ve also learned how to generate random numbers and created some very useful programs in Minecraft along the way. Great job!</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>, you’ll learn about the string data type in Python, which is used to contain letters, symbols, and numbers. Strings are very useful in Minecraft, because you can use them to post messages to Minecraft’s chat. You’ll also explore strings to manipulate Minecraft’s chat and do other cool things.</p>

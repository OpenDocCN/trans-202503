    at Apple during the iPhone’s development and when it launched.

- en: Bob was in the original iPhone tutorial video on the Apple website when the
    iPhone was launched. What was remarkable about that video was not so much that
    it was an iPhone tutorial, or that it featured Bob, but that it was not starring
    Steve Jobs. Apple is famous in the industry for hiding most of the personalities
    in the company behind very closed doors. Only select people are anointed to be
    the face that represents the company. At that time, it was (of course) mostly
    Steve Jobs.

- en: A friend who worked there explained it to me. Apple is a consumer brand. It
    is not, unlike companies like Google or Microsoft, about the technology, and therefore
    the engineers and engineering itself, but rather about consumer products that
    happen to be built with technology. Presenting a very slick, polished, and consistent
    face to the world is part of that consumer-branding approach.

- en: Bob explained how he came to be in that video. “When Steve introduced NeXT,
    he did a video where he sat down for an hour and a half and introduced everybody
    to NextStep, the OS as well as the hardware, showed them all the great things,
    and helped people build their first program on NextStep. When we were thinking
    about how to introduce the iPhone to the world, we took that template and said,
    ‘Let’s do it again here.’ Initially our job was to write a rough script, and for
    me to be the test presenter. As it turns out, that test run turned into months
    of wearing a black shirt on camera.” When the team was ready to record the final
    version, Steve was too busy, so Bob got that job.

- en: At the time, stories had been circulating at Apple about what was happening
    at Google. “There were rumors that Google was going to do something around a mobile
    operating system. It wasn’t just, ‘There was going to be this amazing piece of
    hardware,’ it was, ‘They’re going to build a platform that others can use.’”

- en: Bob was able to nail down the timeframe for some of those rumors because he
    had a meeting with Google at that time. “October of 2006\. I remember, because
    the first meeting I had [at Google] with the team that we were negotiating with,
    the lead product manager showed up in a nun’s costume. The first Apple, iPhone,
    Google, Maps coming-together moment was Halloween of 2006\. I sat in a meeting
    room for 2 hours with a nun. A male nun at that.”

- en: But why was Apple concerned specifically with Google, especially since Google
    had zero track record with mobile devices? There were already plenty of other
    players in the mobile space, including RIM and Nokia and Microsoft. “Microsoft
    was already in the market with Windows Mobile. Our analysis was, Microsoft didn’t
    know hardware, so that was a horrible experience. All of the other players didn’t
    know software. We felt like software was going to be the thing that ate the mobile
    world.

- en: “The big threat from Google was that Google knew software and services. In fact,
    probably knew them better than Apple did. So I think the fundamental concern was,
    here’s Google, a company that’s built software and services at scale before, and
    that could and would legitimately be a significant threat to a new platform like
    iOS.

    business to put at risk when working with carriers.”

- en: Apple was very interested to see what the result was when the first Android
    device, the G1, launched. “I remember going, on the first day that they were available,
    to the store in San Francisco to buy one and bring it back to Cupertino to play
    with. The software experience was. . . . We saw potential.” The actual G1 product
    didn’t cause much fear in Cupertino.^([2](#c38-footnote-2))

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Apple wasn’t as concerned about Android, or at least about the G1, after they
    saw the device, because they really saw themselves as competing on the product
    level, not the platform level: “We weren’t really thinking of iOS as a platform.
    When we officially launched the first SDK and the App Store, which was like two
    or three years into it—that’s when we started to think of it as a platform.”'

- en: Meanwhile, Android beat Apple to the application marketplace, and Android 1.0
    shipped with the Android Market app that allowed developers to distribute their
    own applications. The iPhone had originally shipped without any App Store at all,
    and no intention to provide one.

- en: After the iPhone was available, there was mounting interest in having more apps.
    “There was so much developer desire and so many requests. The first step was to
    go build web apps. That was perfect, because nobody was actually installing any
    software on the phone, but you can have an app-like experience. Our hope was that
    web apps were going to be the thing.”

- en: But eventually, Apple was pressured by both consumers and developers to provide
    a way for developers to provide high-quality native apps for the iPhone. “We were
    utterly focused on the consumer experience, and consumers were telling us that
    they wanted higher quality applications, as developers were telling us they wanted
    to build higher quality applications.” The App Store was launched, with a more
    curated model than Android, in keeping with Apple’s approach to controlling the
    overall experience more tightly.

- en: Bob also commented on the effect that the iPhone had on carriers. The iPhone
    launched with an exclusive deal with AT&T in the US, and similar exclusive carrier
    deals in other countries. This forced other carriers like T-Mobile and Verizon
    to seek other options. “We early on established that we were going to launch exclusively
    with one carrier in each market. That meant that there would be two or three other
    carriers in every market who needed to fill up that vacuum some way, somehow.
    So there was a vacuum created for Android to fill.”

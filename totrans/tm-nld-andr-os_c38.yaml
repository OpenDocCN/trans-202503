  zh: Bob Borchers曾是苹果iPhone产品营销的高级总监^([1](#c38-footnote-1))，负责iPhone的开发和发布。
- en: Bob was in the original iPhone tutorial video on the Apple website when the
    iPhone was launched. What was remarkable about that video was not so much that
    it was an iPhone tutorial, or that it featured Bob, but that it was not starring
    Steve Jobs. Apple is famous in the industry for hiding most of the personalities
    in the company behind very closed doors. Only select people are anointed to be
    the face that represents the company. At that time, it was (of course) mostly
    Steve Jobs.

  zh: 当iPhone发布时，Bob出现在了苹果官网的原版iPhone教程视频中。这个视频令人印象深刻的地方，不仅仅是它是一个iPhone教程，或者它有Bob的身影，而是它没有由史蒂夫·乔布斯出演。苹果在业界因将公司大部分高管隐藏在严密的门后而闻名，只有少数人被选中作为公司面孔代表。那时（当然）主要是史蒂夫·乔布斯。
- en: A friend who worked there explained it to me. Apple is a consumer brand. It
    is not, unlike companies like Google or Microsoft, about the technology, and therefore
    the engineers and engineering itself, but rather about consumer products that
    happen to be built with technology. Presenting a very slick, polished, and consistent
    face to the world is part of that consumer-branding approach.

  zh: 一位在那里工作的朋友向我解释过。苹果是一个消费品牌。与谷歌或微软这样的公司不同，它不是关于技术的，也不是关于工程师和工程本身，而是关于那些恰好用技术构建的消费产品。向世界展示一个非常光鲜、精致且一致的形象是这种消费品牌策略的一部分。
- en: Bob explained how he came to be in that video. “When Steve introduced NeXT,
    he did a video where he sat down for an hour and a half and introduced everybody
    to NextStep, the OS as well as the hardware, showed them all the great things,
    and helped people build their first program on NextStep. When we were thinking
    about how to introduce the iPhone to the world, we took that template and said,
    ‘Let’s do it again here.’ Initially our job was to write a rough script, and for
    me to be the test presenter. As it turns out, that test run turned into months
    of wearing a black shirt on camera.” When the team was ready to record the final
    version, Steve was too busy, so Bob got that job.

  zh: Bob解释了他是如何出现在那个视频中的。“当史蒂夫介绍NeXT时，他做了一个视频，坐下来一个半小时，向大家介绍NextStep操作系统以及硬件，展示所有的优点，并帮助人们在NextStep上构建他们的第一个程序。当我们在思考如何向世界介绍iPhone时，我们采用了那个模板，决定‘在这里再做一次’。最初，我们的工作是写一个粗略的脚本，由我来做测试主持人。结果，那个测试环节变成了几个月的黑衬衫试镜。”当团队准备录制最终版本时，史蒂夫太忙了，所以Bob接下了这个工作。
- en: At the time, stories had been circulating at Apple about what was happening
    at Google. “There were rumors that Google was going to do something around a mobile
    operating system. It wasn’t just, ‘There was going to be this amazing piece of
    hardware,’ it was, ‘They’re going to build a platform that others can use.’”

  zh: 当时，苹果内部关于谷歌正在发生的事情有很多传言。“有传闻说谷歌将要做一些关于移动操作系统的事情。这不仅仅是‘会有一款令人惊叹的硬件’，而是‘他们要打造一个平台，供其他人使用’。”
- en: Bob was able to nail down the timeframe for some of those rumors because he
    had a meeting with Google at that time. “October of 2006\. I remember, because
    the first meeting I had [at Google] with the team that we were negotiating with,
    the lead product manager showed up in a nun’s costume. The first Apple, iPhone,
    Google, Maps coming-together moment was Halloween of 2006\. I sat in a meeting
    room for 2 hours with a nun. A male nun at that.”

  zh: Bob能够确认这些谣言的时间框架，因为那时他与谷歌有一个会议。“2006年10月。我记得，因为我第一次和我们谈判的团队在[谷歌]开会时，首席产品经理穿着修女服出现。2006年10月，苹果、iPhone、谷歌、地图的第一次碰撞发生在万圣节。我和一位修女坐在会议室里待了2个小时。还是一位男修女。”
- en: But why was Apple concerned specifically with Google, especially since Google
    had zero track record with mobile devices? There were already plenty of other
    players in the mobile space, including RIM and Nokia and Microsoft. “Microsoft
    was already in the market with Windows Mobile. Our analysis was, Microsoft didn’t
    know hardware, so that was a horrible experience. All of the other players didn’t
    know software. We felt like software was going to be the thing that ate the mobile
    world.

  zh: 但是，为什么 Apple 特别关注 Google，尤其是考虑到 Google 在移动设备方面几乎没有任何经验呢？在移动领域已经有了很多其他竞争者，包括
    RIM、诺基亚和微软。“微软已经在市场上推出了 Windows Mobile。我们的分析是，微软不懂硬件，所以那是一个糟糕的体验。其他所有的竞争者都不懂软件。我们认为，软件将是主导移动世界的关键。”
- en: “The big threat from Google was that Google knew software and services. In fact,
    probably knew them better than Apple did. So I think the fundamental concern was,
    here’s Google, a company that’s built software and services at scale before, and
    that could and would legitimately be a significant threat to a new platform like
    iOS.

  zh: “Google 的重大威胁是，Google 对软件和服务的了解。事实上，可能比 Apple 更了解。所以我认为根本的担忧是，这里有 Google，一家曾经在大规模构建软件和服务的公司，它可以并且会对像
    iOS 这样的新平台构成重大威胁。”

    business to put at risk when working with carriers.”

- en: Apple was very interested to see what the result was when the first Android
    device, the G1, launched. “I remember going, on the first day that they were available,
    to the store in San Francisco to buy one and bring it back to Cupertino to play
    with. The software experience was. . . . We saw potential.” The actual G1 product
    didn’t cause much fear in Cupertino.^([2](#c38-footnote-2))

  zh: Apple 非常关注第一款 Android 设备 G1 发布后的结果。“我记得在它们上市的第一天，我去了旧金山的商店买了一部，然后带回库比蒂诺玩。软件体验是……我们看到了潜力。”实际的
    G1 产品并没有在库比蒂诺引起太大的恐慌。[2]
- en: 'Apple wasn’t as concerned about Android, or at least about the G1, after they
    saw the device, because they really saw themselves as competing on the product
    level, not the platform level: “We weren’t really thinking of iOS as a platform.
    When we officially launched the first SDK and the App Store, which was like two
    or three years into it—that’s when we started to think of it as a platform.”'

  zh: 在他们看到 G1 设备之后，Apple 对 Android 并不那么担心，至少对 G1 不太担心，因为他们确实认为自己是在产品层面上竞争，而不是平台层面：“我们当时并没有把
    iOS 看作一个平台。当我们正式发布第一个 SDK 和 App Store时，大约是两三年之后，那时我们才开始把它当作一个平台来考虑。”
- en: Meanwhile, Android beat Apple to the application marketplace, and Android 1.0
    shipped with the Android Market app that allowed developers to distribute their
    own applications. The iPhone had originally shipped without any App Store at all,
    and no intention to provide one.

  zh: 与此同时，Android 领先于 Apple 进入了应用市场，Android 1.0 搭载了 Android Market 应用程序，允许开发者分发自己的应用程序。iPhone
    最初发布时根本没有 App Store，也没有计划提供。
- en: After the iPhone was available, there was mounting interest in having more apps.
    “There was so much developer desire and so many requests. The first step was to
    go build web apps. That was perfect, because nobody was actually installing any
    software on the phone, but you can have an app-like experience. Our hope was that
    web apps were going to be the thing.”

  zh: 在 iPhone 发布后，人们对更多应用程序的需求不断增加。“开发者的需求非常大，大家都在请求。第一步是去构建 Web 应用程序。这是完美的，因为当时没有人在手机上安装软件，但你可以拥有类似应用的体验。我们的希望是，Web
    应用会成为主流。”
- en: But eventually, Apple was pressured by both consumers and developers to provide
    a way for developers to provide high-quality native apps for the iPhone. “We were
    utterly focused on the consumer experience, and consumers were telling us that
    they wanted higher quality applications, as developers were telling us they wanted
    to build higher quality applications.” The App Store was launched, with a more
    curated model than Android, in keeping with Apple’s approach to controlling the
    overall experience more tightly.

  zh: 但最终，Apple 在消费者和开发者的压力下，提供了一种方式，让开发者为 iPhone 提供高质量的原生应用程序。“我们完全专注于消费者体验，而消费者告诉我们，他们希望有更高质量的应用程序，同时开发者也告诉我们，他们希望开发出更高质量的应用程序。”App
    Store 被推出，采用了比 Android 更加精选的模式，符合 Apple 更加严格控制整体体验的方法。
- en: Bob also commented on the effect that the iPhone had on carriers. The iPhone
    launched with an exclusive deal with AT&T in the US, and similar exclusive carrier
    deals in other countries. This forced other carriers like T-Mobile and Verizon
    to seek other options. “We early on established that we were going to launch exclusively
    with one carrier in each market. That meant that there would be two or three other
    carriers in every market who needed to fill up that vacuum some way, somehow.
    So there was a vacuum created for Android to fill.”

  zh: Bob还评论了iPhone对运营商的影响。iPhone在美国与AT&T签订了独家合作协议，并且在其他国家也有类似的独家运营商合作协议。这迫使其他运营商，如T-Mobile和Verizon，寻找其他选项。“我们早期就确定了要在每个市场与一个运营商独家合作。这意味着在每个市场都会有两到三个其他运营商需要以某种方式填补这个空缺。所以，Android就在这个空缺中找到了机会。”

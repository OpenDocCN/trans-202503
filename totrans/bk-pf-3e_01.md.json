["```\nCompared to working with iptables, PF is like this haiku:\n\nA breath of fresh air,\nfloating on white rose petals,\neating strawberries.\n\nNow I'm getting carried away:\n\nHartmeier codes now,\nHenning knows not why it fails,\nfails only for n00b.\n\nTables load my lists,\ntarpit for the asshole spammer,\ndeath to his mail store.\n\nCARP due to Cisco,\nredundant blessed packets,\nlicensed free for me.\n```"]

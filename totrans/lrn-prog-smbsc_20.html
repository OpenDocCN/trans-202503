<p class="noindent">You can convert any Small Basic program into an equivalent Visual Basic program, which lets you transition to the full power of a professional programming language. First, you’ll need to download Visual Studio for free. Go to <em><a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/">http://www.visualstudio.com/</a></em> and click <strong>Free Visual Studio</strong> in the upper right.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, go to the Small Basic toolbar, click <strong>Graduate</strong>, select your <strong>Output Location</strong>, and click <strong>Continue</strong>. Visual Studio will open with the code translated into Visual Basic! Head back to the Visual Studio website for getting started documentation on Visual Basic and the Visual Studio interface. And if you have any questions about the graduating experience, ask us in the Small Basic forum.</p>&#13;

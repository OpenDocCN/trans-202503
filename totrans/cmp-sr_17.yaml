- en: If you found that your computer was already set up without you having to go
    through the steps in “[Setting Up Your Computer](ch00.xhtml#toc_lev17)” on [page
    17](ch00.xhtml#page_17), it’s possible that you have a *local account* rather
    than a Microsoft account. This can happen if you upgraded from an older operating
    system, like Windows 7, or if the shop selling you the computer set it up in advance.
    A local account lets you log into your computer and use it in the same way, but
    it doesn’t give you access to any of Microsoft’s online services such as the Store,
    OneDrive, Skype, and the Mail app, which you’ll need for this book. Here’s how
    to check if you have a Microsoft account and, if you don’t, how to create one.

    email address, it means you have a Microsoft account and there’s no need to proceed
    to set one up. If this line says “Local Account,” you don’t have a Microsoft account,
    so continue to the next section to create a Microsoft account.

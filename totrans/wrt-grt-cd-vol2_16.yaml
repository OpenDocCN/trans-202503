- en: The goal of this volume was to help you consider the impact of your high-level
    coding techniques on the resulting machine code generated by the compiler. Unless
    you understand the cost tradeoffs of statements and data structures in your HLL
    programs, you won’t be able to produce efficient programs consistently. And if
    you want to write great code, you can’t write inefficient programs. To that end,
    the first two books of this series, *Understanding the Machine* and *Thinking
    Low-Level, Writing High-Level*, have addressed efficiency concerns facing modern
    programmers. However, as noted in [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#ch01), efficiency isn’t
    the only attribute of great code. Thus, the next volume, *Engineering Software*,
    will change direction and discuss some of the other attributes.

    of programming. The software engineering field focuses primarily on the management
    of large software systems. Personal software engineering, on the other hand, covers
    those topics germane to writing great code at a personal level—craftsmanship,
    art, and pride in one’s work. So, in *Engineering Software*, we’ll consider those
    aspects through discussions on software development metaphors, software developer
    metaphors, and system documentation, among other topics.

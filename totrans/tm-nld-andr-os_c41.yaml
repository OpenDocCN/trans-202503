    23, 2008\. On one hand, 1.0 was just another update in a long series of updates
    since the initial m3 release 10 months before, up through the 0.9 release a mere
    five weeks earlier, on August 18.

    the team’s final thoughts on what the official, supported API would be for Android
    from here on out, because there was no more changing of APIs without breaking
    applications that had been built against them.

    fanfare. There was no press event; just some bits uploaded to a server, along
    with Release Notes about the fixes that were in this version. Even the introductory
    sentence of the Release Notes is understated. If you didn’t know what you were
    looking at, you’d think it was just another update (which, to some extent, it
    was):'

- en: Google didn’t gather the media for the developer-targeted SDK launch, but they
    did get up on stage at a press conference in New York City with T-Mobile to announce
    the consumer phone that would run 1.0\. The same day as the 1.0 SDK shipped, representatives
    talked about the new device, and T-Mobile issued a press release entitled, “T-Mobile
    Unveils the T-Mobile G1—the First Phone Powered by Android.”

- en: The G1 device would have a touchscreen, a slide-to-open QWERTY keyboard, and
    a trackball. It would run Google Maps, search, and it would offer apps from Android
    Market. It would come with a three-megapixel camera and would run on T-Mobile’s
    new 3G network. It would sell for $179 on contract, or $399 unlocked, starting
    in the US and expanding to other countries in the following weeks.

    Once again, there was no big, staged event for this developer-focused release.
    In fact, this time there wasn’t even a press release, just a short three-paragraph
    blurb on the Android Developers Blog^([1](#c41-footnote-1)) with the title, “Android
    is now Open Source.”

    It had pitched the idea to investors, to Google, to team members, to carrier and
    manufacturer partners, and to developers worldwide. And now, 11 months after the
    first public SDK and one month after 1.0, it made good on all of those promises
    and published all of the code for everyone to see and use.

    Romain Guy was there, taking a picture of the first buyer. Nowadays, it’s hard
    to imagine caring who is buying what phone where, but at the time, this first
    purchase was the culmination of years of hard work by the development team; it
    was exciting to see their efforts make it into the real world and to see people
    line up to purchase them. Someone else who was at the store that day was Bob Borchers,
    the Senior Director of Product Marketing for the iPhone. He was purchasing one
    for his team to play around with back at Apple.

- en: The G1 was the first in a long line of devices that were developed as a collaboration
    between manufacturer (HTC), carrier (T-Mobile), and Google. The original idea
    behind these Google-collaboration devices was that they would showcase the new
    capabilities of the latest release. At the same time, these phones also allowed
    the team to prove out new functionality to ensure that what was being built actually
    worked on real hardware. In the case of the G1, this hardware allowed the team
    to prove that the Android platform worked, could provide full capabilities for
    a functional consumer device, and could provide building blocks for more platform
    functionality and more devices to come.

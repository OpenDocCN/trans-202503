- en: The survivalist community has an odd relationship with fitness. Some of its
    members are fascinated by military tactics and believe that any person who can’t
    bench-press 300 pounds is unlikely to make it through any crisis of note. At the
    same time, in a country where one-third of adults are obese, there’s no shortage
    of preppers whose weight undoubtedly interferes with their health or the enjoyment
    of their lives—but who don’t consider this fact to be in any way relevant to their
    emergency preparedness plans.

    may be causing more harm than they purport to cure. But for all this nuance, there’s
    no denying that obesity is a real foe. Among men aged 45, for example, the lifetime
    odds of diabetes skyrockets from single digits for underweight individuals to
    50 percent for those with a BMI of 30 or more.^([1](b02.xhtml#c11-endnote-1))

    ultimately shaving years off our lives or robbing us of the ability to enjoy them
    in good health—in itself a worthy preparedness goal. Further, chronic illness
    can make it difficult to cope with even fairly prosaic and short-lived emergencies.
    This isn’t because we must be able to lift a car or scale a 30-foot wall, but
    because we might find it difficult to carry out basic storm cleanup tasks—or to
    get a refill for insulin. In short: if your BMI is inching toward the danger zone,
    it’s wise to put a plan in motion that stands to reverse the trend.'

    succeed. Much of this appears to have to do with trying to run a sprint when we
    ought to be running a marathon. A week-long bout of absolute fasting can easily
    rid someone of 5 to 10 pounds, but it’s going to be a miserable experience followed
    by a rapid rebound. To be successful, you need a sustainable method that doesn’t
    amount to torture and doesn’t leave you craving familiar foods.

    abandon a lifetime of dietary habits, taste preferences, and eating schedules—and
    stuff themselves full of kale, turnips, quinoa, açaí berry, or whatever else happens
    to be the “fat-fighting superfood” of the week. To add insult to injury, most
    nutrition fads aren’t backed up by reproducible science; suffice to say that in
    the ’70s, table sugar was widely touted as a dieting aid.^([2](b02.xhtml#c11-endnote-2))
    Even today, a lot of weight-loss advice revolves around dubious or disproved concepts—say,
    the existence of negative-calorie foods, the alleged superiority of low-carb and
    high-fat diets, the evils of high-fructose corn syrup and aspartame, or the significance
    of eating on a particular schedule throughout the day.

    too. For example, contrary to common wisdom, bananas aren’t any healthier than
    potatoes, and the bulk nutritional qualities of a glass of apple juice are pretty
    close to those of a can of Sprite. Heck, good old butter has fewer calories than
    olive or coconut oil, so a sophisticated and “healthy” bruschetta isn’t far off
    from a less-reputable southern delicacy: deep-fried butter on a stick. The same
    goes for fast-food choices. The supposedly nutritious burrito from Chipotle easily
    packs four times as many calories as a greasy burger from McDonald’s, while a
    loaded coffee at Starbucks is about the same as two hot dogs with a heaping side
    of mashed potatoes to boot.'

- en: Perhaps the most sustainable approach to weight loss is to make sure that our
    diets don’t feel like diets. Ultimately, calories matter far more than anything
    else. The maintenance calorie intake for most individuals who don’t perform hard
    physical labor hovers around 2,000 kcal a day, and to safely lose about five pounds
    a month, the number needs to be brought down to about 1,400 to 1,500 kcal.

    well-established satiating effect. One notable example are mashed or boiled potatoes,
    with an empirical satiety index three times that of bread. Other contenders include
    oatmeal, apples, and oranges.^([4](b02.xhtml#c11-endnote-4)) Insoluble dietary
    fiber supplements or protein shakes in the morning are sometimes reported to help
    too.

    to skip regular meals—but to cut all portions in half, even if it means throwing
    out a half-eaten burger. The method may seem nonsensical, but it works because
    portion control is almost entirely psychological. Our blood hormone and nutrient
    levels go up only some time after we’ve cleaned our plate, so we habitually eat
    more than our body needs to feel full.^([5](b02.xhtml#c11-endnote-5))

    easier than it sounds. For example, salted popcorn or Lipton noodle soup are two
    easy, extremely lean options that are well liked by most; peanuts, on the other
    hand, pack a ton of calories despite having a reputation as a healthy snack. Some
    less trendy veggies, such as carrots, raw sauerkraut, or pickles, make for guilt-free
    choices too. And for soda addicts, artificially sweetened variants are almost
    certainly a better alternative to sugary versions, despite some lingering controversy.

    or “low carb” ice cream, yogurt, cake, pizza, pasta, and so on. The differences
    are so minor that we might as well have the real thing and stop fooling ourselves.
    It’s also important to watch out for deceptive portion sizes. For example, Cheetos
    are labeled as 150 calories per serving, but a regular bag contains almost 10
    servings. Frozen fries are another sneaky example. They look pretty low-cal until
    you realize that a serving is only around 10 to 15 pieces.

    well-known method is exercise. This is the source of a rift in the weight-loss
    community. Some believe in diets, and others swear by hitting the gym.

- en: I don’t think one approach fits all, but it needs to be said that exercise takes
    a lot of time. For an effect comparable to the calorie-restriction goals outlined
    earlier in the chapter, one would need to sprint for an hour a day, every single
    day. In the long haul, such demanding exercise regimes tend to be difficult to
    maintain, especially for people with children or taxing jobs. On top of that,
    drastic increases in physical activity can trigger cravings or upend nutritional
    needs, causing paradoxical weight gain unless calorie intake is closely monitored.

    is to set realistic, long-term goals. Effortlessly losing one or two pounds a
    week while slowly developing better eating habits is far more meaningful than
    pulling off a bold but unsustainable feat. It helps to get an accurate bathroom
    scale, take daily measurements first thing in the morning, and put the data in
    a spreadsheet to monitor the results. For most overweight or obese people, it
    may take six to nine months to achieve the desired outcome. Daily fluctuations
    are almost completely meaningless; the trend to look for is a consistent and predictable
    biweekly drop.

    should talk to a doctor first. In such situations, aggressive dieting can carry
    additional risks that call for routine blood or heart monitoring along the way.
    Similarly, if any diet makes you feel listless or sick, it’s definitely time to
    give it a break.

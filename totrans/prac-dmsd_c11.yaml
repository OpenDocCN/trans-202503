- en: The survivalist community has an odd relationship with fitness. Some of its
    members are fascinated by military tactics and believe that any person who can’t
    bench-press 300 pounds is unlikely to make it through any crisis of note. At the
    same time, in a country where one-third of adults are obese, there’s no shortage
    of preppers whose weight undoubtedly interferes with their health or the enjoyment
    of their lives—but who don’t consider this fact to be in any way relevant to their
    emergency preparedness plans.

  zh: 生存主义者社区与健身的关系颇为奇特。社区中的一些成员对军事战术非常感兴趣，并认为任何不能卧推300磅的人都不太可能在重大危机中生还。与此同时，在一个三分之一成年人是肥胖的国家中，也不乏那些体重无疑影响其健康或生活享受的生存主义者——但他们并不认为这一点与他们的应急准备计划有任何关系。
- en: Of course, unrealistic body standards push many to depression or worse, and
    may be causing more harm than they purport to cure. But for all this nuance, there’s
    no denying that obesity is a real foe. Among men aged 45, for example, the lifetime
    odds of diabetes skyrockets from single digits for underweight individuals to
    50 percent for those with a BMI of 30 or more.^([1](b02.xhtml#c11-endnote-1))

  zh: 当然，不切实际的身体标准让许多人陷入抑郁甚至更糟，可能带来的伤害远超过它们所声称能治愈的。但是，尽管有这些细微差别，无法否认肥胖是一个真实的敌人。例如，在45岁的男性中，糖尿病的终生发病几率，从体重过轻者的个位数飙升至体重指数（BMI）达到30或以上的人的50%。^([1](b02.xhtml#c11-endnote-1))

    ultimately shaving years off our lives or robbing us of the ability to enjoy them
    in good health—in itself a worthy preparedness goal. Further, chronic illness
    can make it difficult to cope with even fairly prosaic and short-lived emergencies.
    This isn’t because we must be able to lift a car or scale a 30-foot wall, but
    because we might find it difficult to carry out basic storm cleanup tasks—or to
    get a refill for insulin. In short: if your BMI is inching toward the danger zone,
    it’s wise to put a plan in motion that stands to reverse the trend.'

    of eating on a particular schedule throughout the day.

    potatoes, and the bulk nutritional qualities of a glass of apple juice are pretty

    olive or coconut oil, so a sophisticated and “healthy” bruschetta isn’t far off
    from a less-reputable southern delicacy: deep-fried butter on a stick. The same
    goes for fast-food choices. The supposedly nutritious burrito from Chipotle easily

    diets don’t feel like diets. Ultimately, calories matter far more than anything
    else. The maintenance calorie intake for most individuals who don’t perform hard
    physical labor hovers around 2,000 kcal a day, and to safely lose about five pounds
    a month, the number needs to be brought down to about 1,400 to 1,500 kcal.

    out a half-eaten burger. The method may seem nonsensical, but it works because
    portion control is almost entirely psychological. Our blood hormone and nutrient
    levels go up only some time after we’ve cleaned our plate, so we habitually eat
    more than our body needs to feel full.^([5](b02.xhtml#c11-endnote-5))

    easy, extremely lean options that are well liked by most; peanuts, on the other
    hand, pack a ton of calories despite having a reputation as a healthy snack. Some
    less trendy veggies, such as carrots, raw sauerkraut, or pickles, make for guilt-free
    choices too. And for soda addicts, artificially sweetened variants are almost
    certainly a better alternative to sugary versions, despite some lingering controversy.

    or “low carb” ice cream, yogurt, cake, pizza, pasta, and so on. The differences
    are so minor that we might as well have the real thing and stop fooling ourselves.
    It’s also important to watch out for deceptive portion sizes. For example, Cheetos
    are labeled as 150 calories per serving, but a regular bag contains almost 10
    servings. Frozen fries are another sneaky example. They look pretty low-cal until

    day. In the long haul, such demanding exercise regimes tend to be difficult to

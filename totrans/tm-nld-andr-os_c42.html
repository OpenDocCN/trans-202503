<span class="ChapterTitle">G1 Reception</span></h1>
</header>
<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">T</span>he G1 didn’t overtake the iPhone in sales, didn’t become a worldwide best-seller, and didn’t become the phone that everyone had to have.</p>
<p>The reviews shared the opinion that it was . . . interesting. The hardware wasn’t awful, although the screen was quite small. It didn’t support video recording. And there were not many must-have applications beyond the pre-installed Google apps.</p>
<p>On the Android team, too, the reception was mixed. As Fadden said, “The G1 was right on the edge of good but was a bit lumpy and awkward.”</p>
<p>Dan Egnor agreed: “It was kind of this enthusiast device. Some people were excited about it, but in many ways, it was kind of a crappy device. It showed a lot of potential. But for somebody to adopt it? It wasn’t exactly flying off the shelves.”</p>
<p>Dave Burke talked about the G1: “The impression was: ‘Wow, this thing is sophisticated, it can do a lot. If anything . . . it can do almost too much.’ It had a keyboard and it had a trackpad and a rollerball and touch. It had everything. All these sensors. You got a feeling initially that Android was trying to do everything. I remember thinking at the time, What’s going to survive? Is the keyboard and the touchscreen going to survive? Is that trackball really going to be the thing? There was recognition that this thing was super-powerful, but total uncertainty that it might have been a one-off and flopped. It wasn’t clear to people.”</p>
<p>Dianne said, “The G1 was definitely an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink device . . . which as a general consumer product, is not the best thing in the world. But it was good for the platform since we had to support all of that stuff.” So while it might not have created the best consumer experience for a phone,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c42-footnote-1" id="c42-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_330" title="330"/>it paved the way for a myriad of follow-on devices that were able to take advantage of the myriad of capabilities that the platform provided.</p>
<p>Holiday sales are the biggest time of year for new devices. Dan Egnor remembered that first holiday with the G1: “Michael Morrissey [manager of the services team] had bad memories of Christmas day spikes [from Danger], and nobody on the team being available while things were melting down. So he was like, ‘We’re gonna have an on-call coverage that day. We’re gonna have a War Room. Who’s gonna be around? Big sacrifice, working Christmas Day. . . . ‘I was like, I’ll do this, sure.’ And then nothing happened. We had more activations than a typical day, but there wasn’t even a particularly large spike.”</p>
<p>So the G1 wasn’t an immediate overnight triumph. But there was promise.</p>
<p>It was decent enough for people to take the phone seriously. And it was purchased in real, if not overwhelming, numbers. T-Mobile reported<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c42-footnote-2" id="c42-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup> that it had reached sales of over a million units in the US six months later. This was, coincidentally, the number of devices needed in that timeframe to convince the Google networking team to not take back its dedicated VIP resource<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c42-footnote-3" id="c42-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup> from the Android services team, which would have caused serious problems for all of the Google apps on Android.</p>
<p>The G1 also provided a decent enough experience for people to take Android seriously as a platform. Android had finally been released out into the world. People were able to use the device and the platform to do what they needed to do, and that was good enough for now. Consumers could take Android seriously as a phone, and potential partners could take Android seriously as a platform. It allowed manufacturers to see that Android was real and that they could use it to build their own devices, which would eventually be more interesting and more powerful than that initial G1.</p>
<p>Hiroshi said, “The G1 made Android. Commercially, G1 wasn’t a huge success. The G1 was good but wasn’t a huge volume driver and didn’t really get that much attention outside of the tech industry. But launching it made it real for the OEMs: ‘OK these people can actually ship. It’s a real thing. It’s not vaporware.’ By the time G1 launched, we were already in discussions with all the major OEMs, who eventually became our partners.”</p>

Except Homer.</p></aside>

    it was pointed out to them. It’s an easy mistake to make. The most noticeable
    output of design thinking is packaging—how we speak about things, how something
    looks, what features go where, and how features behave. When we consider the end
    results, designers seem most effective when relegated to polishing up a product
    in the final stages. We do ourselves and our teams a disservice when we dismiss
    the toolkit of a designer in this way. Design is critical to making good technical

    Responsive teams, on the other hand, are calmer and more thoughtful. They’re able
    to sort new information as it becomes available into different scopes and contexts.

    users don’t know what they want. Sometimes the user and the researcher use the

    else has missed. Developing a brilliant solution. Of those options, developing

    question in mind. We have a problem or a decision to make, and we want to hear
    other perspectives. Or, we’re about to invest in a new product, and we want to
    know if the users will like it. The most common design exercise for engineering
    teams is observing potential users interacting with a product. A good researcher
    will be careful not to lead users, not to teach them how to use the product, but
    let them interact with it organically and use carefully worded questions to direct
    them to functions relevant to the research objective.

    interviews—we need to look at all the data and draw a conclusion. Just like engineering,
    design is often an iterative process. The conclusion of one exercise may create
    the research question for the next. For example, if a user research session reveals
    that users don’t understand how to interact with the product, future research
    sessions will test alternative interfaces until the organization has found something

    Therefore, just asking someone to put a unit value next to an outcome is forcing
    them to articulate a confidence level. The wondrous thing about this design is
    that if you ask people to rate their confidence level between 1 and 10, most of
    them would struggle to answer. It’s the unit itself, the knowledge of how much
    a dollar or an hour means to them, and what it means to lose a certain amount
    of dollars or time that helps research subjects articulate their feelings. It
    doesn’t matter that they will not lose what they’ve bet, just imagining *this
    much money* or *that much time* is enough to help people place where their feelings
    are on a spectrum.

- en: You can do this exercise alone when struggling with your own decisions. When
    I do it with teams, I like to put everyone’s bets for each outcome in a shared
    document or on a whiteboard. Then we discuss how confident the team feels that
    the positive outcomes would be reached by making the decision one way or the other.
    By this point, the right decision is usually much more obvious.

    harder to manage software projects than hardware projects? Conway’s insight linking
    the structure of software to the structure of the committees that invented it

    of maintaining the system over time. One organization I worked for had an entire
    stable of custom-built solutions for things such as caching, routing, and message
    handling. Senior management hated this but felt their complaints—even their instructions
    that it stop—did little to course-correct. Culturally, the engineering organization
    was flat, with teams formed on an ad hoc basis. Opportunities to work on interesting
    technical challenges were awarded based on personal relationships, so the organization’s

    and system safety, called the outcome of this cognition problem on system safety
    *drift*.^([10](#c07-footnote-10)) Systems do not generally fail all at once; they
    “drift” into failure via feedback loops caused by a desire to prevent failure.
    Let’s suppose a worker is given a set of checklists with necessary steps to maintain
    the system in good working order. If she misses a step and the system doesn’t
    fail immediately, her perception of risk changes. Skipping that step becomes not
    such a big deal, unlikely to cause failure. The more she skips the step, the more
    convinced of the safety of her action she becomes. She overlooks the possibility
    that she could have just gotten lucky. The more corners she cuts, the more prone
    to failure the system becomes.

    of a random series of events unlikely to recur. Her ability to respond appropriately
    is determined by her ability to assess the probability of what has just happened
    correctly. If she overestimates, she will find new steps to add to the checklist
    to ensure that an unlikely failure does not recur. Over time, the checklists become
    more and more cumbersome and increase the likelihood that either she or one of

    The trick to getting this right is identity. The members of the embedded team
    must have strong bonds of camaraderie with each other. They must feel like one
    team. They should treat their host teams with compassion and empathy, but they

    The incentive side can be covered by giving people a pathway to prestige and career
    advancement that complements the modernization effort. The only way to design
    communication pathways is actually to give people something to communicate about.
    In each case, we allow the vision for the new organization to reveal itself by
    designing structures that encourage new communication pathways to form in response
    to our modernization challenges. As the work continues, those communication pathways
    begin to solidify, and we can begin documentation and formalizing new teams or
    roles. In this way, we sidestep the anxiety of reorganizing. The workers determine
    where they belong based on how they adapt to problems; workers typically left
    out are given time and space to learn new skills or prove themselves in different
    roles, and by the time the new organization structure is ratified by leadership,
    everyone already has been working that way for a couple months.

    need to be developed or that to enforce good practices across the engineering
    organization, they need internal tooling. With this structure, we know some parts

    significantly different from the old system. When there’s that much change, technology
    and practices that are completely foreign to existing engineers usually are being
    introduced. Moving off mainframes, shutting down a data center in favor of the
    cloud, rolling out SRE, or incorporating orchestration are all examples of modernization
    challenges where there is likely to be a skills gap on the existing teams. The
    expert being injected to advise and assist will start the process of forming new
    teams by figuring out how the work the old team needs to do gets split up. For
    example, if the modernization effort involves a new piece of technology, not everyone
    on the team will need to reach the same proficiency level with it. Rather than
    a senior manager deciding who will go where, the organization lets the existing
    team work on it and sees who develops an aptitude.

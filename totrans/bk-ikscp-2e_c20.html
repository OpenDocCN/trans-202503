			</header>
			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="415"/>Business cards have a role of their own even in the age of virtual meetings.
They reflect your personality or that of your organization and present what you most want others to know or remember about you. 
Like in a three-line haiku, you have a limited space to make a clear, original, and memorable statement that may well have a longer life than your current website.</p>
			<p>
				Simplicity, limited space, and the need for the design to stand out: those criteria make a business card a good test
project for a vector editor as a design tool. Inkscape's toolset makes it perfect for the job—even though it is not the
best piece of software for creating designs to be printed on paper (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.8">18.8</a>).</p>
			<p>This tutorial shows two different business card designs. I'm not
inviting you to follow the steps exactly (unless you just want to learn the techniques). If
you plan to create a business card, look at more examples than these two, and play with Inkscape to combine the best
design tricks shown here with something original. Creativity cannot be taught, but it can be inspired. 
Inkscape will serve you whether you're being artistic or creating a perfectly traditional design.</p>
			<a id="section20.1"/><h2>
				20.1 <a id="416"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_416" title="416"/>Design 1: Simple Graphics</h2>
			<p>
				To start creating a business card, choose <span class="ui"><strong>New from Template</strong></span> from the <span class="ui"><strong>File</strong></span> menu, select <span class="ui"><strong>Business Card</strong></span> in the list, select the preferred size in the <span class="ui"><strong>Business card size</strong></span> list, and click <span class="ui"><strong>Create from template</strong></span>.
This opens a new Inkscape window with the properly sized business card canvas. The examples in this tutorial use the 90×50 mm size.</p>
			<p>
				Switch to the Text tool and create text objects for all
the text lines you will have on your card: name, position, address, phone, and so on (<a href="#fig20-1">Figure 20-1</a>). Make
them all independent objects (click and type each one separately) because you're going
to move them around a lot, trying different layouts. If you want to display a logo on your
card, import the logo file (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.2">18.2</a>). If your logo is only a low-resolution bitmap, you can trace it (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.5">18.5</a>) and manually clean up
the resulting paths, then delete the bitmap.</p>

			<h3>20.1.1 Choosing Fonts</h3>
			<p>The next step is choosing font(s) for your text objects. Use a font you like to help personalize your design.
If you're interested in graphic design, you likely have
a library of favorite fonts; otherwise, a few basic (but good) fonts usually
come with your operating system, and you can find many high-quality (and inexpensive) fonts online.</p>
			<p>
				I’ve chosen the free Gentium font (Available at<a href="https://software.sil.org/gentium/">https://software.sil.org/gentium/</a>.)  for this design, as it’s aesthetically pleasing and features broad Unicode coverage. 
After assigning the same font to all the text strings, play with their relative sizes 
using the Selector (<a href="#fig20-2">Figure 20-2</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig20-2"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t02-02.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 20-2: Fonts and sizes</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="417"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_417" title="417"/>Do different sizes of the same font look good together?
If they don’t, try using different fonts for different elements, but keep in mind that using more than two fonts may look disorganized in such a small design.</p>
			<p>
				To make Inkscape see a new font, just install it as you usually do in your operating
system (for example, on Windows, right-click the font file and choose <span class="ui"><strong>Install for all users</strong></span>) and restart Inkscape. The new font will be listed in the <span class="ui">Text and Font</span> dialog
as well as in the Text tool's drop-down list (<a href="c15.xhtml#section15.3.2">15.3.2</a>).</p>
			<a id="section20.1.2"/><h3>20.1.2 Layout</h3>
			<p>
				When making a template for multiple business cards (or other design items), you need to leave extra
space for variable-length names and addresses. However, I'm making a card only for myself, which frees me from this
requirement and allows me to position and align all text objects precisely. I was able to push all the address
bits closely against the name, creating an asymmetric composition tightly bound together
by its alignments (the address is aligned with the start of the last name, the email
with the top of the name, and so on), as shown in <a href="#fig20-3">Figure 20-3</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig20-3"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t02-03.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 20-3: Laying out the text</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				This layout looked interesting, but perhaps a little too rectangular. An obvious
thing to try was to select all (Ctrl-A) and rotate (press [
once). Much better! The design now has a flair of constructivism—a short-lived but
influentional design movement of the 1920s that espoused bold contrasts and text running at an angle. Let's develop this style further: add three black corners intruding into the composition from the
edges and place a big red circle in the center of the composition (<a href="#fig20-4">Figure 20-4</a>). Constructivists
loved simple geometric forms in black and red!</p>
			<a id="fig20-4"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t02-04.svg.png"/>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="418"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_418" title="418"/>To look their best, most text objects require letter spacing adjustments (uniform
spacing between all letters in the text) and kerning (intervals within specific letter pairs). In the Text tool, use the 
controls bar (<span class="ui"><strong>Spacing between letters</strong></span> and <span class="ui"><strong>Horizontal kerning</strong></span> numeric values) to adjust those parameters; for kerning, you could also use Alt-arrows to change the interval at the text cursor
(<a href="c15.xhtml#section15.4.4">15.4.4</a>). Generally, large text objects look better with tighter letter spacing, while
small type needs increased letter spacing for readability.</p>
			<a id="section20.2"/><h2>20.2 Design 2: Artistic Drawing</h2>
			<p>My first business card design was mostly inspired by the text lines’ layout, with
graphic elements coming secondary to support and reinforce that layout. You could do it the
other way around, starting with a graphic and building the design around it.</p>
			<p>
				For a company business card, the obvious starting point is the
logo. If you're designing a personal business card and want to it to be more personable,
add a photo that you can additionally trace (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.5">18.5</a>) and then tweak as vectors. You could also
use a piece of clipart (<a href="c01.xhtml#section1.3">1.3</a>) as a focal point of your design.</p>
			<p>
				For the second demo card, however, I chose another approach: artistic initials. I
switched to the Calligraphic pen, set the <span class="ui">Angle</span> to 90 degrees with a <span class="ui">Fixation</span> of 100 and
drew a couple of intertwined letters. I finally got the letter shapes more or less
right, but the result was at best mildly interesting. I tried to improve
it by unioning the path objects and then simplifying, insetting, and outsetting it a few times, as <a href="#fig20-5">Figure 20-5</a> demonstrates.</p>
			<a id="fig20-5"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t02-05.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 20-5: Creating initials</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Now the letters looked more natural, but I wanted to make them even more interesting. "Don't be too neat" is a viable design strategy; if you
can smear, distort, or damage your art in a creative way, go ahead and do it. With this approach in mind, I
selected a somewhat narrower pen nib, maximized <span class="ui">Tremor</span> to 100, and danced wildly around
the letters with my tablet pen (<a href="#fig20-6">Figure 20-6</a>). Using a mouse for this effect would work almost as well.
The result appeared unattractive at first because I forgot to apply the usual <span class="ui">Simplify/Inset/Outset</span> magic.</p>

			<h3>
				20.2.1 <a id="419"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_419" title="419"/>Layout</h3>
			<p>
				This piece of distortion art deserved the central place on the card,
with the rest placed symmetrically around it. I used a plain,
slanted, very light sans serif font (Helvetica Condensed Light) that doesn't distract
from the artwork in the center. The horizontal layout made the card seem cramped so I rotated
everything on its side (by pressing Ctrl-[) to give the art ample space and allow the text
to float to the edges and not interfere with the artwork, as shown in <a href="#fig20-7">Figure 20-7</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig20-7"/><figure>

			<a id="section20.2.2"/>
			<h3>20.2.2 Texture and Color</h3>
			<p>A pleasing design was starting to emerge, but it was far from ready. The card looked too empty, flat, and hostile
with the irregular blotch of ink in the center. To fix this, I decided to add some background gradients.</p>
			<p>
				As explained in <a href="c10.xhtml#section10.6">10.6</a>,
the default gradient from opacity 1 to opacity 0 of a given color (for example, blue) looks
crude, because its boundary is clearly visible upon white even when you use a pale color. To
improve the look of a gradient over a white background, paint the transparent end of the
gradient white, instead of the same color as the other end.</p>
			<p>
				Here, I added four rectangles with irregularly slanted bluish green gradients at the
edges of the card to achieve a softly blending, naturally bending, asymmetric look.
In <a href="#fig20-8">Figure 20-8</a>, the dashed lines are the bounding boxes of the four rectangles
with gradients, and the gradient lines show each gradient’s span and direction. I painted the initials dark
blue and added a blurred, 50 percent opaque drop shadow to the letters (<span class="ui">Filters<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Shadows and Glows<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Drop Shadow</span>).</p>

				<img alt="" src="tuts/t02-08.svg.png"/>

			</figure>
			<p><a id="420"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_420" title="420"/>To make it even prettier, I decided to add texture to the card by overlaying a
regular grid of semitransparent lines (<a href="#fig20-9">Figure 20-9</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig20-9"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t02-09.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 20-9: Adding a striped texture. The card is ready.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				To add texture,
I drew a rectangle over the entire card, opened <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> (Shift-Ctrl-F),
switched the fill to pattern, and chose the <span class="ui">Stripes 1:1 white</span> stock pattern.
Using pattern adjustment
handles in the Node tool (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.8.1">10.8.1</a>), I rotated the stripes and scaled them down. 
Finally, I stepped the rectangle in z-order above the gradients and the initials but below the
text, and reduced its opacity to 20 percent.</p>
			<a id="section20.3"/><h2>20.3 Export and Printing</h2>
			<p>If you’ve created a business card design and want to print it, first you’ll convert the file to PDF.</p>
			<p>
				Inkscape's PDF exporter (<a href="b02.xhtml#sectionB.3">B.3</a>) is mature and sophisticated enough to
render any design, be it this tutorial's first card (no transparency or gradients, a collection of fully opaque shapes) or the second one
(opacity, gradients, and even filters for the drop shadow on the initials). What needs to be rasterized will be rasterized, and text objects
will either have their fonts embedded or be converted to paths on export.</p>
			<p>If even PDF doesn't cut it, you can always just export an entire
design as a bitmap. Inkscape can export only as PNG, but any number of other programs will convert a PNG
to a different bitmap format, such as TIFF (old but still popular in the print world).</p>
			<a id="section20.3.1"/><h3>
				20.3.1 <a id="421"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_421" title="421"/>Using Device Colors</h3>
			<p>
				Sometimes a print service will require device-specific CMYK or spot colors (for example, a mandated spot color
for your company logo), rather than a PDF or TIFF file.
Although Inkscape provides some support for color-managed display, you can’t export anything except the RGB
screen color space into any output format. You’ll need to use external software to perform the color separation (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.8.3">18.8.3</a>).</p>
			<a id="section20.3.2"/><h3>20.3.2 Tiled Output</h3>
			<p>
				If you plan to print the business cards on an office or home printer, you will probably use A4 or
Letter paper with multiple copies per sheet that you cut into separate cards. To prepare a
printable file, group all of your card’s objects, then use the <span class="ui"><strong>Create Tiled Clones</strong></span>
dialog (<a href="c16.xhtml#section16.6">16.6</a>) to create, for example, a 2×5 grid of clones of the group that will fit on your
printable page (<a href="#fig20-10">Figure 20-10</a>).</p>

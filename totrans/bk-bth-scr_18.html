<p class="chapterintro">The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_1">for</span> command is easily the most indispensable and cardinal command in all of the Batch coding universe. Loops would be nearly impossible without it, and it comes in a number of forms with many options and keywords to perform varying and diverse tasks. This command commands its very own section of the book that you’re now holding.</p>
<p class="tx">If the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">for</span> command had no options at all, it would still be the most powerful command in Batch, and I’ll detail this optionless variant in <span class="xref"><a href="chapter17.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 17</a></span>. But the command also sports four incredibly impressive options. In <span class="xref"><a href="chapter18.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 18</a></span>, I’ll introduce the options that handle directories, recursion, and iterative loops. In <span class="xref"><a href="chapter19.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 19</a></span>, you’ll learn about the file reading option, which is actually a misnomer because it unlocks an awesome amount of functionality far beyond the reading of files. We'll finish up with a discussion on advanced techniques concerning the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">for</span> command in <span class="xref"><a href="chapter20.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 20</a></span>.</p>

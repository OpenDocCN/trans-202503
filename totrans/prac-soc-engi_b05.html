<p class="ChapterIntro">These exercises are things I normally implement when teaching in-person classes. They seek to help students overcome the fear of breaking the proverbial ice with targets and condition them to ask for potentially sensitive information in on-the-spot or uncomfortable positions. Feel free to do these as you have time, and watch as your social engineering aptitude and comfort levels rise.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500983b05-0001">Help a Random Stranger and Then Prompt for “Flags”</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">When you are out and about, look for strangers trying to take selfies. Offer to help them. If they accept, prompt them to help you with something. I like using “anthropology surveys” or “word surveys for psychology class,” and ask some invasive questions, like their mother’s maiden name or passwords. I have noticed that I have better success in asking for a mother’s maiden <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_202" title="202"/>name when phrasing it as “what was your mom’s name before she was married?” This tends to bypass the mental firewall rule about a mother’s maiden name.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500983b05-0002">Improv</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Improvisational comedy is great for getting better at thinking on your feet. When doing onsite physical assessments and vishing, you have to think on your feet. Nothing ever goes as planned. Having improv experience helps you get used to adapting to awkward situations, which can occur without warning in these engagements. Remember the rule of improv: never say no.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500983b05-0003">Standup Comedy</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Like improv, standup comedy helps with social engineering. The difference in the two disciplines is that one is rehearsed and the other is not. The benefit to standup comedy that improv lacks is that you have time to come up with your entire backstory in advance. But regular standup fails, and improv succeeds, when making stuff up on the fly. Both are important but give you different experiences. </p>
<h2 id="h1-500983b05-0004">Public Speaking/Toastmasters</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Speaking will always help. Getting comfortable in front of a group of varying sizes is to your advantage. Like doing improv, things will go wrong. You will have to work through and around the problems to succeed. You will also get used to communicating clearly and having more ways to convey a point. </p>
<p>For example, the first time I gave my “Social Forensication” talk was at BSides Orlando in 2018. Three slides into the presentation, my computer encountered a Blue Screen of Death. I panicked. After taking about 30 seconds to regain my composure, I explained the problem to the audience, and a friend came on stage and babysat my computer as it came back up. I was honest about this being my first time presenting the talk and explained that I was going to improvise from memory. The system came back up, and I was able to go through my slides to cover all my material in the allotted time. I had to cut out my demonstration but offered to do it in the hallway, and about 15 people came out to see it. Remarkably, that is not my worst speaking experience, just one that helped me grow.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500983b05-0005">Do OSINT Operations on Family and Friends</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Get permission from family and friends to collect OSINT on them. Depending on how close you are to them, you may be able to only refine your search methods and evaluate the fidelity of the data. I tend to solicit online friends I have never met in real life to make it a little more <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_203" title="203"/>challenging. To make it worthwhile for those who let us collect OSINT on them, provide a report of what you find. It doesn’t have to be formal or in the template from Appendix B, but it should be something that proves what you found, where you found it, why it is a problem, and how to have it removed (if possible).</p>
<h2 id="h1-500983b05-0006">Compete in Social Engineering and OSINT CTFs</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The final recommendation I have is to compete. Several people and organizations around the information security community orchestrate capture-the-flag (CTF) events. </p>
<p>Chris Hadnagy, who runs SEVillage at Defcon and as a standalone conference, has a social engineering CTF at both locations. Recon Village at Defcon and Defcon China have a CTF element. Chris Silvers runs OSINT CTFs at BSides Atlanta, GrrCON, NolaCon, and other conferences. When I do in-person training, I have an OSINT CTF element if the course is all day or more than a day. </p>
<p>Another platform is the Trace Labs Search Party CTF. Trace Labs runs multiple global remote CTFs and partners with a variety of conferences to run them there. They maintain a Slack channel and have ongoing operations for members of the Slack in which law enforcement has stated that they are seeking help. There are a variety of Discord servers for OSINT and social engineering, including mine (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://discord.com/invite/p78TTGa/">https://discord.com/invite/p78TTGa/</a>).</p>

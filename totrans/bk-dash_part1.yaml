- en: 'Dash builds on Python. While we don’t assume that you are a Python expert by
    any means, we expect that you have a solid understanding of basic Python concepts
    and syntax. In this part, we revisit the most relevant Python, PyCharm, and pandas
    information you need to get the most out of this book. If you find yourself struggling
    with the code, we’ve added a “Python Basics” appendix to help you improve your
    Python skills a little bit before reading on. For a more comprehensive introduction,
    feel free to check out the thorough Python crash courses and cheat sheets provided
    at the Finxter email academy: [*https://<wbr>blog<wbr>.finxter<wbr>.com<wbr>/email<wbr>-academy*](https://blog.finxter.com/email-academy).'

- en: If you feel confident in Python and pandas and have a preferred integrated development
    environment (IDE) to work with, feel free to jump right into [Chapter 4](chapter4.xhtml).
    If you feel you could use a quick revitalization of your Python and pandas skills
    or would like to set up the same Python IDE that is used throughout the book,
    keep reading!

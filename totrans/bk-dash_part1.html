<p class="PO">Dash builds on Python. While we don’t assume that you are a Python expert by any means, we expect that you have a solid understanding of basic Python concepts and syntax. In this part, we revisit the most relevant Python, PyCharm, and pandas information you need to get the most out of this book. If you find yourself struggling with the code, we’ve added a “Python Basics” appendix to help you improve your Python skills a little bit before reading on. For a more comprehensive introduction, feel free to check out the thorough Python crash courses and cheat sheets provided at the Finxter email academy: <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/email-academy"><i>https://<wbr/>blog<wbr/>.finxter<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/email<wbr/>-academy</i></a>.</p>
<p class="TX">If you feel confident in Python and pandas and have a preferred integrated development environment (IDE) to work with, feel free to jump right into <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a></span>. If you feel you could use a quick revitalization of your Python and pandas skills or would like to set up the same Python IDE that is used throughout the book, keep reading!</p>

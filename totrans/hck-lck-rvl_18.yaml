    why Cadence Health chose to represent which partners each patient belonged to
    as a string rather than a JSON array, which would have been cleaner. Once I figured
    out that they had made this choice, though, it was simple enough to work around.

    empty consultation notes created an account in the Cadence Health system but never

    its patients an average of $100,000 a day from $90 consultations alone. If AFLDS

    The drug that cumulatively cost patients the most was <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">IVERMECTIN
    3 MG TABLET</samp>, which was prescribed 63,409 times, at a total cost of $4.6
    million. Ivermectin is used primarily to treat parasites in livestock, but it’s
    also occasionally used to treat scabies and lice in humans. I didn’t know for
    sure that all of these ivermectin sales were directly from AFLDS, but it was suspicious
    that ivermectin was bringing in so much money during the COVID-19 pandemic, when
    disinformation about its efficacy was rampant.

    “birtherism” conspiracy theory about former US president Barack Obama’s citizenship.
    He was also caught up in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian
    interference in the 2016 election. The list of partners also includes individual
    doctors, including Dr. Zelenko of “Zelenko protocol” fame and Dr. Stella Immanuel,
    one of the AFLDS doctors from the previously mentioned press conference in front
    of the Supreme Court building. After that event, she quickly earned viral fame

    directly in Parler video metadata and plotted them on a map using Google Earth.
    In this case, however, I had only cities and states, so I needed to look up their
    GPS coordinates myself. I wrote a script to convert the names of the cities in
    the spreadsheet into GPS coordinates, a process called *geocoding*.

    came in and as the pandemic changed. When I published my findings in September

    list of 38,000 Gab user email addresses. I then wrote a Python script to load
    both lists and see if there were any email addresses in common. The script found
    several matches. I started looking through the Gab timeline of each match to see
    if I could find references to AFLDS, specifically to receiving medication, and
    found the verification I was looking for.

    store that sells ivermectin paste for livestock, asking, “Should I pick some up?”
    Two days later they posted an update: “All sold out!” The day after that, they
    posted a comment saying, “Front line doctors finally came through with HCQ/Zinc

    of an obvious way to authenticate it with OSINT like I did for the Cadence Health
    data. Instead, I found the phone number for Ravkoo CEO Alpesh Patel and gave him
    a call. After I informed him that I was a journalist, that Ravkoo had been breached,
    and that I had all its prescription records, his immediate response was, “That
    can’t be right. Our platform is secure.” After I emailed him the screenshot of
    Ravkoo’s Super Admin interface, though, I could hear the panic in his voice. “That’s
    a breach in HIPAA, so I have to report that first,” he said, referring to the
    US health care privacy law. “That’s an even more serious issue than your journalism.”

    was being used by AFLDS. “I’m totally flabbergasted. I had to look up exactly
    who these people were,” he said. “I’m fully vaccinated. My children are fully
    vaccinated. I’m trying to make heads and tails of this right now.” After I spoke
    with him, Espinal told me he immediately cut off service from SpeakWithAnMD. “I
    don’t want to be associated with any crap like that. None of that quackery that’s
    going on.”

    AFLDS, SpeakWithAnMD, and “16 different attorneys.” He told me that he said, “I’m
    ending my contract with you guys immediately,” and disconnected from the meeting.
    SpeakWithAnMD’s telehealth system went down that day, and AFLDS patients couldn’t
    pay for $90 consultations for a full week (saving them an estimated $700,000 on
    bogus consultations during that time).

    was paid a total of $17,500 for providing service to SpeakWithAnMD (he showed
    me the invoices he’d sent). The latter company went on to rake in millions of
    dollars with the help of the services Cadence provided.

    nor Cadence Health has followed this rule, and at the time of writing, patients

    Coronavirus Crisis launched an investigation into AFLDS and SpeakWithAnMD based
    on my reporting, as well as reporting on AFLDS by Vera Bergengruen for *Time*
    magazine. The committee’s chair, Rep. James Clyburn, wrote letters to AFLDS founder
    Simone Gold and to Jerome Corsi, owner of SpeakWithAnMD’s parent company, demanding
    detailed records from both companies. These included documents related to ownership,
    organizational structure, and staffing; details about the doctors’ training and
    qualifications; numbers of patients and what they were prescribed; and descriptions
    of the companies’ total revenue and net income for each quarter.

    in proven treatments and prevention measures and hindered efforts to control the
    pandemic,” Clyburn wrote in his letter to AFLDS. “Some Americans who have been
    influenced by misinformation have chosen not to get vaccinated, delayed receiving
    evidence-based treatment, and ingested unapproved substances in harmful quantities.”
    Clyburn also wrote a letter to the Federal Trade Commission requesting that the
    agency investigate whether these companies are in violation of federal laws.

    by SpeakWithAnMD, Clyburn expanded the committee’s investigation to include Cadence
    Health as well. Unfortunately, nothing more resulted from Congress’s investigation
    into AFLDS, SpeakWithAnMD, and Cadence Health.

    $83 a month, designed to entirely replace evidence-based health care. “If you
    are reading this email, you are aware that there is overwhelming evidence that

    As she prepared to serve two months in prison for storming the Capitol on January
    6, 2021, she resigned from her position on the AFLDS board, staying on as a well-paid
    consultant. While she was behind bars, leaders at AFLDS conducted an audit of
    her use of the group’s charity funds. AFLDS had received at least $10 million
    in donations, *in addition* to all of the money it had scammed out of patients.

    filed in November 2022 against Gold by Gilbert and other AFLDS board members,
    Gold lived rent-free with John Strand, her boyfriend who had stormed the Capitol
    with her, in a $3.6 million mansion purchased using AFLDS charity funds. The lawsuit
    also alleged that she was spending $12,000 a month on a bodyguard, $5,600 a month
    for a housekeeper, and $50,000 a month on credit card expenses—all AFLDS’s money.
    Furthermore, it accused her of purchasing three cars, including a Mercedes-Benz,
    and taking unauthorized private jet flights, including a single trip that cost
    $100,000, with AFLDS money.

    Gilbert claimed that Gold used the Naples mansion to house GoldCare employees
    and that she enlisted AFLDS employees to work for GoldCare while on the AFLDS
    payroll. For her part, Gold accused the AFLDS leaders of destroying her nonprofit,
    demanding that they resign. “Just as the mother lioness will not let her baby
    lion be murdered, neither will I,” Gold wrote in an email to them, according to
    an affidavit in the lawsuit.

    the employees out of their email, pressured an employee to hand over the password
    to the group’s Telegram account with hundreds of thousands of followers, and took
    control over the AFLDS website. There, she posted press releases claiming that,
    while she had discussed resigning from her position, those discussions “were never
    legally actualized” and asserting that she’s the legitimate leader of AFLDS. Gold
    wrote in an email to AFLDS supporters that “the allegations are cetegorically
    [*sic*] false,” and that “under my leadership, AFLDS will never tolerate corruption,
    no matter the personal price.” At the time of publication, the ultimate fate of
    AFLDS is still unknown, but Gold appears to control the reins.

    anonymous hacker into a groundbreaking report on AFLDS. That report resulted in
    a congressional investigation and contributed to the demise of a corrupt network
    of telehealth companies that profited off the COVID-19 pandemic. I explained exactly
    how I went about investigating the Cadence Health and Ravkoo datasets, all in
    JSON and CSV format. You also read through the Python code I wrote to answer specific
    questions about the data and to convert it into formats that I could visualize—all
    skills that you can use in your own data-heavy investigations. I explained how

    and descending into chaos in the aftermath.

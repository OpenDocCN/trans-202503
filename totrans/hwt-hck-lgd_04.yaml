    check out its user-facing internet presence and dig out some hidden subdomains.
    A quick Google search reveals that Strat Jumbo Inc. is a London-based company
    with around 800 employees, mainly backend programmers, spread across 10 countries.
    This is a company with enough potential targets to ensure a significant return
    on investment should we conduct a phishing campaign. We can already imagine seductive
    lures for such a crowd: a new Chrome extension, a corporate poll on C# versus
    Java, beta access to a new feature, and so forth.'

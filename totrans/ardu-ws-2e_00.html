			<p class="ChapterIntro">Have you ever looked at some gadget and wondered how it <em>really</em> worked? Maybe it was a remote control boat, an elevator, a vending machine, or an electronic toy. Or have you wanted to create your own robot or make electronic signals for a model railroad? Or perhaps you’d like to capture and analyze weather data over time? Where and how do you start?</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				The Arduino microcontroller board (shown in <a href="#figure1-1" id="figureanchor1-1">Figure 1-1</a>) can help you find the answers to some of the mysteries of electronics in a hands-on way. The original creation of Massimo Banzi and David Cuartielles, the Arduino system offers an inexpensive way to build interactive projects, such as remote-controlled robots, GPS tracking systems, and electronic games.</p>&#13;
			<p>The Arduino project has grown exponentially since its introduction in 2005. It’s now a thriving industry, supported by a community of people united with the common bond of creating something new. You’ll find individuals and groups ranging from small clubs to local hackerspaces to educational institutions, all interested in trying to make things with the Arduino.</p>&#13;

			<p>To get a sense of the variety of Arduino projects in the wild, simply search the internet. There, you’ll find an incredible number of projects, blogs, experiences, and ideas that show what is possible with the Arduino.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="h1-500587c01-0001">The Possibilities Are Endless</h2>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">A quick scan through this book will show you that you can use the Arduino to do something as simple as blinking a small light or something as complicated as interacting with a cellular phone—and many different things in between.</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				For example, look at Becky Stern’s Wi-Fi Weather Display, different examples of which are shown in <a href="#figure1-2" id="figureanchor1-2">Figure 1-2</a>. It uses an Arduino-compatible board with a Wi-Fi interface to receive the local weather forecast.  It then displays the daily maximum temperature and illuminates a colored triangle to represent the weather forecast for the day.</p>&#13;

				</figcaption>&#13;
			</figure>&#13;
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_3" title="3"/>Thanks to the ease of interrogating various internet-based information services, you can use this to display data other than the weather. For more information, visit <a class="LinkURL" href="https://www.instructables.com/id/WiFi-Weather-Display-With-ESP8266/">https://www.instructables.com/id/WiFi-Weather-Display-With-ESP8266/</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				How about reproducing a classic computer from the past? Thanks to the power of the Arduino’s internal processor, you can emulate computers from days gone by. One example is Oscar Vermeulen’s KIM Uno, shown in <a href="#figure1-3" id="figureanchor1-3">Figure 1-3</a>, which emulates the 1976 KIM-1 computer. Visit <a class="LinkURL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIM-1">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIM-1</a> to learn more.</p>&#13;

			<p>&#13;
				By building this project, the user can gain an understanding of how the first microprocessors worked, and this will give them the foundational knowledge to understand the computers of today. You can reproduce the Kim Uno for less than $50, and this low price tag makes this project an ideal tool to share with others with a technological interest.

			<p>&#13;
				Then there’s Michalis Vasilakis, who also enjoys making his own tools on a budget. A great example is his Arduino Mini CNC Plotter. This project uses an Arduino, mechanisms from old CD drives, and other inexpensive items to create a computer numerical control (CNC) device that can draw with precision on a flat surface (see <a href="#figure1-4" id="figureanchor1-4">Figure 1-4</a>).

			<p>These are only a few random examples of what is possible using an Arduino. You can create your own simple projects without much difficulty—and after you’ve worked through this book, even more complex projects will certainly be within your reach.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="h1-500587c01-0002">Strength in Numbers</h2>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">If you’re more of a social learner and enjoy class-oriented situations, search the web for a local hackerspace or enthusiasts’ group to see what people are making and to find Arduino-related groups. Members of Arduino groups can do such things as introduce the world of Arduino from an artist’s perspective or work together to create a small Arduino-compatible board. These groups can be a lot of fun, introduce you to interesting people, and let you share your Arduino knowledge with others.</p>&#13;

			<p class="BodyFirst">As with any other electronic device, the Arduino is available from many retailers offering a range of products and accessories. When you’re shopping, be sure to purchase the original Arduino, or a quality derivative. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_5" title="5"/>Otherwise, you run the risk of receiving faulty or poorly performing goods. Why risk your project with an inferior board that could end up costing you more in the long run? For a list of authorized Arduino distributors, visit <a class="LinkURL" href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Buy/">http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Buy/</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>Here’s a list of current suppliers (in alphabetical order) that I recommend for your purchases of Arduino-related parts and accessories:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;

All the required parts are easily available from the various resellers listed above, as well as other retailers you may already be familiar with.</p>&#13;
			<p>But don’t go shopping yet. Take the time to read the first few chapters to get an idea of what you’ll need so that you won’t waste money buying unnecessary things.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="h1-500587c01-0004">Required Software</h2>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">You should be able to program your Arduino with just about any computer. You’ll begin by installing a piece of software called an <em>integrated development environment (IDE)</em>. To run this software, your computer should have an internet connection and one of the following operating systems installed:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>macOS 10.14 64-bit, or higher</li>&#13;
				<li>Windows 10 Home 32- or 64-bit, or higher</li>&#13;
				<li>Linux 32- or 64-bit (Ubuntu or similar)</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				The IDE has been a work in progress since 2005 and is currently up to version 2.<em>x</em> (the exact number may change, but the instructions in this book should still work). Compared to version 1.<em>x</em>, version 2.<em>x</em> has some features that make writing and editing sketches easier, including interactive autocomplete, improved navigation through sketches, and more user-friendly board and library managers. Furthermore, a live debugger allows you to start and stop your Arduino sketch interactively when used with certain Arduino boards. However, if you’re new to the world of Arduino, you don’t need to worry about these features. Just remember that the Arduino team and community are always working on improvements.</p>&#13;
			<p>Now is a good time to download and install the IDE, so jump to the heading that matches your operating system and follow the instructions. Make sure you have or buy the matching USB cable for your Arduino from the supplier as well. Even if you don’t have your Arduino board yet, you can still download and explore the IDE.</p>&#13;

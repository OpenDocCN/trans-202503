- en: This book is an introduction to cybersecurity, written to help system and network
    administrators and owners understand the fundamentals of securing a network. Your
    personal cybersecurity is critical in protecting yourself from fraud and other
    harmful events attempted by adversaries. It’s easy to tell yourself that you can’t
    be a target, that you have nothing an adversary would want to use or exploit.
    However, your personal identifiable information (PII), protected health information
    (PHI), intellectual property, and government information and identification all
    have value. Failing to protect those things can lead to consequences such as identify
    theft, which can have a serious impact on your life.

- en: For our purposes, a small network consists of 100 or fewer *endpoints*. An endpoint,
    or *host*, is any system or device that connects to or is part of a network, such
    as a desktop or laptop computer or a mobile device like a phone or tablet. Larger
    networks, approaching the size of an enterprise network, use similar tools and
    techniques that are covered in this book to provide security to their users and
    systems, just on a much larger scale and often at a much higher cost.

- en: The drawback to securing small networks is that you have to maintain and administer
    everything yourself, with limited support and likely a limited budget. Securing
    your network will require constant care, and we’ll cover some ways that you can
    do this cheaply when the need arises. Ultimately, the goal of this book is to
    arm you with the tools and knowledge to secure your network with whatever resources
    you have available, in terms of both time and money.

- en: This book is written so that if you follow it logically from chapter to chapter,
    you’ll progress through several levels of security maturity, ending with a network
    that has a *defense-in-depth* architecture. Defense-in-depth is an approach to
    cybersecurity where several defensive solutions are layered to protect valuable
    data and information. [Chapters 1 to 4](nsp-enoka501485-0010.xhtml#ch01) cover
    how to design and architect your network to better enable your defenses and network
    monitoring capabilities. Then, [Chapters 5 to 8](nsp-enoka501485-0014.xhtml#ch05)
    discuss low-cost, high-impact passive defense strategies to prevent adversaries
    from gaining access to your network or endpoints. Finally, [Chapters 9 to 11](nsp-enoka501485-0018.xhtml#ch09)
    focus on the value of regular backups and active defenses, whereby you receive
    and respond to alerts to suspicious or malicious activity in your network, enabling
    cyber incident response.

- en: Most chapters contain stand-alone projects. You can choose to complete each
    project in order, or you can pick and choose which projects you want to complete.
    However, the concepts covered in earlier chapters on network architecture provide
    the best return on investment, in terms of both time and money, and require less
    ongoing support and maintenance. The later chapters that cover active defenses
    require constant monitoring and are made more efficient with the completion of
    earlier projects. In some cases, working through the projects in earlier chapters
    also provides baseline knowledge that may be useful in later projects, such as
    familiarity with the command line. Essentially, you should complete each chapter
    in whichever order makes the most sense for you and your environment; for example,
    if you already have host and network firewalls in place, you can probably skip
    [Chapter 3](nsp-enoka501485-0012.xhtml#ch03).

    setting off on your own adventure. It covers two fundamental topics: setting up
    the servers you’ll use throughout the book and creating a network map and asset
    list. Before you can secure your network, you need to understand its *topology*:
    which hosts are connected to it and how they connect to each other. Mapping the
    topology will help you keep track of your devices and recognize unusual activity
    on the network. It’s expected that the vast majority of readers will implement
    the projects contained in this book as virtual machines (VMs). *Virtual machines*
    (which are also endpoints!) let you run multiple computers using one physical
    computer. Using VMs is a cheaper and easier way to achieve the same results with
    fewer hardware requirements. (I’ll describe the remaining hardware recommendations
    in the section “[Recommended Hardware](nsp-enoka501485-0009.xhtml#ahintro03).”)'

    securing small networks. The book will guide you through all of the necessary
    steps to complete each chapter and project at a very low level. Having previous
    experience working with virtual machines, using the command line, and generally
    managing or administering a network of any size will prove beneficial. Having
    said that, you should be able to follow along regardless of experience, as you’ll
    learn the necessary skills as you progress.

    as that physical computer has enough memory (RAM) and processor (CPU) resources.
    As a general rule, you’ll need 2GB of memory and one CPU core for each VM you
    plan to run, plus at least 4GB of memory and one CPU core for the host operating
    system. Therefore, to complete every chapter of this book, you should plan to
    use a physical system with at least 16GB of RAM and eight CPU cores.

    use network attached storage (NAS) or another system capable of running virtual
    machines, or a small computing unit such as an Intel NUC, in the same way. A NAS
    is a device connected to your network that allows storage and retrieval of data
    from a central location and in most cases will offer additional network services
    and capabilities, like the ability to host virtual machines. If you have spare
    resources on your computer, start there. You can always move your virtual machines
    to a new system if they outgrow their original host and its hardware.

    and configuration of a pfSense firewall. This firewall can be purchased cheaply,
    and it will go a long way in increasing the security of any network very quickly
    and with minimal effort. The recommended device is the Netgate SG-3100 as it’s
    cost-effective and easy to set up and maintain. It is possible to build your own,
    but the Netgate will likely be more secure and have a better cost.

    this book. This router is a mid-range device in terms of price and features. It
    provides enterprise-grade functionality without the premium price tag.

    two points on a network, allowing you to collect network traffic as it travels
    between devices as well as networks. You can analyze captured traffic to identify
    suspicious or malicious behavior and then tailor your defenses to prevent or alert
    on that activity, providing the best chance to prevent cybersecurity incidents.
    Dualcomm offers several TAPs with varying capabilities, capacities, and price
    points. For most small networks, the ETAP-2003 will be sufficient; this is the
    device we’ll focus on.

    and they offer commercial support.

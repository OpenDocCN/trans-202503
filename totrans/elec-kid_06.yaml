- en: Remember, LEDs are polarized, and they must be connected the right way to work.
    Connect the long leg of the LED to row 8, where the resistor leg is connected.
    Because the resistor and LED legs are on the same row, they’re now connected.
    Connect the other leg of the LED to row 10.

    the red wire at row 1 and the black wire at row 10\. Plug your battery into the
    clip, and your LED should light up!

    the battery when making changes to your circuit. Then, check whether the short
    leg of the LED is connected to the negative side of the battery.

- en: If your LED is still not working once it’s oriented correctly, check that your
    components are connected exactly as described in Steps 1 through 3\. Are the long
    leg of the LED and one of your resistor’s legs in row 8? Is the positive battery
    lead in the same row as the other resistor leg? Is the negative battery lead in
    row 10 with the short LED leg? Ask someone else to have a look at your circuit,
    too; maybe they can help you find the problem.

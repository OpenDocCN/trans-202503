    yet they are almost as fundamental as the air we breathe. You almost certainly
    arrived where you are now via a road, and one will likely take you wherever you
    go next. The first roadways in history were formed as people or animals followed
    the same trail long enough to erode a path between two points. They have always
    existed in some form, but they haven’t always been safe, comfortable, or able
    to accommodate the enormous number and weight of vehicles that use our present
    system of roadways every day. Over the years, the demands on streets and highways
    have only increased as more people and goods are on the move. Their designs have
    evolved alongside this demand. It may not always seem so, but roads now carry
    more and heavier vehicles than they ever have in history. With their omnipresence,
    their value to society is easy to forget. But the engineers, contractors, and
    public works crews who study, design, construct, and maintain our roadways know
    how important they are in moving goods and transporting people. Whether or not
    you love how much roads dominate the landscape, you have to marvel at the fact
    that, in most parts of the modern world, anyone can take a bus, car, bike, truck,
    motorcycle, or scooter to go almost anywhere else with relative ease and comfort.

- en: Nothing has had a more significant impact on the planning and design of cities
    in the past 100 years than the automobile. With their explosion in popularity
    in the early 20th century, motor vehicles became the standard mode of urban transportation.
    And with that, cities needed roads to accommodate the growing volume of traffic.
    There are a lot of good analogies between cities and human anatomy, and roadways
    are no exception. In fact, roads are often referred to by their cardiovascular
    equivalents. Highways are like the aorta with a high capacity and single major
    destination. Small collector roads are like capillaries with not much capacity
    but a connection to every individual house and business. In between are the aptly
    named arterial roadways, the medium-capacity connections between urban centers.
    All together, they form an urban transportation network allowing vehicles to travel
    (somewhat) efficiently between any two places on the map.

    for more than just automobiles. Collectors and arterial roadways truly make up
    the city’s circulatory system, providing a path for cars, trucks, buses, bicycles,
    pedestrians, utility lines, and even stormwater runoff. Although every street
    is different, most urban roadways share many of the same features. This section
    provides an overview of the most common elements you might see in your city.
  prefs: []

- en: One way to characterize roadways is how they cross, also known as *intersections*.
    Collectors and arterial roads commonly overlap *at grade*, in other words, on
    the ground at the same level. That means only a few traffic streams can pass through
    simultaneously, resulting in an interrupted flow of traffic. These intersections
    are also where a vast majority of crashes occur. For those reasons, traffic engineers
    put much thought and analysis into the design of intersections and how to make
    them as safe and efficient as possible. This challenge almost always requires
    a compromise of numerous conflicting considerations, including space, cost, types
    and volumes of traffic, and human factors like habits, expectations, and reaction
    times. The simplest intersections are sign-controlled, using stop or yield signs
    to manage the flow of traffic. They are cost-effective and don’t require any extra
    space, but they can’t handle high volumes because they create an interruption
    for every vehicle passing through. Signal-controlled intersections use electric
    lights to indicate which traffic can proceed. (Traffic signals are covered in
    detail later in the book.) Roundabouts are circular intersections that keep traffic
    flowing around a central island. Although they sometimes take up more space than
    other types of junctions, they have some distinct advantages. Roundabouts handle
    traffic efficiently by avoiding the start and stop of interrupted flow, and they
    create fewer dangerous collisions because of the slower speeds and single direction
    of traffic. Of course, within these three basic categories exist an endless array
    of intersection configurations. If you drive long enough, you will see the wide
    variety of intersection types and layouts used by engineers to keep roadway traffic
    flowing safely and efficiently.

    and parking lanes as well. The roadway’s surface is usually crowned in the center
    with a slope toward the outer edges to shed rainwater off the driving surface.
    At the outer edges, curbs separate the pavement from the developed area, and gutters
    provide a channel for rainwater to travel. Many cities and towns include a narrow
    strip between the road and sidewalk to provide a safety buffer between fast-moving
    vehicles and vulnerable pedestrians. This area has many regional names, including
    curb strip, *verge*, and *berm*. It also provides a location for utility poles,
    signs, and streetlamps.

- en: Unfortunately, pavement is not invincible. One of the most common frustrations
    of city driving is the pothole. They’re annoying, yes, but they’re more than that.
    Potholes cause billions of dollars of damage to tires, shocks, and wheels of vehicles.
    Even worse, they’re dangerous. Cars swerve to miss them, sometimes at high speeds,
    and if a bike, motorcycle, or scooter hits one, it can be bad news for the rider.
    The formation of a pothole happens in steps, the first of which is deterioration
    of the surface pavement. They might seem innocuous, but cracks are critical flaws
    in a pavement system because they let in water. Soil below the pavement can become
    waterlogged from precipitation, softening and weakening the subgrade. Water below
    the roadway can also freeze and grow into a formation called an ice lens. Water
    expands when it freezes, and it does so with tremendous force, separating the
    subgrade and pavement. When those lenses thaw out, the ice that was supporting
    the pavement recedes, creating voids. Every time a tire hits this soft area, it
    pushes some of the water and underlying soil back out of the pavement. It’s a
    slow process at first, but every little bit of subgrade eroded from beneath the
    pavement means less support, and less support means more volume below the pavement
    for water to be pumped in and out by traffic. Eventually, the pavement loses enough
    support that it fails, breaking off and creating a pothole.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Because potholes are so destructive and inconvenient, roadway owners spend
    a lot of time and money both trying to prevent them from forming and fixing them
    when they appear. Prevention mainly involves sealing cracks against water intrusion.
    Repairs can be wide-ranging depending on the materials, cost, and climate conditions.
    But they all mostly do the same thing: replace the soil and pavement that was
    lost and (hopefully) seal the area off from further water intrusion. If the pothole
    repair does not create a good connection with the rest of the roadway, a pothole
    can recur in the same location.'

    past 100 years or so, they seem to have been the principal consideration in every
    part of the planning and design of cities. Unfortunately, this car-centric approach
    deprives all the other users of urban roadways, including pedestrians and cyclists.
    In many places, if you try getting around town in anything other than a personal
    automobile, you’ll face a string of inconveniences and dangers along the way.

- en: One of the most apparent pedestrian accommodations is the sidewalk, a narrow
    path generally separated from the street. These footpaths can be made from many
    materials, but they are ribbons of concrete in most cities. Sidewalks may appear
    simple, but considerable engineering is present in their design and construction.
    The cracking of concrete is inevitable. Tree roots invade the subsurface, cycles
    of freeze and thaw lift the soil, and vehicles impose unanticipated loads. Sidewalks
    are designed with control joints to constrain the cracks’ location to a regular
    pattern by artificially weakening the concrete. These induced cracks are preferential
    to the unsightly random arrangement that would otherwise occur. Also, concrete
    shrinks and expands according to temperature. On small structures, this may be
    imperceptible, but for long shapes (like sidewalks), the thermal movement can
    add up. Occasional spaces, called expansion joints, are left in the concrete to
    prevent sidewalks from buckling or having significant gaps. The joints are typically
    filled with wood, cork, or rubber to allow for movement over time.

    pedestrian facilities safe and efficient for all users, including those with disabilities.
    Sidewalks have specific minimum widths and slopes to make sure they’re not too
    challenging to traverse. Where a sidewalk meets a curb, it often includes a ramp
    down to the street’s surface. This ramp is called a curb cut, and it ensures that
    users of wheelchairs, walkers, and canes can easily transition onto the path.
    It also helps pedestrians pushing carts or strollers and even children on bicycles.
    In addition, sidewalks often feature tactile pavement. These bumpy areas help
    people with visual disabilities delineate the boundary between sidewalk and road.
    They are detectable warnings for those who might not otherwise be able to identify
    a potential hazard, including subway lines, steep grades, stairs, and road crossings.
    They often have a contrasting color so they’re easy to recognize, and many use
    a familiar texture called truncated domes.'

- en: Another critical aspect of pedestrian infrastructure is to allow those on foot
    to cross streets safely. Crosswalks are designated areas for pedestrians to cross
    a road, making them more visible and predictable to motorists. They are usually
    located at intersections and marked with large white bars. When a junction has
    a traffic signal, lights at either end of each crosswalk show pedestrians when
    to cross. Some pedestrian signals even include a countdown timer to show how many
    seconds are remaining to cross. Depending on the traffic volume, the crossing
    signal may be simultaneous with the green light for vehicle traffic, or there
    may be a phase when only pedestrians are allowed to move. Some lights stagger
    the phases, so pedestrians get a head start from drivers. Some signals operate
    exclusively on a preprogrammed timer, while others are actuated with a call button
    at the sidewalk. Even if the switch is present, that doesn’t necessarily mean
    it’s connected to the signal controller. Sometimes these buttons are simply *placebos*,
    or work only during certain times of the day.

    but biking in a city without dedicated cycling infrastructure often feels life-threatening.
    Most places have laws allowing bikes to use the same travel lanes as motor vehicles,
    but few cyclists feel comfortable doing so except on the least busy streets. There
    are many different approaches to accommodating bicycle traffic in cities. One
    of the most straightforward measures is the sharrow, a symbol used to mark the
    preferred path for cyclists on shared travel lanes. *Uniformity* is a crucial
    concept in traffic engineering. If all road users know what to expect, they are
    less likely to make errors in judgment that lead to collisions. Sharrows don’t
    explicitly provide protection or separation for cyclists, but they help establish
    expectations between motorists and bicyclists to avoid confusion (and hopefully
    tension) on the road.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next step up in bicycling infrastructure is the painted bike lane. These
    dedicated paths don’t provide physical division from vehicles. Still, they visually
    separate the primary travel lanes, creating a perceptual division between the
    two streams of traffic (which often have very different prevailing speeds). Bike
    lines sometimes feature green paint in the United States to further distinguish
    them from the rest of the road, and they occasionally include painted buffers
    to create more space between vehicles and cyclists.
  prefs: []

    of all abilities. These are exclusive cycling paths with a physical barrier of
    some kind from the main roadway. Of course, separate and dedicated tracks require
    significant investment, so they are often reserved for only the most highly trafficked
    routes.
  prefs: []

- en: One way to make pedestrians and cyclists safer is to reduce motor vehicles’
    speed and volume. Changing the posted speed limit is usually not enough to slow
    down cars, so engineers and city planners employ more creative methods of traffic
    calming. At intersections, reducing the curb radius can slow down vehicles making
    turns and shorten the crossing distance for pedestrians. However, doing so is
    feasible only in areas without much truck traffic (since they need more room to
    turn). Calming options away from intersections include neckdowns to constrict
    the roadway width, chicanes to add gentle turns, trees to reduce the sight distance,
    and speed humps to provide a physical impediment to fast-moving vehicles.

- en: Traffic management in dense urban areas is a complex problem with a host of
    conflicting goals and challenges. One of the most fundamental of those challenges
    happens at an intersection where multiple traffic streams—including motor vehicles,
    bikes, and pedestrians—need to cross one another’s paths safely and efficiently.
    One of the most common ways we control the *right of way* at intersections is
    the traffic signal. Using signals isn’t a panacea for all traffic problems, but
    they offer a balance of many essential considerations, namely their minimal space
    requirements and ability to handle large volumes of traffic with only minor interruptions.

- en: Intersections need to be rigidly standardized so that when you come to an unfamiliar
    one, you already know your role in the careful and chaotic dance of vehicles and
    pedestrians. That’s why almost all traffic signals in a specific area or country
    look similar. In their simplest form, traffic signals are a set of three lights
    facing each lane of an intersection. The lights hang from suspended cables or
    rigid support structures. In general, when the light is green, the vehicles in
    that lane are permitted to cross. When the light is red, they aren’t. The amber
    light warns that the signal is about to change from green to red. Beyond this
    primary function, traffic signals can take on innumerable complexities to accommodate
    all kinds of situations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'At each approach to the intersection, vehicles can go in one of three directions,
    which are called *movements*: right, through, or left. Right and through are usually
    grouped as a single movement, so a typical four-way intersection has two vehicle
    and one pedestrian movement for each direction. These movements can be grouped
    into phases of the traffic signal. For example, the left-turn movements on opposite
    approaches can be grouped into a single phase because they can go simultaneously
    without conflicts. Traffic engineers determine the grouping of movements into
    phases and the order of each phase through a signal cycle to accommodate different
    volumes and types of traffic.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another critical decision is how long each sequence of a phase should last.
    Ideally, a green light should last at least long enough to clear the queue built
    up during the red light, but it isn’t always possible, especially during peak
    times on busy intersections. In cases where the junction is saturated, the green
    light might be extended to reduce the number of cycles since each one includes
    startup and clearance times—the periods when the intersection isn’t being utilized
    to its maximum capacity.
  prefs: []

- en: The amber light needs to last long enough for drivers to perceive the warning
    and decelerate their vehicles to a stop at a comfortable rate. Design guidelines
    consider many factors, but the duration of the amber light is usually set to around
    one second for every 10 miles per hour or 16 kilometers per hour on the speed
    limit. In most places in North America, you are allowed to enter an intersection
    for the entire duration of a yellow light, which means there needs to be a time
    when all phases have a red light to allow the junction to clear. This clearance
    interval is usually about one second, but it can be adjusted up or down based
    on the speed limit and intersection size.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some traffic signals use a set timing sequence programmed into the controller,
    but many are more sophisticated than that. *Actuated signal control* is the term
    we use for traffic lights that can receive input from the outside to adjust timing
    and phase sequence on the fly. Actuated signals rely on data from traffic-detection
    systems that can be video cameras, radar detectors, or inductive loop sensors
    embedded into the road surface. These latter sensors are essentially large metal
    detectors that can measure whether a car or truck is present (to the annoyance
    of bicycles, scooters, and motorcycles that are sometimes too small to trigger
    the loop). Whatever the type of sensor, they all feed data into an equipment cabinet
    located nearby. You’ve probably seen hundreds of these cabinets without realizing
    their purpose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inside this cabinet is a traffic signal controller, a simple computer programmed
    with logic to determine when and how long each phase will last based on the information
    from the detectors. Actuated control gives a traffic signal much more flexibility
    to handle variations in traffic load. For example, if a nearby road is closed
    and traffic is rerouted through an intersection that doesn’t usually see such
    high demand, it may need to be reprogrammed before the closure. A traffic signal
    equipped with actuated control will simply see the additional traffic and adjust
    its phasing accordingly. The same is true with special events, like concerts and
    sports games, that create colossal traffic demands on irregular schedules. Actuated
    systems can also keep you from waiting at a long light when no one’s crossing
    in the other direction. Finally, actuated control can help prioritize emergency
    and public transportation vehicles equipped with specialized transmitters. Infrared
    or acoustic preemption devices communicate with transmitters on each prioritized
    vehicle to send the signal controller a call for green.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Actuated control isn’t the pinnacle of signal complexity. After all, it still
    treats each intersection as an isolated entity when it is actually one component
    of a larger traffic network. Each element of the traffic network can have an impact
    on other parts of the system. The classic example of this is *gridlock*, where
    queues of vehicles block adjacent intersections in a way that brings the flow
    of traffic to a standstill. One solution to this problem is *signal coordination*,
    where lights can work in synchronization with each other. Coordinated signals
    are employed on long corridors with small but frequent cross streets. The signals
    on the major road are timed so that a large group of vehicles, called a *platoon*
    by traffic engineers, can make it some or all of the way through the corridor
    without interruption. This coordination can significantly increase the volume
    of traffic able to pass through intersections, but it works only on stretches
    of road that don’t have other sources of traffic interruptions like driveways
    and businesses. If the platoon can’t stick together, the benefits of coordinating
    signals are reduced.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The obvious next step in efficiency is coordinating most or all of the signals
    within a traffic network. This is the job of *adaptive signal control technologies*.
    In adaptive systems, rather than individual groups of lights, all the information
    from detectors is fed into a centralized system (often wirelessly with antennas
    at each signal) that can use advanced algorithms to optimize traffic flow throughout
    the city. These systems can dramatically reduce congestion, and many cities have
    implemented adaptive technologies for their traffic signals.

    uniformity of signs and markings. Motorists moving at rapid speeds must make snap
    decisions. When signs are instantly recognizable and understandable, drivers and
    other roadway users experience less confusion and fewer surprises. That means
    they are less likely to misjudge a hazard or make a poor decision. The signs and
    markings used to regulate, warn, or guide traffic on roadways are collectively
    known as *traffic control devices*. Just about every aspect of their design is
    rigidly standardized within an individual country (and sometimes internationally).
    Sizes, shapes, locations, colors, symbols, and words are all carefully prescribed
    to ensure that drivers will be comfortable and capable of navigating the roadways
    no matter where they happen to go. It also makes our infrastructure more cost-effective
    because materials, products, and equipment are standardized across the country.

    devices is more than 800 pages long. It includes guidelines for just about any

    sign mounting is overhead structures, which are most common on highways because
    traffic can obstruct the view of post-mounted signs from the centermost lanes.
    Overhead sign mounts allow better visibility for all traffic lanes, and they come
    in two varieties. When carried by only a single vertical member, they are called
    cantilever sign supports. These can extend only so far because the load is unbalanced.
    For wider roadways, the supports are held on both sides by a structure called

    represent a hazard. Signs’ narrow poles can pass through many parts of a car or
    truck like butter. If an errant vehicle hits a signpost or vertical support, it
    can significantly worsen the damage and danger of the crash, so signposts are
    required to be *crashworthy*. In most cases, posts have a *breakaway* feature
    to reduce the impact on a vehicle if struck, minimizing potential for injury to
    the occupants. Wooden posts have holes drilled in them, so they easily break when
    hit. Metal signposts often use breakaway hardware called slip bases. These joints
    connect using plates with bolts in open slots. When hit, the bolts easily slip
    out, allowing the signpost to give way. A slip base has the added benefit of streamlining
    the replacement of a sign that has been knocked over. The concrete and base remain
    intact, so installing a new sign atop the original base is as simple as bolting
    it on. Overhead signs can’t be designed to break away because a falling sign could
    endanger other roadway users. Instead, the supports are protected from collisions
    using a guardrail, barrier, or crash cushion. (More information about these structures

    It used to be common to have dedicated lights to illuminate road signs at night
    or during poor weather. Now, almost all signs and roadway markings are *retroreflective*,
    meaning they reflect light back toward its source in the same direction as it
    came. Retroreflective surfaces take advantage of headlights, bouncing their light
    directly back toward the vehicle and driver inside. This makes signs and road
    markings appear much brighter than their non-retroreflective surroundings. Signs
    are surfaced with plastic sheeting embedded with glass beads or prismatic elements.
    Retroreflective glass beads are also embedded into the markings on roadway surfaces,
    making them more visible to vehicles with their headlights on. These beads are
    sometimes known as *cat’s eyes* because they function similarly to the way a cat’s
    eyes appear to glow at night when subjected to light.

    proposed road need to be raised with fill, such as when passing over a stream
    or on the approaches to a bridge. Larger areas of fill are often called embankments.
    Cuts and fills are the most fundamental elements of any earthwork project. Of
    course, you can’t visually compare before and after the earthwork is accomplished
    side by side, but it is often apparent where the natural landscape has been modified
    once you start paying attention.

- en: You might notice that cuts and fills usually tie into the natural grade on a
    slope. That’s because a soil’s strength almost entirely depends on internal friction
    between the individual soil particles. Pour out some sand on a table, and you’ll
    notice that the pile doesn’t stand straight up. Instead, it forms a slope. This
    slope’s angle is called the *angle of repose*, which is the steepest angle at
    which a soil can naturally rest. Add some weight to the top of your pile, and
    it will collapse even further.

- en: A slope’s stability can vary significantly depending on the type of soil and
    the loading it needs to withstand, but engineers rarely trust anything steeper
    than around 25 degrees. That means a constructed slope must be at least twice
    as wide as it is tall, which can be a problem for two reasons. First, it takes
    about twice as much material as a slope that can stand vertically, requiring a
    lot more excavation or fill to construct. Second, it takes up more space, which
    can be at a premium, especially in crowded cities. In many situations, it makes
    sense to avoid these disadvantages by using a retaining wall to support a steep
    (and even vertical) slope.

- en: Soil doesn’t flow as easily as water, but it is around twice as heavy. Thus,
    the force exerted on a retaining wall, called the *lateral earth pressure*, can
    be enormous. Accordingly, retaining walls must be quite strong to withstand this
    pressure. Many different types of retaining walls solve this problem in various
    ways. You’ll notice a variety of these walls in the constructed environment if
    you know where to look. They aren’t only for roadway projects, but that’s a common
    application. The most basic retaining walls rely on gravity for their stability,
    often employing a footing to create a cantilever wall. In this configuration,
    the wall can use the weight of the restrained soil to its advantage. The earth
    sits atop the footing, which acts as a lever, helping keep the wall upright against
    the lateral forces.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some retaining walls use ground anchors (also called *tiebacks*) to provide
    horizontal stability. The anchors consist of steel strands or bars grouted into
    the soil behind the wall. Once installed, a hydraulic jack applies tension to
    each anchor, and tapered wedges or nuts lock the anchors firmly against the wall.
    Bearing blocks or plates are often used to distribute the anchor load across a
    larger area, recognizable from the outside from their repeating pattern.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another kind of retaining wall uses *piles*, vertical members driven or drilled
    into the ground. They include reinforced concrete shafts installed with a drilling
    rig like gigantic fence posts. They also include interlocking steel shapes called
    sheet piling. Pile walls are often used for temporary excavations during construction
    projects because the wall can be installed first before digging begins, ensuring
    that the excavated faces have support for the entirety of construction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One common type of retaining wall involves tying a mass of soil together to
    act as its own wall. This can be accomplished during the fill operation by layering
    reinforcement elements between each lift, a technique called mechanically stabilized
    earth. The reinforcing elements can be steel strips or fabric made from plastic
    fibers called *geotextile* or *geogrid*. When the natural ground is excavated
    to create a steep face, adding layers of reinforcement isn’t feasible. Instead,
    soil nails can be inserted into the slope as reinforcement. Like ground anchors,
    soil nails consist of steel rods grouted into drilled holes. But unlike anchors,
    they are not tensioned. Instead of applying a force to the wall’s face, their
    job is to secure the soil mass together to support itself and the soil behind
    it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both mechanically stabilized earth and soil nail retaining walls use concrete
    on the outside face of the wall. These facings are rarely supporting much of the
    load. Instead, their job is to protect the exposed soil from erosion, and in permanent
    applications, improve the wall’s appearance. In temporary situations, the facing
    sometimes consists of shotcrete, a type of concrete that can be sprayed from a
    hose using compressed air. For permanent installations, they often use interlocking
    concrete panels with a decorative pattern. These panels not only look nice, but
    they also allow for some movement over time and for water to drain through the
    joints.

    finished product is just a simple ribbon of pavement sitting on the ground. It’s
    not because of idle construction workers or dishonest contractors. It’s because
    highways are complicated. Ensuring roadways can carry the amount and weight of
    modern cars and trucks and allow them to travel safely at such incredible speeds
    is no small feat. The only reason it seems ordinary to us is that roadways are
    so carefully designed and constructed. From the ground up, highways have many
    features to make fast and efficient vehicle travel possible.

    structure below the surface. Roads are built in layers, sometimes called *courses*,
    to make them durable and long-lasting. Before any new roadway can be installed,
    some earthwork is required to smooth the surface of the earth (as described in
    the previous section). The layer of existing soil upon which a road is constructed
    is called the subgrade, and it’s not always well-suited to withstand the tremendous
    and frequent loads from vehicular traffic. Instead, one or more courses of road
    base are placed and compacted on top of the subgrade, often made from crushed
    rock. Road base serves a variety of purposes. It provides a stable platform during
    construction, distributes the weight of vehicles evenly to the subgrade, provides
    drainage for any water that infiltrates below the road, and protects the pavement
    from frost.

    to the controlled chaos of constant motor vehicle traffic. Concrete is occasionally
    used as the wearing course for major highways because it is exceptionally hard
    and durable. Concrete consists of cement, rocks (known as aggregate in the industry),
    and water, and it can withstand huge volumes of heavy truck traffic better than
    any other pavement. But concrete has some disadvantages, too. It is expensive
    to install. It’s hard to repair because it takes a long time to cure, extending
    the duration of road and lane closures. And it can also be too slick when wet,
    so it must be grooved for traction with tires. That’s why, instead of concrete,
    most roadways are paved using asphalt.

    so many of the boxes needed for modern roadways. The materials are readily available.
    It provides excellent traction with tires without needing grooves. It’s flexible,
    so it can accommodate some movement of the subgrade without failure. Finally,
    it’s easy to repair. Asphalt is heated into a workable mix, placed atop the base
    course, and then compacted into place with heavy rollers. It is ready for traffic
    almost as soon as it cools down.'

    It consists of the travel lanes in which vehicles drive and shoulders, which serve
    as emergency stopping lanes for vehicles that break down. Shoulders are usually
    narrower than travel lanes and occasionally paved to a lesser thickness to save
    cost, so they can’t accommodate regular travel. Although highways might look flat,
    they usually slope toward the edges, giving the center of the road a crown. A
    flat surface doesn’t shed water quickly. Any accumulation of water is dangerous
    to vehicles by making roads slippery and creating more ice in the winter. Crowning
    the roadway accelerates the drainage of precipitation and keeps the surface of
    the road dry. Once the water has reached the edge of the pavement, it needs somewhere
    to go. Otherwise, it can soften and weaken the soils underlying the road. Highways
    often include ditches along the roadside to carry rainwater away. (See Chapter
    7 for more details on drainage structures.)

    to a hazard or loss of control. Many safety features on highways are designed
    to prevent roadway departures from turning into serious collisions. Major routes
    often separate the two traffic directions with a median, creating a divided highway.
    The median between the roadways is a grassed area used to prevent errant vehicles
    from crossing into the opposing traffic, reducing head-on collisions. Most highways
    also include a clear zone along the outside of each highway, an unobstructed area
    that gives drivers room to stop or regain control if their vehicle leaves the
    roadway. The clear zone is kept free of obstacles like trees, signs, and utility
    poles that could make a crash more serious. When signs must be placed in this
    area, they have breakaway supports to reduce the impact of a potential collision.
    And when an obstacle in the clear zone can’t be removed or made crashworthy, it
    must be protected with a barrier.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Longitudinal barriers keep vehicles from leaving the roadway when a dangerous
    obstacle or drop-off is present. They are also used in place of or in addition
    to a median between a divided highway. There are many types of barriers used for
    various situations, and they all go through full-scale crash testing before being
    used on active roadways. Steel guardrails can deflect when hit, which somewhat
    softens the blow of a collision but also means they must be replaced after each
    crash. Another common type of longitudinal barrier, called a Jersey barrier, is
    made of concrete. Its shape allows a tire to ride up the side, often redirecting
    the vehicle without causing significant damage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One challenge with longitudinal barriers is that their blunt ends can create
    a dangerous obstacle in the clear zone. Most feature end treatments to lessen
    the severity of a collision if struck. Steel guardrails often feature an impact
    head that slides along the rail when hit, deforming it to absorb the energy of
    the crash while redirecting it to the side to protect the vehicle’s occupants.
    Rigid barriers often include a crash cushion at their ends. There are a wide variety
    of designs, but the most common feature barrels filled with sand or crushable
    steel components that can absorb the energy of a collision, significantly reducing
    the severity.

- en: One class of roadway looks much different from urban arterial and collector
    roads. I use the term *highway* in this book, but others may call them freeways,
    motorways, expressways, or throughways. Whatever way you call them, they achieve
    the pinnacle of traffic capacity through *controlled access*. For smaller highways,
    that means a reduced number of driveways and at-grade intersections. For the highest
    capacity roads, it means the only way to enter or exit them is by a ramp or interchange
    (more on those in a later section). Controlling access to the road reduces interruptions,
    allowing a relatively unhindered flow of high-speed traffic. That increased speed
    usually means increased roadway capacity. However, it also decreases the time
    for decision-making by drivers and, thus, increases the potential for dangerous
    crashes. It is remarkable that we’re able to put ourselves in metal boxes that
    hurtle away at incredible speeds from place to place, and highways include a multitude
    of safety features that make such travel possible. This safety starts at the most
    basic level possible in how the roadway unfolds as you drive along (often simply
    called its *layout*).
  prefs: []

    along at whatever speed we wanted. But all highways include hazards like curves,
    hills, traffic, obstacles, and weather. Reality dictates that we balance vehicles’
    speed with drivers’ abilities to navigate such dangers. Three essential speeds
    on highways are not always equal: the *design speed*, the posted *speed limit*,
    and the speed at which any individual driver chooses to travel. Drivers select
    their speed based on their personal skill level, comfort, and perception of hazards.
    Roadway operators set the speed limit based on widely accepted standards for safety.
    Highway designers choose a design speed to ensure that all the geometric features
    along the roadway are consistent and appropriate for the eventual velocity at
    which most drivers will travel.'

- en: A highway’s *alignment* is its horizontal layout—the way it appears when looking
    from above. All roads include curves needed to change the direction of travel,
    and those curves can present severe challenges to drivers if not designed correctly.
    Any object changing its direction needs a centripetal force toward the center
    of the turn. Otherwise, it will just continue in a straight line. When you feel
    pushed to one side of the vehicle during a turn, this is your body’s inertia trying
    to keep you moving straight while your car turns. For a vehicle, the centripetal
    force comes from the friction between the tires and the road. This force increases
    as the radius of the turn decreases. At a certain speed and turning radius, the
    required centripetal force can exceed the tire friction, leading a vehicle to
    skid off the roadway. To avoid this dangerous condition, engineers select the
    minimum turning radius of curves depending on the roadway’s design speed—the faster
    the rate, the gentler the curve.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rubber tires provide traction against a road surface, but we can also use geometry
    to make curves safer for drivers. Highway designers often make the outside edge
    higher or superelevated above the centerline to reduce the need for tire friction
    around curves. Banking a roadway around a turn takes advantage of the *normal*  (that
    is, perpendicular) *force* from the pavement to provide some or all of the needed
    centripetal force. In general, the faster the design speed of the road, the steeper
    the bank around the bend. Superelevation also makes travel around curves more
    comfortable because the centrifugal tendency pushes passengers into their seats
    rather than out of them. If the superelevation angle is just right and you’re
    traveling at precisely the roadway’s design speed, the level in your cup of coffee
    won’t change at all around the bend.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One other important aspect when designing a horizontal curve comes from the
    simple but crucial fact that drivers need to see what’s coming up to react accordingly.
    Sight distance is the length of the roadway visible to the driver at any given
    point in time. On a straight and level section of highway, it is limited only
    by the driver’s visual acuity. However, any time a roadway changes direction,
    a driver’s field of view can be blocked by obstructions. If the sight distance
    isn’t enough to recognize and respond to a hazard, a crash may result. The faster
    you’re traveling, the more distance you need to observe turns or obstacles and
    decide how to manage them. Even if a curve is gentle enough for a car to traverse
    without skidding, it may not have enough sight distance for safety due to an obstacle
    like a hill or wooded area obscuring the driver’s view. In such a case, the highway
    designer would need to increase the curve’s radius to lengthen the driver’s sight
    distance to a safer extent (or just remove the obstacle).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The final aspect of roadway geometry is the vertical configuration, also known
    as the *profile*. Roads rarely traverse perfectly flat areas. Instead, they go
    up and over hills and down into valleys. The slope, or *grade*, of a roadway is
    an important design decision. Roads that are too steep make travel difficult,
    especially for heavy trucks. Uphill stretches are slow-going, and long downhill
    sections can overheat vehicles’ brakes. Grade changes also must happen smoothly
    to avoid bumps and jerks for the comfort of drivers. On top of all that, vertical
    curves have the potential to reduce drivers’ sight distance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Crest curves—the ones that are convex upward—cause the roadway to hide itself
    beyond the top. If you’re traveling quickly up a hill, a stalled vehicle or animal
    on the other side could take you by surprise. A crest curve that is too tight
    won’t give you enough sight distance to recognize and react to the obstacle. So,
    designers must make sure that these curves are sufficiently gentle so that you
    can still see enough of the roadway as you go up and over. Sag curves—the ones
    that are concave upward—don’t have this same issue. During the day, you can see
    all the roadway on both sides of the curve. However, at night things change. Vehicles
    rely on headlights to illuminate the road ahead, and sometimes this can be the
    limiting factor for sight distance. If a sag curve is too tight, headlights won’t
    throw as far. The result is that the sight distance is reduced, making it difficult
    to react to obstacles at night.

    a challenge. Multiple streams of traffic need a way to occupy the overlapping
    space safely. When the intersection is at grade (in other words, on the ground),
    traffic flow must be interrupted. Through signs, signals, or roundabouts, the
    *right of way* is assigned to each traffic stream individually while the others
    wait. Those frequent starts and stops aren’t desirable on a highway that uses
    controlled access to reduce interruptions, allowing a relatively unhindered flow
    of high-speed traffic. Instead, entrances, exits, and intersections of highways
    are often accomplished through grade-separated junctions, also known as interchanges.
    Grade separation allows streams of traffic to cross each other safely and efficiently
    without interruption.

    used where a controlled-access highway crosses a minor road. Off-ramps diverge
    from the highway, meeting the minor road at a right angle. The off-ramps become
    on-ramps past the minor road, returning to the highway. The two conventional intersections
    formed at the ramps are controlled via signs or traffic signals. One of the roadways
    will include a bridge, also called an overpass, to achieve the grade separation.

    the *substructure*. Abutments provide support to the beams at each end of the
    bridge, accommodating the horizontal and vertical loads of the superstructure.
    The intermediate supports between each of the bridge’s spans are called piers
    when consisting of a single column and *bents* when a frame of multiple columns
    is used. They are usually designed to handle only vertical loads to be simpler
    and smaller than the two abutments. In some cases, the piers include caps to distribute

    Vibrations from vehicles, settlement of the foundation, expansion and contraction
    due to temperature, and even forces from the wind can introduce small movements
    in the superstructure. Rather than make the bridge stiff enough to withstand even
    the tiniest motion, most bridges use bearings to accommodate this movement, often
    made from layers of rubber and steel. These pads can transfer the loads of the
    bridge while still allowing some movement of the superstructure.

    and it usually consists of an earthen embankment. Soil is compacted in layers
    to create a smooth path up to the bridge. Earth isn’t stable with a vertical face,
    so embankments often have slopes on each side. The slopes are generally covered
    in grass to protect against soil erosion. However, grass doesn’t grow well in
    the shady areas below a bridge. Concrete slabs, called slope paving, are often
    installed on the sloped soil faces below a bridge as armoring against erosion.

    any direction without interruption. There are many ways to accomplish such connectivity,
    each with its own advantages and disadvantages. One of the most basic types is
    the cloverleaf interchange, named for its distinctive shape on a map. In a cloverleaf
    interchange, the vehicles turning right follow a gentle curve to transition to
    the crossing roadway. The left turners go past the intersection, then follow a
    sharp right-hand loop onto the other route in the opposite direction. Cloverleaf
    interchanges require only a single bridge, so they are relatively inexpensive
    to construct. However, they have some disadvantages too. Most significantly, the
    left-turn entrance ramps come before the exit ramps, forcing traffic entering
    and leaving the highway to weave across each other. This weaving can significantly
    limit the interchange’s capacity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of junction, the right turns usually remain at grade, just like a cloverleaf.
    However, the left turns are handled by elevated ramps, often called flyovers.
    The two pairs of left-turning ramps must be stacked above or below the highways,
    giving this interchange its name. Stack interchanges generally have the highest
    capacity of all different types of four-way junctions. However, they are complex
    and expensive structures due to the many layers of elevated roadways required.

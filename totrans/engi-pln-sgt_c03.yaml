  zh: 引言
- en: Of all the elements of our constructed environment, roads may be the least noticed,
    yet they are almost as fundamental as the air we breathe. You almost certainly
    arrived where you are now via a road, and one will likely take you wherever you
    go next. The first roadways in history were formed as people or animals followed
    the same trail long enough to erode a path between two points. They have always
    existed in some form, but they haven’t always been safe, comfortable, or able
    to accommodate the enormous number and weight of vehicles that use our present
    system of roadways every day. Over the years, the demands on streets and highways
    have only increased as more people and goods are on the move. Their designs have
    evolved alongside this demand. It may not always seem so, but roads now carry
    more and heavier vehicles than they ever have in history. With their omnipresence,
    their value to society is easy to forget. But the engineers, contractors, and
    public works crews who study, design, construct, and maintain our roadways know
    how important they are in moving goods and transporting people. Whether or not
    you love how much roads dominate the landscape, you have to marvel at the fact
    that, in most parts of the modern world, anyone can take a bus, car, bike, truck,
    motorcycle, or scooter to go almost anywhere else with relative ease and comfort.

- en: Nothing has had a more significant impact on the planning and design of cities
    in the past 100 years than the automobile. With their explosion in popularity
    in the early 20th century, motor vehicles became the standard mode of urban transportation.
    And with that, cities needed roads to accommodate the growing volume of traffic.
    There are a lot of good analogies between cities and human anatomy, and roadways
    are no exception. In fact, roads are often referred to by their cardiovascular
    equivalents. Highways are like the aorta with a high capacity and single major
    destination. Small collector roads are like capillaries with not much capacity
    but a connection to every individual house and business. In between are the aptly
    named arterial roadways, the medium-capacity connections between urban centers.
    All together, they form an urban transportation network allowing vehicles to travel
    (somewhat) efficiently between any two places on the map.

  zh: 在过去100年里，没有什么比汽车对城市规划和设计的影响更大。随着20世纪初汽车的普及，机动车成为了城市交通的主要方式。随之而来的是，城市需要建设道路来应对日益增长的交通量。城市与人体解剖学之间有很多相似之处，道路也不例外。事实上，道路常常被比作心血管系统的各个部分。高速公路就像主动脉，具有较高的通行能力和单一的主要目的地。小型集散道路就像毛细血管，容量小，但与每一座房屋和商铺都有联系。介于两者之间的是被恰当地称为主干道的道路，它们是城市中心之间的中等容量连接。所有这些道路共同构成了一个城市交通网络，使车辆可以（相对）高效地在地图上的任何两个地方之间移动。
- en: Although it might not always seem to be the case, streets in cities create routes
    for more than just automobiles. Collectors and arterial roadways truly make up
    the city’s circulatory system, providing a path for cars, trucks, buses, bicycles,
    pedestrians, utility lines, and even stormwater runoff. Although every street
    is different, most urban roadways share many of the same features. This section
    provides an overview of the most common elements you might see in your city.

  zh: 尽管看起来可能并非总是如此，城市中的街道不仅仅为汽车提供路线。集散道路和主干道真正构成了城市的循环系统，为汽车、卡车、公交车、自行车、行人、公共设施线路甚至雨水排放提供了通道。虽然每条街道都不同，但大多数城市道路都有许多共同的特点。本节将概述你在城市中可能看到的最常见的元素。
- en: One way to characterize roadways is how they cross, also known as *intersections*.
    Collectors and arterial roads commonly overlap *at grade*, in other words, on
    the ground at the same level. That means only a few traffic streams can pass through
    simultaneously, resulting in an interrupted flow of traffic. These intersections
    are also where a vast majority of crashes occur. For those reasons, traffic engineers
    put much thought and analysis into the design of intersections and how to make
    them as safe and efficient as possible. This challenge almost always requires
    a compromise of numerous conflicting considerations, including space, cost, types
    and volumes of traffic, and human factors like habits, expectations, and reaction
    times. The simplest intersections are sign-controlled, using stop or yield signs
    to manage the flow of traffic. They are cost-effective and don’t require any extra
    space, but they can’t handle high volumes because they create an interruption
    for every vehicle passing through. Signal-controlled intersections use electric
    lights to indicate which traffic can proceed. (Traffic signals are covered in
    detail later in the book.) Roundabouts are circular intersections that keep traffic
    flowing around a central island. Although they sometimes take up more space than
    other types of junctions, they have some distinct advantages. Roundabouts handle
    traffic efficiently by avoiding the start and stop of interrupted flow, and they
    create fewer dangerous collisions because of the slower speeds and single direction
    of traffic. Of course, within these three basic categories exist an endless array
    of intersection configurations. If you drive long enough, you will see the wide
    variety of intersection types and layouts used by engineers to keep roadway traffic
    flowing safely and efficiently.

  zh: 描述道路的一种方式是它们的交叉点，也称为*交叉口*。收集道路和主干道通常在*同一级别*重叠，换句话说，就在地面上。这意味着只有少数交通流可以同时通过，导致交通流动中断。这些交叉口也是绝大多数事故发生的地方。因此，交通工程师对交叉口的设计以及如何使其尽可能安全和高效进行了深思熟虑和分析。这一挑战几乎总是需要在包括空间、成本、交通类型和量以及人类因素（如习惯、期望和反应时间）等众多相互冲突的考虑因素之间进行妥协。最简单的交叉口是由标志控制的，使用停止或让行标志来管理交通流。它们具有成本效益，并且不需要额外的空间，但是无法处理高流量，因为它们会为通过的每辆车辆造成中断。信号控制的交叉口使用电灯指示哪些交通可以通行。（交通信号灯将在本书的后续部分详细介绍。）环形交叉口是围绕中心岛屿使交通流畅的圆形交叉口。虽然它们有时占用比其他类型的交叉点更多的空间，但它们具有一些明显的优势。环形交叉口通过避免中断流的起停来高效处理交通，并且由于较慢的速度和单向交通，它们造成的危险碰撞较少。当然，在这三种基本类别内存在着无数种交叉口配置。如果你开车时间足够长，你会看到工程师们用来确保道路交通安全高效流动的各种交叉口类型和布局。
- en: Roadways consist of travel lanes for vehicles and occasionally space for bicycle
    and parking lanes as well. The roadway’s surface is usually crowned in the center
    with a slope toward the outer edges to shed rainwater off the driving surface.
    At the outer edges, curbs separate the pavement from the developed area, and gutters
    provide a channel for rainwater to travel. Many cities and towns include a narrow
    strip between the road and sidewalk to provide a safety buffer between fast-moving
    vehicles and vulnerable pedestrians. This area has many regional names, including
    curb strip, *verge*, and *berm*. It also provides a location for utility poles,
    signs, and streetlamps.

- en: Unfortunately, pavement is not invincible. One of the most common frustrations
    of city driving is the pothole. They’re annoying, yes, but they’re more than that.
    Potholes cause billions of dollars of damage to tires, shocks, and wheels of vehicles.
    Even worse, they’re dangerous. Cars swerve to miss them, sometimes at high speeds,
    and if a bike, motorcycle, or scooter hits one, it can be bad news for the rider.
    The formation of a pothole happens in steps, the first of which is deterioration
    of the surface pavement. They might seem innocuous, but cracks are critical flaws
    in a pavement system because they let in water. Soil below the pavement can become
    waterlogged from precipitation, softening and weakening the subgrade. Water below
    the roadway can also freeze and grow into a formation called an ice lens. Water
    expands when it freezes, and it does so with tremendous force, separating the
    subgrade and pavement. When those lenses thaw out, the ice that was supporting
    the pavement recedes, creating voids. Every time a tire hits this soft area, it
    pushes some of the water and underlying soil back out of the pavement. It’s a
    slow process at first, but every little bit of subgrade eroded from beneath the
    pavement means less support, and less support means more volume below the pavement
    for water to be pumped in and out by traffic. Eventually, the pavement loses enough
    support that it fails, breaking off and creating a pothole.

  zh: 不幸的是，路面并不是坚不可摧的。城市驾驶中最常见的烦恼之一就是坑洞。它们确实让人烦恼，但不仅仅是这样。坑洞每年给车辆的轮胎、减震器和车轮带来数十亿美元的损失。更糟糕的是，它们非常危险。汽车为了避开坑洞可能会急转弯，有时以高速行驶，而如果自行车、摩托车或滑板车碰到坑洞，骑行者可能会遭遇严重的伤害。坑洞的形成是一个逐步过程，其中第一步是路面表面的恶化。它们可能看起来无害，但裂缝是路面系统中的关键缺陷，因为它们允许水渗入。路面下的土壤可能会因降水而饱和，软化并削弱基层。路面下的水也可能会结冰，形成一种叫做冰透镜的结构。水在结冰时会膨胀，并且膨胀时产生巨大的力量，分开基层和路面。当这些冰透镜融化时，支撑路面的冰会消退，形成空隙。每次轮胎经过这个软化区域时，它都会把一些水和下面的土壤挤出路面。刚开始时这是一个缓慢的过程，但每一点从路面下被侵蚀的基层意味着支撑变少，而支撑减少意味着路面下水分的体积增加，这些水会随着交通来回流动。最终，路面失去足够的支撑而失败，破裂并形成坑洞。
- en: 'Because potholes are so destructive and inconvenient, roadway owners spend
    a lot of time and money both trying to prevent them from forming and fixing them
    when they appear. Prevention mainly involves sealing cracks against water intrusion.
    Repairs can be wide-ranging depending on the materials, cost, and climate conditions.
    But they all mostly do the same thing: replace the soil and pavement that was
    lost and (hopefully) seal the area off from further water intrusion. If the pothole
    repair does not create a good connection with the rest of the roadway, a pothole
    can recur in the same location.'

- en: One of the most apparent pedestrian accommodations is the sidewalk, a narrow
    path generally separated from the street. These footpaths can be made from many
    materials, but they are ribbons of concrete in most cities. Sidewalks may appear
    simple, but considerable engineering is present in their design and construction.
    The cracking of concrete is inevitable. Tree roots invade the subsurface, cycles
    of freeze and thaw lift the soil, and vehicles impose unanticipated loads. Sidewalks
    are designed with control joints to constrain the cracks’ location to a regular
    pattern by artificially weakening the concrete. These induced cracks are preferential
    to the unsightly random arrangement that would otherwise occur. Also, concrete
    shrinks and expands according to temperature. On small structures, this may be
    imperceptible, but for long shapes (like sidewalks), the thermal movement can
    add up. Occasional spaces, called expansion joints, are left in the concrete to
    prevent sidewalks from buckling or having significant gaps. The joints are typically
    filled with wood, cork, or rubber to allow for movement over time.

- en: '*Accessibility* is the term used to describe how we make sidewalks and other
    pedestrian facilities safe and efficient for all users, including those with disabilities.
    Sidewalks have specific minimum widths and slopes to make sure they’re not too
    challenging to traverse. Where a sidewalk meets a curb, it often includes a ramp
    down to the street’s surface. This ramp is called a curb cut, and it ensures that
    users of wheelchairs, walkers, and canes can easily transition onto the path.
    It also helps pedestrians pushing carts or strollers and even children on bicycles.
    In addition, sidewalks often feature tactile pavement. These bumpy areas help
    people with visual disabilities delineate the boundary between sidewalk and road.
    They are detectable warnings for those who might not otherwise be able to identify
    a potential hazard, including subway lines, steep grades, stairs, and road crossings.

- en: Another critical aspect of pedestrian infrastructure is to allow those on foot
    to cross streets safely. Crosswalks are designated areas for pedestrians to cross
    a road, making them more visible and predictable to motorists. They are usually
    located at intersections and marked with large white bars. When a junction has
    a traffic signal, lights at either end of each crosswalk show pedestrians when
    to cross. Some pedestrian signals even include a countdown timer to show how many
    seconds are remaining to cross. Depending on the traffic volume, the crossing
    signal may be simultaneous with the green light for vehicle traffic, or there
    may be a phase when only pedestrians are allowed to move. Some lights stagger
    the phases, so pedestrians get a head start from drivers. Some signals operate
    exclusively on a preprogrammed timer, while others are actuated with a call button
    at the sidewalk. Even if the switch is present, that doesn’t necessarily mean
    it’s connected to the signal controller. Sometimes these buttons are simply *placebos*,

- en: Bicycling is one of the most efficient, healthy, and fun ways to get around,

    Most places have laws allowing bikes to use the same travel lanes as motor vehicles,
    but few cyclists feel comfortable doing so except on the least busy streets. There
    are many different approaches to accommodating bicycle traffic in cities. One
    of the most straightforward measures is the sharrow, a symbol used to mark the
    preferred path for cyclists on shared travel lanes. *Uniformity* is a crucial
    concept in traffic engineering. If all road users know what to expect, they are
    less likely to make errors in judgment that lead to collisions. Sharrows don’t

    Ideally, a green light should last at least long enough to clear the queue built
    up during the red light, but it isn’t always possible, especially during peak
    times on busy intersections. In cases where the junction is saturated, the green
    light might be extended to reduce the number of cycles since each one includes
    startup and clearance times—the periods when the intersection isn’t being utilized
    to its maximum capacity.

    and decelerate their vehicles to a stop at a comfortable rate. Design guidelines
    consider many factors, but the duration of the amber light is usually set to around
    one second for every 10 miles per hour or 16 kilometers per hour on the speed
    limit. In most places in North America, you are allowed to enter an intersection
    for the entire duration of a yellow light, which means there needs to be a time
    when all phases have a red light to allow the junction to clear. This clearance
    interval is usually about one second, but it can be adjusted up or down based
    on the speed limit and intersection size.

    but many are more sophisticated than that. *Actuated signal control* is the term
    we use for traffic lights that can receive input from the outside to adjust timing
    and phase sequence on the fly. Actuated signals rely on data from traffic-detection
    systems that can be video cameras, radar detectors, or inductive loop sensors
    embedded into the road surface. These latter sensors are essentially large metal
    detectors that can measure whether a car or truck is present (to the annoyance
    of bicycles, scooters, and motorcycles that are sometimes too small to trigger
    the loop). Whatever the type of sensor, they all feed data into an equipment cabinet

- en: Inside this cabinet is a traffic signal controller, a simple computer programmed
    with logic to determine when and how long each phase will last based on the information
    from the detectors. Actuated control gives a traffic signal much more flexibility
    to handle variations in traffic load. For example, if a nearby road is closed
    and traffic is rerouted through an intersection that doesn’t usually see such
    high demand, it may need to be reprogrammed before the closure. A traffic signal
    equipped with actuated control will simply see the additional traffic and adjust
    its phasing accordingly. The same is true with special events, like concerts and
    sports games, that create colossal traffic demands on irregular schedules. Actuated
    systems can also keep you from waiting at a long light when no one’s crossing
    in the other direction. Finally, actuated control can help prioritize emergency
    and public transportation vehicles equipped with specialized transmitters. Infrared
    or acoustic preemption devices communicate with transmitters on each prioritized
    vehicle to send the signal controller a call for green.

- en: Actuated control isn’t the pinnacle of signal complexity. After all, it still
    treats each intersection as an isolated entity when it is actually one component
    of a larger traffic network. Each element of the traffic network can have an impact
    on other parts of the system. The classic example of this is *gridlock*, where
    queues of vehicles block adjacent intersections in a way that brings the flow
    of traffic to a standstill. One solution to this problem is *signal coordination*,
    where lights can work in synchronization with each other. Coordinated signals
    are employed on long corridors with small but frequent cross streets. The signals
    on the major road are timed so that a large group of vehicles, called a *platoon*
    by traffic engineers, can make it some or all of the way through the corridor
    without interruption. This coordination can significantly increase the volume
    of traffic able to pass through intersections, but it works only on stretches
    of road that don’t have other sources of traffic interruptions like driveways
    and businesses. If the platoon can’t stick together, the benefits of coordinating
    signals are reduced.

    uniformity of signs and markings. Motorists moving at rapid speeds must make snap
    decisions. When signs are instantly recognizable and understandable, drivers and
    other roadway users experience less confusion and fewer surprises. That means
    they are less likely to misjudge a hazard or make a poor decision. The signs and
    markings used to regulate, warn, or guide traffic on roadways are collectively
    known as *traffic control devices*. Just about every aspect of their design is
    rigidly standardized within an individual country (and sometimes internationally).
    Sizes, shapes, locations, colors, symbols, and words are all carefully prescribed
    to ensure that drivers will be comfortable and capable of navigating the roadways
    no matter where they happen to go. It also makes our infrastructure more cost-effective
    because materials, products, and equipment are standardized across the country.
    In the United States, the manual that governs the uniformity of traffic control
    devices is more than 800 pages long. It includes guidelines for just about any

- en: Most signs are mounted on metal posts adjacent to the roadway. These posts hold
    the sign high enough to be easily seen by all road users. The other option for
    sign mounting is overhead structures, which are most common on highways because
    traffic can obstruct the view of post-mounted signs from the centermost lanes.
    Overhead sign mounts allow better visibility for all traffic lanes, and they come
    in two varieties. When carried by only a single vertical member, they are called
    cantilever sign supports. These can extend only so far because the load is unbalanced.
    For wider roadways, the supports are held on both sides by a structure called

- en: Although signs are critical to keeping roadways safe and efficient, they can
    represent a hazard. Signs’ narrow poles can pass through many parts of a car or
    truck like butter. If an errant vehicle hits a signpost or vertical support, it
    can significantly worsen the damage and danger of the crash, so signposts are
    required to be *crashworthy*. In most cases, posts have a *breakaway* feature
    to reduce the impact on a vehicle if struck, minimizing potential for injury to
    the occupants. Wooden posts have holes drilled in them, so they easily break when
    hit. Metal signposts often use breakaway hardware called slip bases. These joints
    connect using plates with bolts in open slots. When hit, the bolts easily slip
    out, allowing the signpost to give way. A slip base has the added benefit of streamlining
    the replacement of a sign that has been knocked over. The concrete and base remain
    intact, so installing a new sign atop the original base is as simple as bolting
    it on. Overhead signs can’t be designed to break away because a falling sign could
    endanger other roadway users. Instead, the supports are protected from collisions
    using a guardrail, barrier, or crash cushion. (More information about these structures

    surface itself. Lines and stripes are painted onto the pavement to provide information

- en: Traffic control devices aren’t much use if they aren’t visible in the dark.
    It used to be common to have dedicated lights to illuminate road signs at night
    or during poor weather. Now, almost all signs and roadway markings are *retroreflective*,
    meaning they reflect light back toward its source in the same direction as it
    came. Retroreflective surfaces take advantage of headlights, bouncing their light
    directly back toward the vehicle and driver inside. This makes signs and road
    markings appear much brighter than their non-retroreflective surroundings. Signs
    are surfaced with plastic sheeting embedded with glass beads or prismatic elements.
    Retroreflective glass beads are also embedded into the markings on roadway surfaces,
    making them more visible to vehicles with their headlights on. These beads are
    sometimes known as *cat’s eyes* because they function similarly to the way a cat’s
    eyes appear to glow at night when subjected to light.

    fibers called *geotextile* or *geogrid*. When the natural ground is excavated
    to create a steep face, adding layers of reinforcement isn’t feasible. Instead,
    soil nails can be inserted into the slope as reinforcement. Like ground anchors,
    soil nails consist of steel rods grouted into drilled holes. But unlike anchors,
    they are not tensioned. Instead of applying a force to the wall’s face, their
    job is to secure the soil mass together to support itself and the soil behind
    it.

    structure below the surface. Roads are built in layers, sometimes called *courses*,
    to make them durable and long-lasting. Before any new roadway can be installed,
    some earthwork is required to smooth the surface of the earth (as described in
    the previous section). The layer of existing soil upon which a road is constructed
    is called the subgrade, and it’s not always well-suited to withstand the tremendous
    and frequent loads from vehicular traffic. Instead, one or more courses of road
    base are placed and compacted on top of the subgrade, often made from crushed
    rock. Road base serves a variety of purposes. It provides a stable platform during
    construction, distributes the weight of vehicles evenly to the subgrade, provides
    drainage for any water that infiltrates below the road, and protects the pavement
    from frost.

    used as the wearing course for major highways because it is exceptionally hard
    and durable. Concrete consists of cement, rocks (known as aggregate in the industry),
    and water, and it can withstand huge volumes of heavy truck traffic better than
    any other pavement. But concrete has some disadvantages, too. It is expensive
    to install. It’s hard to repair because it takes a long time to cure, extending
    the duration of road and lane closures. And it can also be too slick when wet,
    so it must be grooved for traction with tires. That’s why, instead of concrete,
    most roadways are paved using asphalt.

    so it can accommodate some movement of the subgrade without failure. Finally,

- en: The term highway is usually used to describe the entire width of the paved road.
    It consists of the travel lanes in which vehicles drive and shoulders, which serve
    as emergency stopping lanes for vehicles that break down. Shoulders are usually
    narrower than travel lanes and occasionally paved to a lesser thickness to save
    cost, so they can’t accommodate regular travel. Although highways might look flat,
    they usually slope toward the edges, giving the center of the road a crown. A
    flat surface doesn’t shed water quickly. Any accumulation of water is dangerous
    to vehicles by making roads slippery and creating more ice in the winter. Crowning
    the roadway accelerates the drainage of precipitation and keeps the surface of
    the road dry. Once the water has reached the edge of the pavement, it needs somewhere
    to go. Otherwise, it can soften and weaken the soils underlying the road. Highways
    often include ditches along the roadside to carry rainwater away. (See Chapter

    The median between the roadways is a grassed area used to prevent errant vehicles
    from crossing into the opposing traffic, reducing head-on collisions. Most highways
    also include a clear zone along the outside of each highway, an unobstructed area
    that gives drivers room to stop or regain control if their vehicle leaves the
    roadway. The clear zone is kept free of obstacles like trees, signs, and utility
    poles that could make a crash more serious. When signs must be placed in this
    area, they have breakaway supports to reduce the impact of a potential collision.

- en: Longitudinal barriers keep vehicles from leaving the roadway when a dangerous
    obstacle or drop-off is present. They are also used in place of or in addition
    to a median between a divided highway. There are many types of barriers used for
    various situations, and they all go through full-scale crash testing before being
    used on active roadways. Steel guardrails can deflect when hit, which somewhat
    softens the blow of a collision but also means they must be replaced after each
    crash. Another common type of longitudinal barrier, called a Jersey barrier, is

    roads. I use the term *highway* in this book, but others may call them freeways,
    motorways, expressways, or throughways. Whatever way you call them, they achieve
    the pinnacle of traffic capacity through *controlled access*. For smaller highways,
    that means a reduced number of driveways and at-grade intersections. For the highest
    capacity roads, it means the only way to enter or exit them is by a ramp or interchange
    (more on those in a later section). Controlling access to the road reduces interruptions,
    allowing a relatively unhindered flow of high-speed traffic. That increased speed
    usually means increased roadway capacity. However, it also decreases the time
    for decision-making by drivers and, thus, increases the potential for dangerous
    crashes. It is remarkable that we’re able to put ourselves in metal boxes that
    hurtle away at incredible speeds from place to place, and highways include a multitude

- en: A highway’s *alignment* is its horizontal layout—the way it appears when looking
    from above. All roads include curves needed to change the direction of travel,
    and those curves can present severe challenges to drivers if not designed correctly.
    Any object changing its direction needs a centripetal force toward the center
    of the turn. Otherwise, it will just continue in a straight line. When you feel
    pushed to one side of the vehicle during a turn, this is your body’s inertia trying
    to keep you moving straight while your car turns. For a vehicle, the centripetal
    force comes from the friction between the tires and the road. This force increases
    as the radius of the turn decreases. At a certain speed and turning radius, the
    required centripetal force can exceed the tire friction, leading a vehicle to
    skid off the roadway. To avoid this dangerous condition, engineers select the
    minimum turning radius of curves depending on the roadway’s design speed—the faster
    the rate, the gentler the curve.

- en: Rubber tires provide traction against a road surface, but we can also use geometry
    to make curves safer for drivers. Highway designers often make the outside edge
    higher or superelevated above the centerline to reduce the need for tire friction
    around curves. Banking a roadway around a turn takes advantage of the *normal*  (that
    is, perpendicular) *force* from the pavement to provide some or all of the needed
    centripetal force. In general, the faster the design speed of the road, the steeper
    the bank around the bend. Superelevation also makes travel around curves more
    comfortable because the centrifugal tendency pushes passengers into their seats
    rather than out of them. If the superelevation angle is just right and you’re

- en: One other important aspect when designing a horizontal curve comes from the
    simple but crucial fact that drivers need to see what’s coming up to react accordingly.
    Sight distance is the length of the roadway visible to the driver at any given
    point in time. On a straight and level section of highway, it is limited only
    by the driver’s visual acuity. However, any time a roadway changes direction,
    a driver’s field of view can be blocked by obstructions. If the sight distance
    isn’t enough to recognize and respond to a hazard, a crash may result. The faster
    you’re traveling, the more distance you need to observe turns or obstacles and
    decide how to manage them. Even if a curve is gentle enough for a car to traverse
    without skidding, it may not have enough sight distance for safety due to an obstacle
    like a hill or wooded area obscuring the driver’s view. In such a case, the highway
    designer would need to increase the curve’s radius to lengthen the driver’s sight
    distance to a safer extent (or just remove the obstacle).

  zh: 设计水平曲线时，另一个重要的方面源于一个简单但至关重要的事实，那就是驾驶员需要看到前方的情况，以便做出相应的反应。视距是指在任何给定时刻，驾驶员能够看到的道路长度。在笔直且平坦的高速公路上，视距仅受驾驶员视觉敏锐度的限制。然而，每当道路改变方向时，驾驶员的视野可能会被障碍物阻挡。如果视距不足以识别和应对危险，就可能发生碰撞。行驶速度越快，观察转弯或障碍物的距离就越长，驾驶员需要更多的时间来判断如何应对。即使一个曲线足够平缓，车辆可以在没有打滑的情况下通过，但由于障碍物（如山丘或树林遮挡了驾驶员的视线），它可能没有足够的视距来确保安全。在这种情况下，高速公路设计师需要增加曲线的半径，以延长驾驶员的视距，达到更安全的程度（或者干脆移除障碍物）。
- en: The final aspect of roadway geometry is the vertical configuration, also known
    as the *profile*. Roads rarely traverse perfectly flat areas. Instead, they go
    up and over hills and down into valleys. The slope, or *grade*, of a roadway is
    an important design decision. Roads that are too steep make travel difficult,
    especially for heavy trucks. Uphill stretches are slow-going, and long downhill
    sections can overheat vehicles’ brakes. Grade changes also must happen smoothly
    to avoid bumps and jerks for the comfort of drivers. On top of all that, vertical

- en: Crest curves—the ones that are convex upward—cause the roadway to hide itself
    beyond the top. If you’re traveling quickly up a hill, a stalled vehicle or animal
    on the other side could take you by surprise. A crest curve that is too tight
    won’t give you enough sight distance to recognize and react to the obstacle. So,
    designers must make sure that these curves are sufficiently gentle so that you
    can still see enough of the roadway as you go up and over. Sag curves—the ones
    that are concave upward—don’t have this same issue. During the day, you can see
    all the roadway on both sides of the curve. However, at night things change. Vehicles
    rely on headlights to illuminate the road ahead, and sometimes this can be the
    limiting factor for sight distance. If a sag curve is too tight, headlights won’t
    throw as far. The result is that the sight distance is reduced, making it difficult
    to react to obstacles at night.

    the forces across each beam and column evenly.

  zh: 桥梁的*上部结构*包括支撑车辆行驶的桥面板的梁和结构部件。桥梁的重量以及所有车辆的重压必须传递到桥梁的基础。这由*下部结构*来完成。桥头提供支撑给桥梁两端的梁，承受上部结构的水平和垂直荷载。桥梁跨越之间的中间支撑称为墩柱，如果由单一柱体组成则叫做墩，若使用多个柱子组成框架则叫做*弯头*。它们通常设计成仅承受垂直荷载，因此比两个桥头更简单、更小。在某些情况下，墩柱上会有顶板，用来均匀地分配作用在每根梁和柱上的力。
- en: Bridges may seem like static structures, but they must be somewhat flexible.
    Vibrations from vehicles, settlement of the foundation, expansion and contraction
    due to temperature, and even forces from the wind can introduce small movements
    in the superstructure. Rather than make the bridge stiff enough to withstand even
    the tiniest motion, most bridges use bearings to accommodate this movement, often
    made from layers of rubber and steel. These pads can transfer the loads of the
    bridge while still allowing some movement of the superstructure.

  zh: 桥梁看起来可能是静态结构，但它们必须具有一定的灵活性。车辆的振动、基础的沉降、由于温度变化引起的膨胀和收缩，甚至风力的作用都可能在上部结构中引入微小的运动。与其让桥梁足够坚固以承受任何微小的运动，大多数桥梁使用轴承来适应这种运动，这些轴承通常由橡胶和钢铁的层叠组成。这些垫片可以在仍允许上部结构一定运动的情况下，转移桥梁的负荷。
- en: The transition between an at-grade roadway and a bridge is called the approach,
    and it usually consists of an earthen embankment. Soil is compacted in layers
    to create a smooth path up to the bridge. Earth isn’t stable with a vertical face,
    so embankments often have slopes on each side. The slopes are generally covered
    in grass to protect against soil erosion. However, grass doesn’t grow well in
    the shady areas below a bridge. Concrete slabs, called slope paving, are often
    installed on the sloped soil faces below a bridge as armoring against erosion.
    (Chapter 4 includes further details about bridges.)

  zh: 等高道路和桥梁之间的过渡称为接近段，通常由土路堤组成。土壤按层压实，形成一条平滑的路面直达桥梁。由于土壤不稳定，无法形成垂直的面，所以路堤常常在每一侧都有斜坡。斜坡一般覆盖草皮，以防止土壤侵蚀。然而，草在桥下阴影处生长不好。通常会在桥下斜坡的土面上安装混凝土板，这些板叫做斜坡铺装，用以防护侵蚀。（第四章包括有关桥梁的更多细节。）
- en: One problem with a sloped embankment is how much space it takes up. In urban
    areas, approach embankments frequently rely on retaining walls for support, freeing
    up valuable space. These retaining walls often consist of reinforcing elements
    layered into the embankment with interlocking concrete facing panels, a technique
    called *mechanically stabilized earth*. (See the previous section for more information
    about retaining walls.)

  zh: 一个斜坡路堤的问题是它占据的空间。城市地区，接近桥梁的路堤通常依赖挡土墙提供支撑，从而腾出宝贵的空间。这些挡土墙通常由加固元素与互锁的混凝土面板层叠而成，这种技术被称为*机械加固土壤*。（有关挡土墙的更多信息，请参见前一节。）
- en: Interchanges become more complicated when two or more highways meet. The ideal
    junction allows each traffic stream to transition onto any crossing roadway in
    any direction without interruption. There are many ways to accomplish such connectivity,
    each with its own advantages and disadvantages. One of the most basic types is
    the cloverleaf interchange, named for its distinctive shape on a map. In a cloverleaf
    interchange, the vehicles turning right follow a gentle curve to transition to
    the crossing roadway. The left turners go past the intersection, then follow a
    sharp right-hand loop onto the other route in the opposite direction. Cloverleaf
    interchanges require only a single bridge, so they are relatively inexpensive
    to construct. However, they have some disadvantages too. Most significantly, the
    left-turn entrance ramps come before the exit ramps, forcing traffic entering
    and leaving the highway to weave across each other. This weaving can significantly
    limit the interchange’s capacity.

  zh: 当两条或更多的高速公路交汇时，交叉口变得更加复杂。理想的交汇点可以让每一股交通流畅地转到任何方向的交叉路上，不受干扰。有很多方法可以实现这种连接，每种方法都有其优点和缺点。最基本的一种是叶形立交，它因其在地图上独特的形状而得名。在叶形立交中，右转的车辆会沿着一个平缓的曲线转到交叉路段。左转的车辆则会经过交叉口，然后沿着一个急转弯的右环道驶入对向车道。叶形立交只需要一座桥梁，因此建造成本相对较低。然而，它也有一些缺点。最显著的是，左转入口匝道位于出口匝道之前，导致进出高速公路的车辆需要交错行驶。这种交错行驶会显著限制交汇口的通行能力。
- en: Another type of grade-separated junction is the stack interchange. In this type
    of junction, the right turns usually remain at grade, just like a cloverleaf.
    However, the left turns are handled by elevated ramps, often called flyovers.
    The two pairs of left-turning ramps must be stacked above or below the highways,
    giving this interchange its name. Stack interchanges generally have the highest
    capacity of all different types of four-way junctions. However, they are complex
    and expensive structures due to the many layers of elevated roadways required.

  zh: 另一种类型的高架交汇点是堆叠式立交。在这种类型的交汇点中，右转车辆通常保持在地面上，就像叶形立交一样。然而，左转车辆则通过高架匝道来处理，这些匝道通常被称为高架桥。这两对左转匝道必须堆叠在高速公路的上方或下方，这也赋予了这种立交其名字。堆叠式立交通常具有所有四向交汇点中最高的通行能力。然而，由于需要多层高架道路，它们通常是复杂且昂贵的结构。
- en: 'Many other types of highway interchanges exist, and most junctions found in
    the real world borrow elements from various designs. Urban areas put many constraints
    on such massive structures, including the number, size, and direction of roads
    connected and the available space for all those ramps (not to mention the two
    ever-present constraints on all infrastructure projects: schedule and budget).
    The largest and most complex interchanges are often referred to as *spaghetti
    junctions*, towering tangles of interweaving ramps transitioning traffic in every
    direction. On road trips, I am guilty of devising my routes to make sure I pass
    over each interchange’s very top level to get the best (if momentary) views of
    the city.'

  zh: 还有许多其他类型的高速公路交汇点，大多数现实世界中的交叉口都借用了各种设计元素。城市地区对这种庞大的结构有许多限制，包括连接道路的数量、大小、方向以及所有匝道所需的空间（更不用说所有基础设施项目中那两个始终存在的限制：工期和预算）。最大的、最复杂的立交常被称为*意大利面立交*，是交织的匝道组成的巨型迷宫，交通在各个方向间流动。在长途旅行中，我也常常设计路线，确保我能经过每个立交的最上层，以便能获得最好的（即便是短暂的）城市景观。

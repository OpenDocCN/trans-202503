    “How’d it go?” she asked the moment he shut the door.

    rent for my office.” He held up a small bag of coins.

    to private eyes. But I hear you got one, and a promotion. Well done, Detective
    Notation. It’s quite a step up.”

    . maybe . . .”

    he tells me you recommended it.”

    he added, “Don’t take it personally. He was never going to offer me a spot on
    the force again. The captain and I have a long history, longer than a single case
    can erase. Anyway, the private eye life suits me better.”

    his hand to stop her before she could get too excited, and added, “As an independent

    and take over the kingdom.”

    arrest one of their more active members.”

    it’s possible that he was also one of the less capable members. Princess Ann is
    concerned that Socks’s attempted prison break will inspire some of the league’s
    more senior and competent members.”

    contractor, of course.”

    evil organization. But it just so happens that search problems are my specialty.”

    scary. We enjoy playing games because they act like windows into other worlds,
    worlds that move and change as we play with them, worlds whose rules are different
    than our own. (Sometimes these rules seem to make more sense than ours.) Games
    can be places we visit for a short time or places we get lost in for long stretches
    at a time. Through games, we can try on other personas and explore different perspectives.

    In fact, our oldest ancestors made their own games from sheep’s bones (the very

    call *Mancala*. Tic-tac-toe was first played more than 3,000 years ago in Egypt!

- en: 'Games existed long before other activities, such as writing, painting, and
    3D movies. It seems like people were born to play. Whenever a group of people
    agrees to play by a certain set of rules, a new game is born. As these games pass
    on to new players, the new group puts its own unique spin on it. For example,
    a tag player might wonder, “Wouldn’t tag be more exciting if you could *rescue*
    people who’ve been tagged?” And just like that, a new rule is born: games grow
    and change over time, like weird plants.'

- en: Games that are designed by a group of people instead of just one person are
    called *folk games*. No one person invented tag. More likely, tag had a million
    different authors who each added their own little touches. This is why so many
    different versions of tag, like flashlight tag, freeze tag, and kick the can,
    exist today. All it took was someone to come up with another, more fun, way to
    play the game, and the rest was history.

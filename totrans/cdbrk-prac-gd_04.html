<p class="BodyFirst">As you will certainly have noticed, this Zodiac copycat cryptogram was encrypted with a monoalphabetic substitution cipher of the different-alphabet type. However, unlike the ciphertexts we saw in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 3"><a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a></span>, this one doesn’t contain spaces between the words. Crypto puzzle fans and members of the American Cryptogram Association typically use the term <em>Patristocrat</em> to refer to monoalphabetic substitution ciphers without spaces, especially ones that use Latin letters.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure4-1">Figure 4-1</a>: This message by an alleged murderer is encrypted in a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. It doesn’t contain spaces.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It should be clear that the absence of spaces makes a Patristocrat more difficult to break than an Aristocrat cipher. However, Patristocrats are more difficult for the legitimate recipient to handle, too, because it is sometimes hard to correctly determine the word boundaries when decrypting the message. Ambiguities may appear. For instance, <code class="bold">YOUDONTGETMEAPARTOFTHEUNION</code> may mean “You don’t get me, a part of the union,” or “You don’t get me apart of the union.”</p>
<p>For this reason, we encounter Patristocrat ciphers a lot less in practice than ordinary simple substitution ciphers. Still, this kind of encryption is far from infrequent and therefore should be studied by everybody interested in codebreaking.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">If the text you are looking at has no pattern of word breaks, or if this patten is too regular (consisting, for instance, of groups of five characters), you may be dealing with a Patristocrat. A Patristocrat will generally have the same letter variety as other simple substitution cryptograms, which means that frequency analysis and the index of coincidence are helpful tools to detect it.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s look at a cryptogram published by the NSA. As many readers might know, the NSA is quite active on social media, publishing crypto puzzles on Facebook (NSAUSGov) and Twitter (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/@NSAUSGov">@NSAUSGov</a>). If you’re interested in a career at this agency, solving these challenges might be a good way to get their attention. The ciphertext in <a href="#figure4-2" id="figureanchor4-2">Figure 4-2</a> is the first of four challenge ciphers that the NSA announced via Twitter in May 2014. Because each cipher was tweeted on a Monday, they are referred to as the “NSA Monday Challenges.”<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c04-endnote-2" id="c04-noteref-2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Don’t let the spaces confuse you. They separate blocks of twelve letters and do not correspond to the word separations in the plaintext. Here’s a frequency analysis:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="182" src="image_fi/502727c04/g04002.png" width="694"/></figure>
<p>The frequencies are consistent with a simple substitution cipher. The index of coincidence of the ciphertext is 6.7%, which is exactly the expected value of an English text. So, it makes sense to assume that this first NSA Monday Challenge is a Patristocrat.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">The first NSA Monday Challenge can be solved within seconds by a computer, using techniques such as hill climbing (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 16"><a href="c16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a></span>). To do so, you could use the cryptogram solver available as a part of Tyler Akins’ Cipher Tools at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/">https://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/</a> or CrypTool 2. For those who prefer to solve cryptograms by hand, read on.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502727c04-0001"><a class="XrefDestination" id="Frequencyanalysisusingdigraphs"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c04-006"/>Frequency analysis using digraphs</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Clearly, frequency analysis can be very helpful for breaking a Patristocrat, but we can use a few additional statistics in our analyses. The first involves <em>digraphs</em>, or consecutive letter pairs, that appear in the text. Here is a frequency analysis of digraphs in the first NSA Monday Challenge:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="133" src="image_fi/502727c04/g04003.png" width="620"/></figure>
<p>To make use of these statistics, we need a few further facts about the English language:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The most frequent digraph in the English language is <em>EN</em>.</li>
<li>The digraph <em>ER</em> is frequent in both directions: <em>ER</em>/<em>RE</em>.</li>
<li>The most frequent digraph consisting of doubled letters is <em>LL</em>, followed by <em>TT</em> and <em>SS</em>.</li>
<li>The digraphs <em>AA</em> and <em>II</em> are very rare in English, although <em>A</em> and <em>I</em> are frequent standalone letters.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more information about English digraphs in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix B">Appendix B</span>.</p>
<p>You might initially assume that the most frequent digraph in the ciphertext corresponds to the most frequent one in the English language. However, this assumption doesn’t work very well for a ciphertext of only about a hundred letters. Nevertheless, knowledge of digraph frequencies can be helpful, as will become clear.</p>
<p>Before we move on, let’s also perform a triple-letter (trigraph) analysis of the ciphertext. This analysis reveals that the trigraphs <code>PQE</code> and <code>PCA</code> appear twice, while all other groupings of three letters have a frequency of one. The most frequent trigraph in the English language is <em>THE</em>, followed by <em>AND</em>, <em>ING</em>, <em>ENT</em>, <em>ION</em>, <em>HER</em>, <em>FOR</em>, and <em>THA</em> (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix B">Appendix B</span> for additional trigraph statistics).</p>
<p>Trigraph frequencies may be quite helpful for breaking longer ciphertexts, but they are not relevant here because only two trigraphs appear more than once in the challenge. For similar reasons, tetragraph (four-letter), pentagraph (five-letter), and hexagraph (six-letter) frequencies are of no <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_55" title="55"/>use in this context, though, believe it or not, they all have been used by codebreakers. In general, a group of <em>n</em> letters is referred to as an <em>n-graph</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s now try to apply the statistics we have computed. As shown in our initial frequency analysis, the most frequent letter in the first NSA Monday Challenge ciphertext is <code>P</code> (12.5%), followed by <code>C</code> (11.54%) and <code>I</code> (10.58%). So, let’s assume that these letters stand for <code class="bold">E</code>, <code class="bold">T</code>, and <code class="bold">A</code>, the most frequent letters in the English language. There are several possibilities for how to map <code>P</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>I</code> onto <code class="bold">E</code>, <code class="bold">T</code>, and <code class="bold">A</code>, starting with the following option:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">* * T * * * * * A * * * * * * E * * * * * * * * * *</code></p>
<p>We could check the plausibility of this assumption by taking a look at the resulting digraphs, either by hand or by using modern tools such as Cipher Tools or CrypTool 2, which produces the following:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="keyline" height="65" src="image_fi/502727c04/g04004.png" width="694"/></figure>
<p>It is immediately clear that a few things don’t look plausible. For example, the digraph <code class="bold">AA</code> (which appears twice) and the digraph <code class="bold">AE</code> are not very common in English. We’re probably on the wrong track.</p>
<p>We therefore try another assumption:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">* * A * * * * * T * * * * * * E * * * * * * * * * *</code></p>
<p>This renders the following plaintext candidate:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>*E*AA*******EA*AAE*T*A*****EA**E?**T***E**TE******E****E*E**TT*****T*E*TT**T**T*A*E*A****AT*A*******EA***</code></p>
<p>Again, we have two <code class="bold">AA</code>s, which is not very likely. Moreover, the trigraph <code class="bold">AAE</code> appears in the plaintext but is very rare in the English language. Our guess was apparently wrong again.</p>
<p>Now, let’s try a third assumption:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">* * T * * * * * E * * * * * * A * * * * * * * * * *</code></p>
<p>This renders as follows:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>*A*TT*******AT*TTA*E*T*****AT**A?**E***A**EA******A****A*A**EE*****E*A*EE**E**E*T*A*T****TE*T*******AT***</code></p>
<p>This is the best result so far, so let’s stick with it.</p>
<p>Examining the results further, it becomes apparent that the missing letter (a ciphertext <code>A</code>) in <code class="bold">AT*TTA</code> is probably a vowel. As <code class="bold">A</code> and <code class="bold">E</code> are already in use, this letter can only be <code class="bold">I</code>, <code class="bold">O</code>, <code class="bold">U</code>, or <code class="bold">Y</code>. If <code class="bold">I</code> is correct, we get the digraph <code class="bold">IT</code>, which is a frequent English word. Let’s try this:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">I * T * * * * * E * * * * * * A * * * * * * * * * *</code></p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_56" title="56"/>This renders as the following:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>*A*TT*******ATITTA*E*T*****AT**A?**E***A**EA******A*I**A*A**EE*****E*A*EE**E**E*TIA*T****TE*TI******ATI**</code></p>
<p>This looks good; it could be English, and there is nothing that shows up as a red flag. What can we try next? The string <code class="bold">ATI**</code> at the end might stand for <code class="bold">ATING</code>, as in <code class="bold">RATING</code> or <code class="bold">SKATING</code>. Let’s add <code class="bold">N</code> and <code class="bold">G</code> to our table:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">I * T N * G * * E * * * * * * A * * * * * * * * * *</code></p>
<p>We now get this:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>*AGTTN*GN***ATITTA*E*TN*N**ATG*A?**E***A**EA***NG*A*IG*A*A**EE***N*E*A*EE**E**EGTIA*TN**NTE*TIG*N**GATING</code></p>
<p><code class="bold">AGTTN</code> and <code class="bold">GTIA</code> are not very likely in an English text. Moreover, the word <code class="bold">GATING</code> at the end doesn’t make much sense. <em>EN</em>, the most frequent English digraph, doesn’t appear at all in this plaintext candidate. Altogether, this means that our assumption concerning <code class="bold">N</code> and <code class="bold">G</code> is probably wrong.</p>
<p>Perhaps the last five letters are not <code class="bold">ATING</code>, but <code class="bold">ATION</code>. There are many words with this ending, for instance, <code class="bold">STATION</code>, <code class="bold">RELATION</code>, and <code class="bold">FRUSTRATION</code>. Let’s check this guess:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">I * T O * N * * E * * * * * * A * * * * * * * * * *</code></p>
<p>Here is our plaintext candidate:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>*ANTTO*NO***ATITTA*E*TO*O**ATN*A?**E***A**EA***ON*A*IN*A*A**EE***O*E*A*EE**E**ENTIA*TO**OTE*TIN*O**NATION</code></p>
<p>This looks pretty good. <code class="bold">NATION</code> as the last word in an NSA cryptogram is quite plausible. The digraph <code class="bold">EN</code>, which we expect to be frequent, shows up once. Also, we can now guess several additional words: <code class="bold">O**NATION</code> probably means <code class="bold">OUR NATION</code>; <code class="bold">E**ENTIA*</code> could stand for <code class="bold">ESSENTIAL</code>; and <code class="bold">*ANTTO</code> most likely represents <code class="bold">WANT TO</code>. This gives us several more letters:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">I * T O * N * * E * R * * L * A * S * W * U * * * *</code></p>
<p>Here is our next plaintext candidate:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>WANTTO*NOWW*ATITTA*ESTOWOR*ATNSA?**E***A**EA***ON*A*IN*A*ASWEE**LORE*AREERSESSENTIALTO*ROTE*TIN*OURNATION</code></p>
<p>Guessing the remaining letters is straightforward. Here’s the plaintext of the first NSA Monday Challenge:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO WORK AT NSA? CHECK BACK EACH MONDAY IN MAY AS WE EXPLORE CAREERS ESSENTIAL TO PROTECTING OUR NATION.</code></p>
<p>Here’s the substitution table (ciphertext letters marked with <code>?</code> are those for which the corresponding plaintext letter does not exist):</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_57" title="57"/><code>Plaintext:  </code><code class="bold">A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</code></p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Other techniques can help us decipher Patristocrats. Let’s look at the first NSA Monday Challenge (including the frequency chart) again:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>tpfccdlfdtte pcaccplircdt dklpcfrp?qeiq lhpqlipqeodf gpwafopwprti izxndkiqpkii krirrifcapnc dxkdciqcafmd vkfpcadf.</code></p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="184" src="image_fi/502727c04/g04005.png" width="694"/></figure>
<p>One possibility is to start by guessing a word. This would be a lot easier if we knew the positions of the spaces, but this is not the case here. Still, word guessing may work. We know that the NSA is the sender of the message, so searching for the trigraph <code class="bold">NSA</code> seems like a good idea. This search won’t work, however, as this set of letters is hard to spot in the more than one hundred trigraphs we would have to check.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that we know from some source that the word <code class="bold">CAREER</code> appears in the plaintext (after all, <code class="bold">CAREER</code> is a likely word in an NSA challenge cryptogram made to attract talented codebreakers). Now we can use it as a crib. The word <code class="bold">CAREER</code> contains the string <code class="bold">REER</code>, which has a letter pattern of type 1221. If we search for this pattern in the ciphertext, we find two strings of this kind:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><code>KIIK</code>: This looks like a good candidate.</li>
<li><code>IRRI</code>: There’s an <code>R</code> left of the first <code>I</code>, so the letter pattern is actually 21221. This doesn’t fit with <code class="bold">CAREER</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that <code>KIIK</code> is the only string that fits. If our guess is correct, <code>QPKIIK</code> stands for <code class="bold">CAREER</code>. The identified letters <code class="bold">A</code>, <code class="bold">C</code>, <code class="bold">E</code>, and <code class="bold">R</code> should be enough to determine the remaining letters. We leave the rest of the deciphering process to the reader.</p>

<p>Olsson saw that the cryptogram contained twenty-three distinct numbers. A frequency analysis revealed that it was consistent with a simple substitution ciphertext. To break the cipher, Olsson first tried to guess words—a difficult task, as the message didn’t contain spaces. Following a systematic approach, Olsson analyzed 840 letter combinations of various lengths in the ciphertext and checked each one to see if it could represent a certain word. The breakthrough came when he assumed that the sequence <code>38</code>, <code>9</code>, <code>5</code>, <code>10</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>5</code> stood for <code class="bold">PLEASE</code>—a guess that proved correct. Knowing five letters, Olsson could then identify all the others. Here are the first eight lines of the plaintext. (It contains many mistakes and unusual spellings.)</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Rudyard Kipling was the author of many famous tales, such as those found in <em>The</em> <em>Jungle Book</em> (1894). Within his considerable body of work are the <em>Just So Stories</em> (1902) for children, one of which is “How the First Letter Was Written.” The story’s original print included an illustration between two sequences of symbols (<a href="#figure4-5" id="figureanchor4-5">Figure 4-5</a>). These symbols are a message encrypted in a Patristocrat style. Can you break it?</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Several unsolved cryptograms appear to be English texts encrypted with substitution ciphers without spaces. We’ll introduce three of them.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502727c04-0007"><a class="XrefDestination" id="TheDorabellacryptogram"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c04-015"/>The Dorabella cryptogram</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">The Dorabella cryptogram is extremely well known. It is covered in everything from David Kahn’s 1967 classic <em>The Codebreakers</em> (including the 1996 edition),<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c04-endnote-7" id="c04-noteref-7">7</a></sup> to Elonka’s “Famous Unsolved Codes and Ciphers” page,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c04-endnote-8" id="c04-noteref-8">8</a></sup> to Klaus’s “Top 50 Unsolved Cryptograms” list.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c04-endnote-9" id="c04-noteref-9">9</a></sup></p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_62" title="62"/>British composer Edward Elgar (1857–1934) not only created famous music pieces, such as the early twentieth-century march “Pomp and Circumstance,” but also was fond of cryptography. In 1897, when his wife Alice sent a thank-you letter to the Penny family, he included an encrypted note to his friend, the twenty-three-year-old Dora Penny (<a href="#figure4-6" id="figureanchor4-6">Figure 4-6</a>).<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c04-endnote-10" id="c04-noteref-10">10</a></sup> This ciphertext is referred to as the Dorabella cryptogram, and despite analysis by many people (from amateurs to renowned codebreakers) for over a century, it has never been solved.</p>

</figure>
<p>The frequency distribution of the Dorabella cryptogram fits well with a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, but this has not led to the solution. There are many ways to explain this. Elgar might have deliberately avoided words containing Es. Others have suggested that the Dorabella cryptogram might encrypt a melody (i.e., musical notes), rather than a text. It is also possible that the plaintext is in a language other than English. Or, of course, the Dorabella cryptogram may not be a simple substitution cipher at all. If you want to dig deeper, check out Craig Bauer’s 2017 book <em>Unsolved!</em><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c04-endnote-11" id="c04-noteref-11">11</a></sup> It provides a comprehensive analysis of the Dorabella cryptogram.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Another well-known unsolved cryptogram is inscribed on seven Chinese gold bars, as described on the International Association for Cryptologic Research website in 1996.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c04-endnote-12" id="c04-noteref-12">12</a></sup> These gold bars were allegedly issued to a General Wang in Shanghai, China, in 1933. They appear to represent metal certificates related to a bank deposit with a US bank. The gold bars bear pictures, Chinese writing, some form of script writing, and cryptograms in Latin letters. The Chinese writing discusses a transaction in excess of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_63" title="63"/>$300 million. The cryptograms consist of sixteen encrypted lines, some of which are repeated:</p>

<p>It is difficult to know how to categorize this cryptogram, as it is unsolved. We are making a guess that it might be a Patristocrat, but of course, it might be some other system.</p>
<p>There has been an update to this mystery since the publication of this book’s first edition: on December 10, 2020, we attempted to contact the owner of the bars but found the phone number disconnected. We had more luck contacting the listed attorney, Peter Bisno. He confirmed that he had seen the bars themselves and that they were “large,” around the size of television remote controls. He informed us that there had been some effort to contact banks about them in the 1990s, but that it hadn’t gone anywhere and that he had dropped his research. He did not know anything more about the current location of the bars.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Another difficult-to-categorize unsolved crypto mystery is by US amateur artist James Hampton (1909–1964), who left behind an artwork known as <em>The Throne of the Third Heaven</em><em> of the Nations’ Millennium General Assembly</em>. He created this massive, altar-like installation over several years, starting in 1950, out of cardboard, aluminum foil, and other cheap materials. Today, it is on display in the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC. Hampton was also the author of manually encrypted notes, including a notebook with over a hundred pages of ciphertext (<a href="#figure4-7" id="figureanchor4-7">Figure 4-7</a>).<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c04-endnote-13" id="c04-noteref-13">13</a></sup> None of his notes have ever been deciphered. Scans of all the pages are available online.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c04-endnote-14" id="c04-noteref-14">14</a></sup></p>

<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">T</span>iming is everything. It’s true for comedy, it’s true for life overall, and it’s certainly true for Android’s success. For Android, it was the difference between being an interesting mobile platform (of which there were several at the time) and becoming an operating system that now runs on over three billion devices worldwide.</p>
<p>There are many aspects to the timing of Android: How fast the team could ship 1.0 and deliver update releases, when hardware was available and fast enough for this new device form factor, and on and on. But the most important element of timing can be summarized in one word: <em>competition</em>.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c50-0001"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_367" title="367"/>Competition and Collaboration</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">After the iPhone was announced, manufacturers were desperate for a touchscreen offering of their own to compete in the evolving smartphone market. Given the closed ecosystem of the iPhone, these other companies were on their own to create a compelling system, but nobody was in a good place to do that. Meanwhile, Android had been working on a platform that was intended to support different kinds of devices and requirements including, for example, a touchscreen.</p>
<p>The timing was right for those other companies to collaborate with Android and use that open source platform to create their own smartphone devices.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c50-0002">Mobile Hardware</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Timing also had a positive impact on hardware capability at that time. CPUs, GPUs, memory, and display technology all converged to enable more powerful smartphones. This increase in hardware capabilities enabled not only new kinds of phones, but also an entirely new niche of computing hardware that could break away from the bonds of the existing, entrenched platform players of the old PC world.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c50-0003">Hiring</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Timing also had an impact on building the original team. Android was staffing up at a time when a core group of OS people from companies like PalmSource, Danger, and Microsoft were available and anxious to take on a new project together. The fact that all of these people joined around the same time meant that Android was jump-started by a group of people who not only had relevant experience, but also had worked together already and didn’t have to spend time building team dynamics. They just got down to work.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c50-0004">Execution</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The final part of timing was that the team was able to move fast enough to capitalize on the opening they were given. For one thing, the team had been able to build up the core Android platform to a reasonable place by the time the iPhone was announced, so it was nearly ready for manufacturers that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_368" title="368"/>needed a competing solution quickly. Also, the team was able to pivot in reaction to the new reality of touchscreens, getting 1.0 and the G1 to market before other viable solutions could.</p>
<p>Without the unique combination of hardware capabilities that enabled smartphones, and the singular impact that the iPhone had on an industry thrashing about for a way to compete with that new device, Android may not have found a foothold, and would have just been another of the many failures littering the curbside of mobile device history. Instead, it was able to become a viable alternative at the right time for manufacturers across the world to ship their own smartphones, enabling the Android ecosystem that we know today.</p>

I asked everyone I interviewed why they thought it all eventually worked. People cited many different reasons, but there was apparently some group consensus on this particular factor. </p></aside>
